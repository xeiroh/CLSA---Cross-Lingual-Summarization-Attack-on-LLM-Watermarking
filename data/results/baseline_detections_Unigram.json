Abdelaziz El Yechioui Ourzat, 30, followed the pair to the address before attacking her, Winchester Crown Court heard. Ourzat, who previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter, will be sentenced on 17 March. At the time of the killing, Ourzat was on bail with the condition he did not contact Ms Ortiz-Lozano after being arrested for causing criminal damage to her home. On the night of the murder, Ourzat monitored Ms Ortiz-Lozano for half an hour as she met her date at a pub in London Road, prosecutors said. The pair left the venue when they spotted him watching them, the court was told. He was then caught on CCTV following them as they walked one mile to Ms Ortiz-Lozano's home. Ourzat entered the property and attacked her, sustaining injuries himself for which he was treated in hospital, police said. He subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility but was found guilty of murder after a two-week trial. Hampshire Constabulary said Ourzat, of King George's Avenue, and Ms Ortiz-Lozano had previously been in a 12-year relationship after meeting at school in Spain. Det Insp Toby Elcock of the Major Crime Team said Ourzat's \"abusive and jealous behaviour\" had ended in Ms Ortiz-Lozano's \"brutal murder\". He said: \"Our thoughts remain with Cristina's friends and family who are still dealing with this unimaginable loss.\" In a previous statement, Ms Ortiz-Lozano's family said: \"We will never forget your vitality, your happiness or your determination to achieve your goals. \"The word 'impossible' was not in your vocabulary. We will always love you and miss you.\" Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk.

The gym, in Wallasey, Wirral, in which Mr Ferguson-Prayogg trained, tweeted: \"R.I.P. to one of our finest boxers... we are all totally devastated.\" Staff at the Forum said they were saddened by the news. Shaun White, from Sheffield, was Mr Ferguson-Prayogg's opponent on Saturday. Mr White told reporters that following the fight Mr Ferguson-Prayogg left the ring and then collapsed. A spokeswoman from East Midlands Ambulance Service said it received a call at about 17:24 BST on Saturday, reporting \"a male who had lost consciousness\". However, it is unclear how Mr Ferguson-Prayogg died. Lance Ferguson-Prayogg trained at 12 Quays Gym in Wallasey and the event was organised by a promoter called Dukeries Fightcard. The show was abandoned after Mr Ferguson-Prayogg collapsed. Damian Hucker from Dukeries Fightcard told the Nottingham Post: \"I am truly devastated by his death and will never be involved in boxing again. \"I was already planning on leaving the boxing scene as I'm about to start training as a paramedic but this has confirmed that for me now.\" 'Needs more safety' Mr Ferguson-Prayogg's trainer Micky Allen, who confirmed the boxer had a partner and daughter, said he was grateful for the support he has had from well-wishers on Facebook. He said: \"I just want to thank every single person... Letting you all know that I'm ok, just worried more on Lance's family, partner and child. \"I keep thinking of all the fights we attended and was successful [in]. Skitting at each other and the 12 quays gang.\" Marcellus Baz, from the Nottingham School of Boxing, described the bout Ferguson-Prayogg took part in as \"white collar boxing\". He said: \"It's not a governed sport... it's got to be governed, it's got to have more safety. \"England boxing is governed, it's monitored, the safety is right up there where young people are checked before [and after] they go 1,2,3. Whereas this is just the white collar stuff, just people that haven't boxed in a long time taking the gloves on again.\"\n\n## Comments\n\nAnastassja1 (Anastassja Alieva)\nWednesday 06 November 2019\n14:38\n\n106 views\nKimberlin Rowe(Alieva)\nWednesday 06 November 2019\n16:26\n\n1\n0</s>",
