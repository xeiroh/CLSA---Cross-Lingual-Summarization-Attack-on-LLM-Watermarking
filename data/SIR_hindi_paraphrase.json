in Wales. Despite the existence of legal requirements to provide reasonable access to services for disabled individuals, many health boards in the country are failing to comply with these obligations. According to the article, 70% of British Sign Language users admitted to Welsh hospitals were not provided with an interpreter, and a separate report shows that 90% of GPs in Wales are failing to provide reasonable alternative methods for deaf people to book appointments. These statistics are alarming and suggest a systemic lack of awareness and sensitivity towards the needs of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\n\nIt is clear that more needs to be done to improve access for these individuals. The health boards in Wales are encouraged to review their policies and procedures to ensure that they are meeting the legal requirements set out in the Equality Act 2010. Furthermore, healthcare providers at all levels, from hospitals to primary care, should prioritize the provision of reasonable access for disabled individuals, including those with hearing impairments. This may involve investing in more resources, such as interpreters, hearing loop systems, and accessible online booking options, to improve access to services for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.\n\nIn conclusion, the lack of access to services for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in Wales is a serious issue that requires immediate attention. Healthcare providers and health boards in the country must prioritize the inclusion and accessibility of these individuals and work towards providing reasonable access to services.","2":"1. The World Health Organization is expected to announce later its view of how to circulate the research safely to scientists studying the H5N1 virus in humans.\n\n2. Dr Bruce Alberts, editor of Science, was asked by US security advisers not to publish parts of the work because of concerns it could help terrorists to develop a biological weapon.\n\n3. He says it is important to get the research out quickly to scientists and health officials monitoring the virus.\n\n4. The controversy is centred on two research papers - one of which was submitted to Science, the other to another leading journal, Nature, last year.\n\n5. They showed that the H5N1 virus could relatively easily mutate into a form that could spread rapidly among the human population.\n\n6. The studies prompted the US National Security Advisory Board for Biotechnology (NSABB) to ask both journals last November to redact some sensitive parts of the research, which it believed could be used by terrorists to develop such a virus.\n\n7. The request caused outcry among some scientists who believed that it was an infringement of academic freedom.\n\n8. Some pointed out that the scientists had given presentations about their work at conferences and the details were already widely circulated, so redaction would have little purpose.\n\n9. The scientists who carried out the research, and the journals concerned, have been considering the request and listening to suggestions as to how the research results could be redacted in the scientific journals, but distributed to bona fide researchers who urgently need the information.","3":"- Amol Rajan Media editor I can reveal that Westmonster is co-owned by Michael Heaver, former press adviser to Nigel Farage. The 27-year-old, who together with Mr Banks will own 50% of the website, will edit it day to day. Modelled on the Drudge Report, the American aggregator site that generates huge traffic, Westmonster will be powered by the social media reach of Leave.EU, the campaign to which Mr Banks gave close to \u00a37m - the largest donation in British political history. Leave.EU has nearly 800,000 followers on Facebook and Mr Heaver believes he can use that base to generate substantial traffic from day one. Westmonster will publish some original news, and Mr Heaver hopes to enlist more celebrity writers than backbench MPs. The site will launch with an article from Nigel Farage, and Mr Heaver is open about wanting to ape the opinionated, anti-establishment, highly provocative tone of Breitbart. This launch is significant for several reasons. It shows that the anti-establishment media which helped to power the campaign of Donald Trump is coming to Britain. It's no coincidence that Westmonster is launching the day before Mr Trump's inauguration - an event that will be attended, almost alone among Brits, by Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, and Mr Banks's business associate Andy Wigmore, who are together hosting a celebratory party on Saturday night in a hotel across the road from the White House. Banks has booked out an entire floor of the Hay-Adams Hotel on Saturday night, and - logistics permitting - the plan is for the new President to attend, along with his close friend the Governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant.

This volcanic rock is lightweight, bubble-rich and produced by volcano when lava goes through rapid cooling and loss of gases, resulting in formation of large rafts in shallow water. The raft was inadvertently entered by an Australian couple sailing their catamaran to Fiji who reported entering into it by night and their rudder was jammed by rubble and they could not find it again after that, but then they were able to navigate out of this field. They later sent samples to the researchers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia to study. According to associate prof Scott Bryan, a geologist studying the samples, these pumice masses could be seen once in 5 years in the region and is a phenomenon reported over time, usually as islands in the middle of the ocean that people encounter but then can't find again and it is like if the whole surface turns to land. The field has since divided into two main surface masses, with many trailing ribbons of rock and it is drifting westwards towards Fij","8":"1.

They came to the Amazon to find land, and eventually got a plot under an ambitious government program to settle thousands of families along the Transamazon Highway. 4. In the 1990s, they practised slash-and-burn agriculture to plant subsistence crops and pasture for cattle. 5. Some families in Dedel's settlement began to realize that this kind of farming was exhausting the soil and that they needed to find alternative ways to make a living. 6. The settlers began to consider a new kind of economic activity, which involved the sustainable extraction of oils from andiroba, Brazil nut, and cupuacu trees. 7. The transition was not easy, and they had to go through several challenges, including turning to older communities to learn how to extract the oils, setting up a company, and conforming to high technical standards to sell their oils to beauty products manufacturers. 8. Some families gave up because they realized that it would take time to get a good financial return, but many remained enthusiastic. 9. The Seeds of the Forest project aims to provide rural Amazon communities with alternatives to slash-and-burn agriculture, which is environmentally destructive and often leads to deforestation, while helping them to make a decent living by producing and selling organic products.","9":"More than 50 firefighters were called to Deptford Terrace shortly after 18:00 BST to deal with the blaze at a disused recycling facility.

The fans reached 125,000 retweets, and David kept his word, officiating the ceremony in full costume over the weekend. David tweeted a picture of himself and the congregation, and said, \u201cSo me and some fun folks in Springfield, Illinois made good on our promise we made all those months ago.\u201d The bride contacted David back in January and he said he would be on board, but set out a few conditions. First, he asked that the wedding not interfere with the filming schedule of Stranger Things\u2019s third season, and that he be allowed to read a love letter at the wedding and get the first slice of the cake after it was cut. He also asked that the bride retweet his message a certain number of times. The bride and groom did this and David kept his word by officiating the ceremony. This was not David\u2019s first act of kindness, either.

Mark H Durkan, environment minister, says he will not allow hydraulic fracturing to take place in the absence of scientific evidence that it is safe. He believes that in Northern Ireland fracking could harm local people and the environment and that no fracking companies will be given permission to proceed until he is satisfied that he is sure fracking is safe. In addition, he says that in the absence of reliable evidence that fracking is safe, fracking companies are unlikely to be given permission to proceed. He adds that fracking is a controversial, \u201cnovel\u201d (new and different) issue in which he believes that any decision must be taken by ministers collectively, in other words, he believes that ministers in Northern Ireland, \u201cthe Stormont Executive,\u201d must make any decision collectively before fracking can take place.","14":"The homelessness problem in England is rising, and the government is trying to take action to reduce it. A team of experts will be formed to help reduce the number of people living on the street, and measures aim to \"break the homelessness cycle once and for all\". The minister Heather Wheeler has said that she would resign if the problem worsens while she is in office. The government is taking real actions to help people, and judge them by the actual actions, rather than words. The team will include experts from government departments and agencies with specialisms in mental health, housing and addiction. A new homelessness law is coming into force next week, which will oblige councils to provide services to anyone at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a priority need. The Homelessness Reduction Bill will require councils to start assessing someone at risk of homelessness 56 days before losing their home, which is currently only defined as within 28 days. The government is making real efforts to reduce homelessness, and is monitoring the situation carefully to see if the problem is worsening or improving.","15":"TikTok\u2019s owner is in talks with Oracle to sell off some of its businesses in the U.S. and other countries. This comes after Trump threatened to ban the app if it isn\u2019t sold within 90 days. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) has reviewed ByteDance\u2019s purchase of Musical.ly in 2017 and determined that it was a national security threat. In response, Trump is set to order ByteDance to divest TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations within 90 days or face being shut down. Oracle\u2019s chairman Larry Ellison is a supporter of Trump and held a fundraising event for him in February. Trump commented that if Oracle buys TikTok, they should give 20% of the sale price to the U.S. government. Oracle is working with other investment firms to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand operations. This deal is expected to be completed by September 15th. In February, Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, held a high-profile fundraiser for Trump at his private golf course and estate in California. The White House says that CFIUS has recommended that ByteDance divest TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations within 90 days. Trump says that there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that TikTok is being used by ByteDance to breach U.S. security and that they must be removed from U.S. app stores by September 20th or they will be banned in the U.S.","16":"Glendon Spence was seeking refuge in the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre in Brixton, after being pursued by two men armed with knives. He was then attacked and fatally stabbed in the thigh by 17-year-old Rishon Florant, from Waltham Forest, who was found guilty of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey. The sentencing is scheduled for 11 October 2023. Chibuzo Ukonu, 18, was convicted of manslaughter, after denying intending to harm anyone or causing injuries to Mr Spence. The attack, which happened at around 6:45 PM, was captured on CCTV footage. A BMW Series 5 car, which was bought by Ukonu days before the attack, was used to drop off the defendants at the scene. Ukonu admitted being present and in possession of a knife, but denied intending to harm anyone or causing any injuries to Mr Spence. The prosecutor, Julian Evans, told the jury that Glendon ran into the main room and fell to the ground, losing his footing, before falling over again near to a table tennis table, and that as Mr Spence lay on the ground, Florant stabbed him in his right thigh, causing \"sudden and immediate blood loss\". The next day, police arrested Florant as he attempted to take a flight to Uganda from Heathrow Airport, while Ukonu took a coach to Manchester. The defendants did not react as the verdicts were given, but voices could be heard in the public gallery, with a woman angrily shouting they had been convicted \"by an all-white jury\" before walking out. The judge thanked the jury and added that \"emotions are always very high\" in such cases.","17":"By Sarah Finley\n\nTechnology of Business reporter The racing driver and keen cyclist uses a Garmin 810 Edge cycle computer, a heart rate monitor and a power meter. \"The power meter is embedded into my left crank arm and talks via Bluetooth to my Garmin device, as does my heart rate monitor,\" he says. \"I can see my power [the force his legs are generating], which is updated every three seconds, on my Garmin screen and through training and experience know how many watts I can maintain and for how long I can do it,\" he says.\n\nWearable and portable fitness trackers are certainly helping serious athletes like Peter to push themselves to the limit. But what about the rest of us?

In short, do they really work?\n\nWhat's my motivation? \"They've made us all aware of how we treat our bodies, and they have even helped people diagnose things like diabetes and obesity,\" says Collette Johnson, head of marketing at design technology consultancy Plextek. \"But I feel they could go further.\"\n\nLast year the University of Pittsburgh concluded that fitness trackers were \"ineffective at sustaining weight loss\". The two-year study, conducted by the university's School of Education Department of Health and Physical Activity, involved 500 overweight volunteers. All were asked to diet and engage in more exercise, but only half were given a fitness tracker to help them. The study found that the group wearing trackers lost 8lb (3.6kg), but the ones who didn't lost 13lb (5.9kg).\n\n\"Trackers are a reliable measurement of our activity, but we can't rely on them completely,\" says Andrew Lane, professor of sport psychology at the University of Wolverhampton. \"We can't expect just to buy one and that's it - some of the responsibility sits with us too.

The first time since 1959, a Castro is not at the helm of the government. Mr D\u00edaz-Canel had been serving as first vice-president for the past five years. Even though Mr D\u00edaz-Canel was born after the revolution, he is a staunch ally of Ra\u00fal Castro and is not expected to make any radical changes. There was \"no room in Cuba for those who strive for the restoration of capitalism\" he said in his inaugural address. 'The Revolution continues its course' He was elected by the members of the National Assembly, all 605 of whom were voted in in March after standing unopposed. Mr Castro is expected to continue wielding considerable political influence in his role as the leader of Cuba's ruling Communist Party. 'Political continuity': 2. Will Grant, BBC Cuba correspondent 3. Cuba's new President, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, entered the chamber alongside the outgoing president, Ra\u00fal Castro. The moment captured the image of political continuity the Cuban government has been keen to stress: an ordered handover of power from one generation to the next. 4. There was a small surprise, a single dissenting vote to D\u00edaz-Canel's nomination as president, as he was confirmed by just 99.83% of the vote. Still, he had the one and only ballot he really needed: Ra\u00fal Castro's. 5. In his inaugural speech, Mr D\u00edaz-Canel said that his mandate was \"to ensure the continuity of the Cuban revolution at a key historic moment\" and assured the members of the National Assembly that \"the revolution continues its course\". He said that Cuba's foreign policy would remain \"unaltered\" and that any \"necessary changes\" would be decided by the Cuban people. 6. A large part of his speech was dedicated to praising his predecessor in office, to whom he said: \"Cuba needs you.\" This prompted the more than 600 National Assembly members to rise to their feet and give the 86-year-old former leader a standing ovation. Any changes Mr D\u00edaz-Canel will bring in are likely to be gradual, slow-paced and in keeping with the rest of the world's trends, but","19":"High-speed railway (HS2) Ltd agreed to pay for relocation of Water Orton Primary School in Warwickshire because it will lose part of its playing field due to construction.

According to the Alzheimer\u2019s Society in Wales, only 38.5 percent of people in Wales who are living with dementia have been given a diagnosis, and they believe that this is unacceptably low. This is in comparison to other parts of the UK, where 63 percent and 64.4 percent of people living with dementia have been given a diagnosis in Northern Ireland and Scotland, respectively. The Welsh government has acknowledged that there are issues with dementia diagnosis and has asked the National Leadership and Innovation Agency for Health (NLIAH) to look into this matter. The Welsh government is also developing intelligent targets to improve early identification and has set targets to improve this, and they have asked Public Health Wales and NLIAH to develop a training module for GP practices including the whole primary health care team on improving diagnosis, which is underway. The Welsh government anticipates that the Mental Health (Wales) Measure will have an impact, supporting both diagnosis and referral on to memory clinics for those affected by dementia. The Alzheimer\u2019s Society in Wales believes that more needs to be done to improve diagnosis rates in Wales, and that more people need to be made aware of the benefits of diagnosis and medical treatments that are often available. The organization is urging the Welsh government to take action and help ensure that people can live well with the condition.","26":"1) Sweden, which has the world's first \"feminist government,\" has been facing criticism over its foreign policy, particularly over trade minister Ann Linde's recent visit to Iran, during which she wore a headscarf, or hijab, in compliance with Iranian laws.\n2) Iran has a long history of oppressing women through legislation, and many Iranians, including prominent women's rights activists, have criticized the Swedish government's decision to comply with Iranian laws, saying it is \"ruinous to what is called a feminist foreign policy.\"\n3) Sweden's prime minister, Stefan Lofven, has defended the decision, saying that it is not possible to break Iranian laws, and that if all-male delegations were sent, it would be considered discrimination.\n4) Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, has also expressed his support for equality, saying that Iran has made significant progress in women's rights in recent years, and that it is important to respect cultural and religious differences.\n5) The debate over Sweden's foreign policy has sparked a wider conversation about feminist foreign policy, and how it can be implemented in practice while respecting cultural and religious differences.","27":"Sir Ian, chairman of Barclays' UK operations, told the BBC that business leaders wanted to see certainty. He added that it was \u201cextremely unlikely\u201d further negotiations with the EU would produce a different outcome. However, some UK business groups were more sceptical, with one calling it \u201ca step backwards for frictionless trade\u201d. Confidence suffering Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Sir Ian said: \u201cNo deal is perfect, but this deal is actually doable, \u201cIt is, I think, very frustrating to see what appears to be a protracted process when most business leaders would like to see some certainty and get on. \u201cThe chances of yet another round of negotiations are extremely unlikely to yield anything significantly different and now the delay is beginning to affect consumer confidence, particularly investment confidence, and I think we have to push ahead and make the best of what we've got coming down the track.\u201d However, Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, questioned Mr Johnson's deal. He told the BBC: \u201cWhat our members want most of all is the chance to scrutinise it. You wouldn't buy a house having only one week's notice of what the terms look like. You'd want a survey, you'd want to send in the experts, you'd want to know what the structure was and we think that's important now. \u201cWe want to see the government's economic impacts and then we'll make a proper judgement.\u201d 'Inferior' deal Mr Wright also expressed reservations about the impact of the deal on Northern Ireland. \u201cMany of my members already think that the changes in Northern Ireland will make it too expensive for them to do business between Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the terms that may come,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the political declaration has all sorts in it which is aspirational, but we need to know what we're to look at in terms of trade deals and in terms of regulatory alignment and we're worried on both those counts.\u201d The chief executive of manufacturers' organisation","28":"1. Education minister Peter Weir has proposed that primary school children should return to class full-time on 22 March.\n2. The plan also recommends that primaries 4 to 7 students, who have not yet returned to class, should also start face-to-face learning on 22 March. This is the same day that secondary students in years 12 to 14 are due to resume in-person classes.\n3. The executive is expected to meet on Thursday to consider Mr Weir's proposals, which must be in line with health advice.\n4. Mr Weir has argued that the current plan to revert primaries 1 to 3 students, who returned to class on Monday, to remote learning on 22 March does not make \"enormous sense\" and that they should be allowed to continue with face-to-face learning.\n5. Earlier, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the executive wants to ensure all children in Northern Ireland can return to school as \"quickly as possible\". However, he acknowledged that online learning is no substitute for face-to-face learning and that everyone recognizes this fact.\n6. DUP assembly member Paul Givan asked Finance Minister Murphy if he would support Education Minister Weir's proposals, to which Mr Murphy responded that he would be guided by health advice.\n7. The ministers want to do this as quickly as possible, given the safety and transmission rates associated with the pandemic, and online learning is no substitute for face-to-face learning.\n8. However, health minister Robin Swann cautioned that he would not pre-judge the outcome of Thursday's executive meeting, and first minister Arlene Foster reiterated that health advice and other harms must be considered before making a decision.","29":"Highland Council in Scotland is facing a potential shortfall in finances of \u00a396.9m, the fourth worst-case scenario in the UK. This is equivalent to \u00a3411 per resident, making it the highest UK figure. The shortfall is due to lost income from visitor attractions and the loss to the tourism-dominated economy. The council's finance director, Ed Foster, says balancing the deficit will require \"shed loads of pain.\" The BBC's research suggests that financially, Highland has been hit harder than anywhere else in the UK as a result of the virus pandemic. The main sources of income, including tourist car parks, docking fees, and the sale of marine fuel, have been reduced to \"zero overnight\" and the shortfall is projected to reach \u00a396.9m. The \u00a340m in extra expenditure is due to caring for an ageing population through Covid-19. The pandemic has had a significant impact on Scotland's economy, which is expected to contract by 11.4%. This is significantly higher than the UK average and is expected to lead to a rise in unemployment, particularly among young people and those in rural areas. The government is expected to support Scotland through economic stimulus packages and welfare payments, but this could take years to recover.","30":"- Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, has been praised by East Germany's State Security (Stasi) agency for his work as a KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s.\n- The Stasi Records Agency (BStU) said that Mr Putin had been given the Stasi pass to help carry out his KGB work in East Germany.\n- Mr Putin's Stasi pass was renewed every three months, suggesting that he had spied for East Germany while he was working for Moscow's KGB spy agency.\n- However, the Stasi agency said that Mr Putin had no evidence that he had worked for East Germany's Stasi spy agency, although his pass was found among Stasi files in Dresden.\n- Mr Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden between 1985 and 1989, and was awarded a bronze medal by East Germany's communist government in 1989 for his faithful service to the East German army, which was part of the country's Stasi spy network.","31":"12\/19\/2015, The Radisson Blue hotel in Bamako, Mali was attacked by Islamic extremists and security guards.

People who are deaf or have hearing loss often rely on lip reading and facial expressions to understand what is being said, but face masks make this difficult or impossible.\n3. Standard face masks, which have become widespread as countries try to stop the spread of coronavirus, muffle words and obscure the mouth, making it difficult or impossible for deaf or hearing-impaired people to understand what is being said.\n4. Now charities and manufacturers alike are coming up with a solution, in the form of transparent face masks that allow people to see the mouth and facial expressions of the person speaking to them.\n5. The transparent face masks allow deaf and hearing-impaired people to read lips and see facial expressions, which is often critical to understanding what is being said. They are also helpful for autistic people, people with learning difficulties and small children who need to see facial expressions or who may be scared of wearing face masks.\n6. The transparent face masks allow people to see each other's smiles, which is especially important in difficult and uncertain times.\n7. One association in France, Main dans la Main, is making transparent face masks that cover the nose and allow people to see the mouth and facial expressions. They are advising people on how to make their own transparent face masks, and others around the world, including in Scotland, the US and Indonesia, are doing the same.","33":"1.

The Crown Prosecution Service described his behavior as \"deplorable\" and said that it was unknown if he had contracted coronavirus. Newton, 50, of Manor Road, Liscard, Merseyside, was sentenced to six months in prison at Wirral Magistrates' Court on Friday, April 17, 2020. The court heard that the nurse had taken Newton into a cubicle in A&E to monitor his heart rate, where he told her that he was a heroin addict. When she attempted to attach equipment to him, he coughed, spit, and kicked chairs at her. A colleague tried to help, despite having no protective equipment or knowing if Newton was infected with coronavirus. Newton continued to attack security guards and the police officers who eventually managed to arrest him.

The musical is up for eight awards, with nominations for its four stars, including Dame Judi Dench and James Corden. The latest film in the Rambo franchise and comedy A Madea Family Funeral also received eight nominations each. All three films are up for worst film. The Razzies describe themselves as \"Tinseltown's least coveted $4.97 statuette\" and are voted for by more than 1,000 Golden Raspberry Foundation members based in the US and abroad. The star-studded Cats, which is based on Andrew Lloyd Webber's hit musical, was lambasted by the Razzies as a \"widely derided feline flop\". Rambo: Last Blood fared no better, with Sylvester Stallone's fifth film in the series up for worst sequel. Meanwhile, actor and comedian Tyler Perry received worst actor nominations for three of the four characters he played in A Madea Family Funeral. Even Oscar nominees have not been spared. Joker, which is up for 11 Academy Awards on Sunday night, was one of five films nominated for a new category in the Razzies - the worst reckless disregard for human life and public property.","36":"The leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, had outlined a plan to become caretaker prime minister after defeating the government in a no-confidence vote. However, in his invitation letter, he pledged to discuss \"all tactics available\" to stop the UK leaving the European Union (EU) on 31 October without a deal. The Conservative Party chairman, James Cleverly, said Mr Corbyn was offering \"chaos, delay and uncertainty\". The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Change UK, Plaid Cymru, and Green Party all accepted the invitation to meet Mr Corbyn and discuss his proposals. The Labour leader also invited five Conservative MPs opposed to a no-deal exit, but none of them said they would be attending. One of them, Dominic Grieve, said he was not able to make it, but was willing to meet Mr Corbyn at another time. Nigel Farage, Brexit Party leader, criticised those attending, saying they were \"very out of touch with public opinion\" and leaving the EU without an agreement was now \"the only acceptable deal\". Tuesday's meeting between Mr Corbyn and other potential coalition partners was to discuss options to avoid a no-deal Brexit. However, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said a plan involving Mr Corbyn as interim leader was less likely to succeed. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Tuesday's meeting would be \"a pretty frank discussion\" about the options available. The Liberal Democrats, and some potential Tory allies opposed to a no-deal exit, have indicated they won't back a plan that leads to Mr Corbyn in No 10. The meeting was to discuss taking legislative measures to block a potential no-deal, and Mr Starmer said he wanted something with a legal edge.","37":"An increase in the number of patients who were admitted to hospital in England for treatment for injuries sustained by knives over the past five years is reported by the BBC health team.

The essay begins by addressing that the general is almost universally vilified outside of Chile and is considered to be a ruthless dictator who killed many people, but in Chile, opinions are more nuanced. The author then brings in his own opinion that he is a child of the dictatorship and grew up with both sides of the story in his family and he does not believe that they talk about politics and never will.\n- The author then continues by saying that 40 years later, opinions on the military government that Pinochet ran and the socialist government that Salvador Allende ran remain very complex and subject to intense debate and that while most people in Chile abhor the human rights abuses that happened under Pinochet\u2019s rule, he still has a small but very passionate group of right-wing supporters who call him a hero and think he was correct in overthrowing Allende because he stopped Chile from becoming like Cuba.\n- The author then says that in 2006, 60,000 people showed up to mourn Pinochet and that he was mourned by many people who considered him to be a hero and he says that in this day and age, people still hold this belief and that they believe that if Allende had remained in power, then they would have been in danger. The author then cites that this is shown by the fact that in 2016, 11 people in Chilean parliament called Pinochet a hero and that they think he was correct in overthrowing Allende because he was going to turn Chile into Cuba and that Allende\u2019s government was unpopular and that he had taken over the country\u2019s economy through the government and this had made life difficult and that people in Chile could not find work and that they did not have enough to eat and that this was worsened by the fact that Allende did not like white people and this led to many people in Chile to feel discriminated against and this is one of the main reasons that people in Chile do not like Allende and this is one of the main reasons that they like Pinochet and that they think that he was correct in overthrowing Allende and that he was correct in his actions in regards to the economy and that he was correct in his actions in regards to the fact that","43":"In this article, Mark Edward talks about a unique clock called Chronophage, designed and built by an Englishman Dr. John Taylor.

Scientists have calculated the speed and density of ancient air by measuring the depressions left by drops of water that hit the ground. This approach, known as palaeobarometric, will help to constrain models that try to simulate conditions in Archaean times.\n2. The study was presented at the AGU Fall Meeting, and was conducted by Dr Sanjoy Som and his team at NASA's Ames Research Center. The researchers studied ancient raindrops found in Ventersdorp, a town in the North West Province of South Africa, which is home to the Ventersdorp Supergroup, a rock formation that is 2.7 billion years old.\n3. The researchers found that the pits that made up the ancient raindrops had diameters that could tell them something about ancient air pressure. This is because the terminal velocity, or speed, of a raindrop is dependent on air density. In modern conditions, the terminal velocity is about 9m\/s.\n4. The researchers' results suggest that the air pressure 2.7 billion years ago was significantly different from today, with a terminal velocity of 4m\/s. This suggests that the air density was much lower, and that the raindrops would have had a different shape and trajectory than today's drops.\n5. The researchers' findings have important implications for our understanding of ancient conditions, and could help to improve models of ancient climate and atmospheric conditions.\n6. The researchers' study is a great example of the power of scientific observation and deduction, and demonstrates how we can use modern tools to understand ancient conditions.","45":"1.

The project was announced in April 2017 and aims to create the world's most intense beam of neutrinos, which will travel 1,300 km underground from Fermilab in Illinois to a massive detector in South Dakota. DUNE is a successor to two previous projects, one in Europe and one in the United States, and is expected to involve more than 700 scientists from around the world. The project aims to study the behavior of neutrinos, which are elementary particles that are extremely difficult to observe due to their mass and lack of electrical charge. They play a significant role in the mystery of why the universe is composed mostly of matter rather than antimatter, and may help to answer other questions about the fundamental structure of the universe.","49":"1-Nemah Shehadeh, 60, was held after an attempt to deport her to Jordan failed in January 2008 when she claimed to be a stateless Palestinian.

Also hard to miss - a nearly full-length impressionist-style painting of Cohen himself at the press secretary's podium in the White House briefing room. Cohen had prided himself in going above and beyond the line of duty as the president's personal lawyer. He considered himself Trump's protector. He'll do anything for him, telling Vanity Fair last September he'd \"take a bullet\" for the president. The day before the FBI raid, Cohen tweeted a month-old story about him with a Joyce Maynard quote: \"A person who deserves my loyalty receives it\" followed by his own pledge: \"I will always protect our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA\". Cohen is the son of an immigrant who escaped a Nazi concentration camp in Poland. He grew up in Long Island, right outside of New York City, before attending American University in Washington and Cooley Law School in western Michigan. Back in New York, Cohen worked at a law firm, married an Ukrainian immigrant, ran a successful taxi business and made a failed run for New York City Council, all before entering Trump's orbit. Cohen was introduced to Donald Trump by his son, Donald Jr, in 2006. Cohen's family had purchased a number of properties in the Trump World Tower near the United Nations, and Trump hired him to oversee his businesses' interests in that part of New York City. Cohen was also a frequent adviser to Trump, and his daughter Ivanka Trump, on real estate transactions and other legal matters, and was considered an authority on New York real estate and local laws, according to the New York Times. Cohen, 51, had remained in Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, during ups and downs at the Trump Organization and on the campaign. But as Cohen has been named a subject of a federal investigation in New York, his relations with Donald Trump have deteriorated.","51":"According to the author, a study conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom and the United States sought to investigate the safety and potential benefits of using cardiac stem cells in patients undergoing heart bypass surgery. The study's findings, reported in The Lancet, indicate that this procedure could improve the heart's ability to pump blood, although researchers cautioned that more extensive tests were needed to confirm these findings. Other experts expressed reservations about the procedure, noting that techniques using bone marrow stem cells were more established and had already been studied in clinical trials. The study's participants were individuals who underwent heart bypass surgery and had significant heart failure. During the procedure, a small sample of heart tissue was removed and analyzed to isolate cardiac stem cells, which were then cultured until they had reached approximately 2 million cells for each patient. The cells were injected into the heart 100 days after the bypass surgery. Researchers measured changes in the heart's pumping efficiency using the left ventricular ejection fraction, which measures the percentage of blood that is ejected from one of the heart's main chambers with every beat. The study found that the percentage of blood ejected from the heart increased from 30.3% to 38.5% in the 14 patients who received cardiac stem cell treatment, while no significant changes were observed in the 7 patients who did not receive treatment. The researchers cautioned that additional research is needed to confirm the findings and that the procedure is still in the experimental phase. The study was led by Dr. Roberto Bolli, who is affiliated with the University of Louisville, and other researchers from the United Kingdom and the United States. The study is significant because it demonstrates that cardiac stem cells, which can be found in the heart, could be used to treat heart failure in humans, and that injecting these cells into the heart after bypass surgery could improve the heart's pumping efficiency, which is often reduced in individuals with heart failure. The study's findings could be significant, particularly in cases where patients' hearts are too weak to be stimulated to contract with electrical currents or medicines, and could represent a new approach to heart failure treatment.","52":"As a budgeting tool, this is one that many businesses consider to be very effective.

The current pandemic has prompted many healthcare providers to take measures to reduce patient-to-patient and provider-to-patient contact. One such approach is the use of telemedicine or remote patient monitoring. Telemedicine is a system that allows healthcare professionals to provide care to patients remotely, using phone or online technology. Remote patient monitoring is a system that allows healthcare professionals to monitor patients remotely, using wearable devices or other sensors that track key health data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen level. The aim is to reduce person-to-person contact, while providing care and monitoring patients remotely. In addition, healthcare providers must adapt to provide care to patients in quarantine or isolation, while maintaining safety and minimizing spread of infection. This may require additional training and support for healthcare providers, to enable them to provide care safely and effectively to patients in quarantine or isolation.","57":"The bank said the fund, which was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, had invested nearly $1.83bn abroad without using proper procedures.

His parents, who were staunchly Catholic, rejected his homosexuality, and he left home. Gajdics found himself struggling with deep depression and with feeling alienated and estranged, and his doctor referred him to a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist centred on Gajdics' sexuality as the problem, telling him that abuse he suffered as a child created a \"false notion\" that he was homosexual. Gajdics was prescribed a cocktail of psychiatric medications - antidepressants, a sedative and more - and told they were necessary \"to silence the noise\" of his homosexuality. The young Canadian man spent six years under the psychiatrist's care, eventually moving into a house with other patients, \"isolated from the world, definitely not talking to family or former friends, which was prohibited\". He finally left the treatment, got off the medications, and sued the doctor for medical malpractice. One of the grounds for his lawsuit was that the psychiatrist had tried to treat Gajdics' homosexuality as a disease. Gajdics, who recognises what he went through was an extreme form of conversion therapy, believes that any form of conversion therapy is wrong and that the intended goal is to attempt to change an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity. He believes that conversion therapy has been widely discredited by major psychotherapy and medical associations in many countries, including Canada, the US and the UK, and is opposed by the World Health Organisation and the","63":"The BBC has told outside translators to limit the number of strong swear words in foreign language series to avoid offending British TV audiences.

The land was bought weeks before a local council report which could potentially boost the value of the land. The Welsh government had agreed to a \u201cclaw back\u201d contract, meaning the government would share any profits if land rose in price after development and planning permission had been approved. The Welsh government refused to say what the \u201cclaw backs\u201d were, but industry sources say they are not usually higher than 50%. The Auditor General for Wales, Huw Vaughan Thomas, began an investigation into the land deal and included it in his audit of the Welsh government. Mr Thomas then decided to undertake a value for money study, which aims to answer if the land was handled in a way that ensured good value for money. He intends to present his findings to the Public Accounts Committee in the form of a published report. A spokesman for the Welsh government said that \u201cas a Wales Audit Office review is under way, it is inappropriate to comment at this stage.\u201d When BBC Wales originally reported on the Wales Audit Office investigation, Langley Davies, who is managing director of the land buyer, said that \u201cthis was a very commercial transaction carried out by a commercially minded investor.\u201d He argued that \u201cthe transaction was carried out in a fair and transparent manner, and was approved by RIFW's own independent valuers.\u201d","77":"In this article, the author looks into the travel and leisure industry in which travel companies promote certain offers or packages in order to attract more potential customers. The author looks into 30 examples over three weeks and finds that in half the cases, the offers or packages were the same price or cheaper after the offers had ended. The author claims that this could be in breach of consumer laws and that travel companies do this in order to pressure sell to consumers. The author is advising consumers to take their time before deciding to make a booking in order to avoid this situation and to make sure they are getting the best deal. Overall, the author is suggesting that travel companies need to be more transparent in order to avoid this situation in the future and to ensure that consumers are getting the best deal possible.","78":"1.

The university's chancellor, Lord Patten, has stated publicly that it should remain. Similar views were also expressed by Professor Louise Richardson when she became the university's new vice chancellor this week. However, many students still can't get over the statue's presence and feel it's an uncomfortable reminder of the past. One student, Ntokozo Qwabe, says that he feels the same way that he would feel if he saw a statue of Hitler in Germany. The statue is of Cecil John Rhodes, who was revered in the days of the British Empire and was regarded by many as a British colonialist who benefited from Africa's resources at the expense of many South Africans. He also founded an eponymous country, Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe and Zambia. In 2015, a related \"Rhodes Must Fall\" campaign in South Africa was spearheaded on Twitter, and resulted in the removal of a statue in Cape Town University. Qwabe is championing the same campaign in Oxford, hoping for a similar effect. The statue is located at Oriel College, and was funded by Cecil John Rhodes's fortune, which he left to the university to fund scholarships for students around the world to study there. The statue is a reminder to many of Britain's brutal colonial history, and is a source of pain and anger to many students, who feel that it should be removed.","84":"The Environment Agency (EA) issued a flood warning after 40mm of rain fall in the area.

A club in Preston said its business would now \"slowly die\". Alan Hamilton from St Gregory's Catholic and Social Club said he now faced an \"uncertain future\" after \"a confusing message\". Local councils had said the tier three regulations did not include private members' clubs because they operate under a different law which means, in effect, the members own the drink already. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the legislation had been changed so that it included the provision of alcohol on a premises, not just its sale. Tim Tomlinson from Lancaster Pub Watch said it was right that rules \"should be the same\" and \"it has to be consistent\". He said: \"There is no rational reason why a working men's club would have a different set of rules to the pub next door. \"You'll just get thousands of people queuing up to join the working men's club and they'll be chock-a-block.\" 'Expected' Mr Hamilton said no government grant was available for his business but he still had to pay \"expenses like rent, utility cost, and wages.\" \"When your income is below your expenses you are slowly dying,\" he added. He said it was \"a bitter disappointment\" and there was a \"distinct possibility the club would have to close down for good\". There are thousands of members' clubs across England, including Conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde had all advised social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences.

Hill was charged with 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence for the 2015 crash of a 1950s Hawker Hunter. Dr Lupa said Hill may have suffered a lack of oxygen, which could have impaired his decision-making. The defence also presented a report from Dr Lupa, which concluded that the level of G-force experienced during the display may have led to cognitive impairment caused by cerebral hypoxia. Dr Lupa said it was \"difficult to conceive\" why a pilot would deliberately choose to do a manoeuvre known to be dangerous at low altitude unless a serious misjudgement occurred. The prosecution claimed Hill committed to a manoeuvre despite flying too low and too slow. The defence argued Hill was cognitively impaired and \"unable to properly and fully control the aircraft\". Dr Lupa said it was \"difficult to conceive\" why a pilot would deliberately choose to do a manoeuvre known to be dangerous at low altitude unless a serious misjudgement occurred. He also said there was no evidence Hill suffered a loss of consciousness, known as G-loc, or a lesser condition known as A-loc, where \"the lights are on but nobody's home\". However, he said measurable hypoxia can occur at levels significantly below those that can cause G-loc or A-loc.

The Court of Final Appeal, in a unanimous decision, held that Hong Kong\u2019s marriage law is unconstitutional in that it excludes post-operative male to female transsexuals from marrying in their reassigned capacity, and directed that references to \u201cwoman\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d in Hong Kong\u2019s marriage law be read to include post-operative male to female transsexuals. The Court held that the right to marry guaranteed by Hong Kong\u2019s Bill of Rights Ordinance extends to the right of a post-operative male to female transsexual to marry in their reassigned capacity, that in present-day multi-cultural Hong Kong, procreation is no longer regarded as essential to marriage, and that post-operative male to female transsexuals are members of Hong Kong\u2019s minority sexual minority groups, and are entitled to equal treatment in terms of access to legal entitlements and facilities.

The San Francisco-based company was backed by venture capital firms, including Google Ventures, and ride-hailing app Uber. E-scooter startups, including Bird, Spin and Jump, have been backed by tens of millions of dollars, but only a few, including Bird and Lime, have managed to raise more than $100m. The companies have been accused by city officials and others of flouting local laws and making city streets more dangerous, by forcing other cyclists and walkers to swerve or run over to avoid e-scooter riders. Some cities, including Barcelona and Paris, have responded by fining or removing e-scooter firms' vehicles, or by banning e-scooter rentals altogether.","106":"Sadie, the labrador retriever cross, has come to the end of her career as a guide dog for the blind.

There have been concerns about Jeremy Corbyn's performance for months and months. But it was his role, or lack of role, in the campaign to keep the UK in the EU, and his sacking of Hilary Benn in the middle of the night, that has given members of the shadow cabinet the final reasons to quit. Several have already gone; as many as half will be gone by the end of the day, I understand. And documents passed to the BBC suggest Jeremy Corbyn's office sought to delay and water down the Labour Remain campaign. Sources suggest that they are evidence of \"deliberate sabotage\". One email from the leader's office suggests that Mr Corbyn's director of strategy and communications, Seumas Milne, was behind Mr Corbyn's reluctance to take a prominent role in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU. One email, discussing one of the leader's speeches, said it was because of the \"hand of Seumas. If he can't kill it, he will water it down so much to hope nobody notices it\". A series of messages dating back to December seen by the BBC shows correspondence between the party leader's office, the Labour Remain campaign and Labour HQ, discussing the European campaign. It shows how a sentence talking about immigration was removed on one occasion and how Mr Milne refused to sign off a letter signed by 200 MPs after it had already been approved. The documents show concern in Labour HQ and the Labour Remain campaign about Mr Corbyn's commitment to the campaign - one email says: \"What is going on here?\" Another email from Labour Remain sources to the leader's office complains \"there is no EU content here - we agreed to have Europe content in it\". Sources say they show the leader's office was reluctant to give full support to the EU campaign and how difficult it was to get Mr Corbyn to take a prominent role. Mr Corbyn has insisted publicly that he was \"100%\" committed to the campaign to keep the UK in the EU, but his office has been accused of watering down his message and using his name to promote his own agenda rather than to help the Remain campaign","110":"1.

The eventual payout could run into millions of pounds if the compensation claim succeeds. The home provided residential care and education for boys aged 10 to 16 with emotional and behavioral problems, and was run by the De La Salle brothers on behalf of Middlesbrough Diocese. Nigel Feeley, who was sent to St William's in 1972, when he was 13 years old, says that Carragher \"had a gold card to sexually abuse children\" and that he \"abused like giving candy to a baby\". A former worker at the home told Inside Out that \"brothers came and visited [the home] quite regularly and they would take children out\", and that \"it was a perfect opportunity for abuse\". David Greenwood, acting for those claiming compensation, says that St William's is \"the biggest single home where boys were abused\" that he has seen. BBC Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire discovered that the Catholic Church had several opportunities to investigate the abuse but failure to act meant boys continued to be abused for decades. There have been three criminal investigations into abuse at the home, and James Carragher, who was principal from 1976-1990, is serving his third prison sentence for physically and sexually abusing boys there. He was found guilty of 21 indecent assaults and three serious sex offenses, and was also cleared of 30 charges.

There is a fight between these parties and the European establishment, and they do not like this idea because they think that this idea is bad for our country.

Her attacker, Abdelaziz El Yechioui Ourzat, was found guilty of murder and is facing sentencing on March 17, 2021. The attack was particularly shocking because Ourzat had previously been in a relationship with Ms Ortiz-Lozano and had been arrested for causing criminal damage to her home. The attack was particularly violent, with Ourzat stabbing Ms Ortiz-Lozano 23 times and sustaining injuries himself, leading to his hospitalization. The attack was particularly heartbreaking because Ourzat had been monitoring Ms Ortiz-Lozano for half an hour before he attacked her, and was later found to have been suffering from diminished responsibility at the time of the attack. Ourzat had previously been in a relationship with Ms Ortiz-Lozano, and his abusive and jealous behavior had ended in her brutal murder. The family of Ms Ortiz-Lozano is still coming to terms with her death, and they will never forget her vitality, happiness, and determination to achieve her goals. The word 'impossible' was not in her vocabulary, and they will always love and miss her.","186":"This article is about a 15-storey building that was formerly the city's council offices. The building was listed in 2007 and was due to be demolished. However, Urban Splash, a property development company, has announced that they will turn the building into a four-star hotel. Nathan Cornish, the director of Urban Splash, is excited to work on a challenging building and believes it will be a successful project. The building was expensive to maintain and was not serving the needs of the organization, but now that Urban Splash is taking over, they will be able to focus on creating jobs and homes for Plymouth. The plan is to have all council staff out by autumn, but the building is still listed and is a significant part of the city's history and post-war masterplan. The building is a challenging project, but Urban Splash is confident that they can turn it into a successful hotel.","187":"- The Deputy Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, Carl Foulkes, is set to take over the leadership of the North Wales Police force, which is struggling to find a permanent Chief Constable, in November.\n- The appointment was confirmed by the North Wales Police and Crime Panel, and Mr Foulkes, who is originally from Caergwrle, near Wrexham, said that he was ready to take on the challenge and make a difference in the force.\n- He was previously involved in a murder investigation involving a young woman and her daughters, which inspired him to focus his efforts on tackling domestic abuse and reducing violence against women and children.\n- Mr Foulkes also promised to tackle serious and organised crime, especially \"County Lines\" cases, where drug-dealing gangs from cities like Liverpool and Manchester try to expand into new territories, and is ready to make changes to improve the force's performance.","188":"Richard Benyon, former UK environment minister and member for Newbury, criticizes Australia's approach to climate change, which he believes is ignoring the problem at its own peril. He says that Australia's decision to cut renewable energy targets and expand its fossil fuel industry is \"bewildering\" given that Australia has unlimited renewable energy resources like wind and solar power. Mr Benyon says that Mr Abbott's decision to dismiss climate science and believe that Australia must choose between economic growth and tackling climate change speaks to a \"distorted vision\" of what it means to be a conservative. He says that previous UK Conservative leaders such as Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron have proven that it is possible to deal with climate change while pursuing economic growth. He says that to run against the prevailing wind is to risk alienation and that those who, like Mr Abbott, believe that climate change is a left-wing conspiracy based on speculative science are risking Australia's future.","189":"Sir Keir Starmer said the party's MPs had \"different views\" as he set out a series of compromise proposals on retaining access to the single market. He also confirmed that Labour would not back a vote next week on keeping the UK in the single market through membership of the European Economic Area. The UK is due to leave the EU in March next year, after the 2016 referendum. The background to Labour's position Much of the focus at the moment is on what sort of relations the UK will have with the European Union after Brexit. The Conservative government has said that the UK will leave the EU single market and the EU customs union and will no longer be subject to the European Court of Justice, but wants to agree a deal providing as \"frictionless\" trade as possible. The EU says that to have the benefits of the single market the UK must be subject to its rules and also agree to the free movement of people - the latter is something which both main UK parties have currently ruled out. The government's EU Withdrawal Bill (which puts all EU law into UK law to prevent chaos on Brexit day) has been amended by the House of Lords to back a customs union being agreed with the EU, and also for the UK to join the European Economic Area, which would mean it being a member of the single market, like Norway. MPs are due to vote on these and a series of other Lords amendments which are also at odds with the government's position. Many Labour MPs and peers had hoped Jeremy Corbyn would say the party would vote for staying in the European Economic Area. But Labour has now said it will not support that amendment, instead setting out compromise plans for \"full access\" to the single market.

The argument centers around the white man's dreadlocks and whether he is appropriating black culture. 2. The man is later identified as Cory Goldstein, a student at San Francisco State University, and during the argument, he declares, \"You have no right to tell me what I can wear.\" 3. Most of those commenting on the video agree that the man is right to keep his dreadlocks, and many criticize the black woman in the video. 4. Goldstein later makes a distinction between \"appreciation\" and \"appropriation,\" stating that wearing Native American headdresses is cultural appropriation because only people with high standing in the Native American community have traditionally been given the right to wear them. 5. The woman in the video has apparently shut down her social media accounts and did not respond to requests for comments, and Goldstein later says that his dreadlocks do not mean he is appropriating black culture, and that they bring people closer together.","191":"The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) has called for access arrangements to be gathered by English and Welsh exam boards, to help identify any discrepancies between schools and colleges and provide a more level playing field. JCQ's executive director, Ian Bauckham, says that if one group is getting more access arrangements than another, then something needs to be done to correct that. He says that if this data is not gathered, then it is unlikely that discrepancies between schools and colleges will be identified. He also says that if this data is not gathered, then it is unlikely that any changes to exams will take place. Bauckham says that this data is important because it allows exam boards to identify any discrepancies between schools and colleges, and to correct any problems that may arise.

The number was three million fewer than in the previous quarter, which is 188 million daily active users (DAU). The app's popularity is in the ascendancy, despite the fact that people have stopped using it or never used it before. The app's redesign was implemented and this is what caused people to stop using the app or never used it before. In fact, Snapchat's chief executive, Evan Spiegel, was excited and optimistic about the future. However, Snapchat's chief financial officer, Tim Stone, noted that DAU growth rates had been historically down in quarter three, which is the one that Snapchat is currently experiencing, but he didn't want to give any DAU guidance. The main focus was on two other trends, and Snapchat's redesign is one of the main reasons people stopped using the app or never used it before.","193":"Brian Keenan was kidnapped in 1986 and held captive for 4 1\/2 years by Islamic Jihad.

The House of Lords will debate a motion to suspend Lord Lester on Thursday. The 82-year-old peer described the allegations as completely untrue. However, the Lords Standards Commissioner upheld the complaint which is judged on the balance of probabilities and was based on the strong and cogent evidence of the complainant and her witnesses. The committee also found that Lord Lester had admitted telling another peer the name of the complainant and that she had been responsible for him being suspended by his party which was a breach of confidentiality rules. A separate report by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct, which looks at appropriate sanctions, recommended he should be expelled from the House of Lords, saying the allegations taken together constituted a grave abuse of power. After an appeal by Lord Lester, the committee agreed with the commissioner's verdict but changed the sub-committee's recommended sanction from expulsion to suspension. In his statement, Lord Lester said that he produced evidence which clearly demonstrated that what he was said to have done 12 years ago did not happen and that he regrets the committee's conclusions in the light of these materials. He also called for reform of the procedure for investigating such allegations.","195":"1. The company that had been in years of losing, reported profits this year because of restructuring charges. 2.

Coronavirus vaccines are effective in preventing severe illness and death, but they are not 100% perfect and need to work particularly hard during fast-growing epidemics. Although India has fully vaccinated only 3% of its 1.3 billion people, breakthrough cases seem to be rising, with health workers bearing the brunt of infections so far. Pallava Bagla, 58, was admitted to hospital eight days after his first symptoms, and his blood sugar soared due to his underlying condition, diabetes. Mr Bagla was shown a scan of his lungs and compared to a scan of an unvaccinated, diabetic, male Covid-19 patient of his age, and doctors told him that if he had not been vaccinated, he would have been in critical care. Scientists are trying to find answers to the question of whether our existing vaccines are protecting us enough from newer variants of the coronavirus by taking swabs from Mr Bagla's nose and throat to crack the genetic code of the virus that infected him. Coronavirus vaccines are effective in preventing severe illness and death, but they are not 100% perfect, and they need to work particularly hard during fast-growing epidemics.

However, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Angela Eagle, says that this report exposes the myth that George Osborne had no choice but to cut the deficit at this speed and scale. In conclusion, the IFS report is broadly supportive of the government's plans, but with gloomy caveats.","216":"His company, Pierfront Properties, will redevelop the former Belgravia Hotel in Christchurch Road, Bournemouth. The former hotel has been used as accommodation for homeless people since 1988. In January, Pierfront Properties applied to convert it into 14 flats and to replace a coach house with five houses, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Two previous applications to demolish the hotel building were refused. The majority of objections to the plans were from people living in the building, including Edward Hyde who told BCP it would exacerbate the homeless situation and put the welfare of residents at risk. He said: \"I am pleading with yourselves to refuse the planning of our homes to give us continuing support for people who are the most vulnerable in our society.\" Another occupant, Christopher Whitely, told the council he and others in the building had been issued eviction notices for 27 September, and added: \"All residents are in complete limbo for their futures.\" Karen Hunt, who oversaw the homeless accommodation, had urged Pierfront to withdraw the plans, saying the lives of people living there had been transformed. Mr Hubbard said: \"Sympathy is extended to occupants in this respect but it is understood that the sublease for the existing HMO has already been revoked and this does not have significant bearing on planning considerations.\"","217":"1. The BMI Baby airline has announced that it will stop flying to Belfast International Airport in June 2022. This is a shocking decision that could affect many summer holiday travel plans. The airline was taken over by British Airways' parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), in April 2022, and BMI Baby was expected to leave Belfast airport after summer 2022. However, the airline's decision to stop flying in June 2022 was made last month, and IAG is providing full refunds to passengers who had booked flights after that date. The decision was made in the face of heavy losses, and Brian Ambrose, commercial director of Belfast International Airport, said he suspected the airline would pull out after summer 2022, but was surprised by the announcement. The airport will make an announcement in one week about whether they will be able to find a replacement airline to start flying to Belfast in June 2022 or if there will be a gap in services. The BMI Baby airline was bought by British Airways in 2022 and has been facing financial difficulties since then. This has led to the decision to stop flying to Belfast International Airport in June 2022, which is disappointing for many travelers who had booked flights with the airline.\n2. The decision by BMI Baby to stop flying to Belfast International Airport is causing confusion and distress for many travelers who had booked flights after June 2022. The airline is not providing refunds to passengers who had booked flights after June 2022, and this is causing additional anxiety and frustration for travelers. The airline's decision to stop flying is also affecting local businesses that rely on air travel, and this could have a significant economic impact on the area. The Belfast International Airport is working to find a replacement airline to start flying to Belfast in June 2022, but it is unclear whether this will be possible. Passengers who had booked flights with BMI Baby after June 2022 are concerned about the additional cost and time required to book flights with alternative airlines, and this is causing additional stress and uncertainty for many travelers.

The German carmaker is resisting settling with its domestic customers, claiming that there is no damage and therefore no cause for complaint. This trial is likely to last years, and while settling is unlikely to be a quick solution, the court would support such an effort. The lawsuit is a landmark one, and in terms of the sheer number of claimants, it's certainly attention grabbing. However, it may not be the biggest concern for Volkswagen right now, as the legal process is likely to take years and they expect it to take at least four. Even if they win, they could face a lengthy and expensive legal battle that could drag on for years to come.","219":"Mr. Motivator, a black celebrity from Leicester, England, spoke about the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man killed by a white police officer, and recalled an early experience with racism.\n\nKey points summarized:\n\n-Mr. Motivator, a black celebrity from Leicester, England, spoke about the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man killed by a white police officer, and recalled an early experience with racism.\n\n-In an interview, Mr. Motivator said he was 10 years old when he moved to Leicester from Jamaica and got a job at a knitwear company.\n\n-When he arrived for the interview, he was asked why he hadn't told the company he was black.\n\n-Mr. Motivator said he didn't understand why he was asked this, and pointed out that the interviewer hadn't mentioned he was white.\n\n-Mr. Motivator said this was one of his earliest experiences with racism, and recalled further experiences with racism during his early days in Leicester.\n\n-Mr. Motivator said he later moved to London, where he experienced more racism.\n\n-Mr. Motivator said he was pleased to see many black celebrities speaking out about racism, and said he hoped the protests could lead to positive change.\n\n-Mr. Motivator said he hoped racism could be eliminated, and hoped that society could become more inclusive and diverse.\n\n-Mr. Motivator said he hoped that society could become more inclusive and diverse, and hoped that racism could be eliminated.","220":"1.

In the UK, police only test for drugs if they suspect alcohol consumption and then require drivers to perform a field impairment test or walk in a straight line and count to 30. This type of testing was introduced in 2003, and since then more than 9,000 motorists have been convicted of drug driving in France. According to campaigner Michaela Groves, drivers who test positive for drug use should be subject to the same penalties as drink drivers. In the UK, police are not allowed to test for drugs at the roadside, and campaigners believe this is because they have not taken drug-impaired driving seriously enough. A police spokesperson in Dunkirk, France, said that drug-impaired drivers had a similar effect to drink drivers and that more drug tests should be conducted in the UK to make sure that drivers are not putting other people's lives in danger.","222":"By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent In jumping out of a balloon 128,100ft (24 miles; 39km) above New Mexico, the 43-year-old also smashed the record for the highest ever freefall. He said he almost aborted the dive because his helmet visor fogged up. It took just under 10 minutes for him to descend. Only the last few thousand feet were negotiated by parachute. Once down, he fell to his knees and raised his fists in triumph. Helicopter recovery teams were on hand moments later. \u201cLet me tell you - when I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble.

Its representative was the first to greet the skydiver on the ground. GPS data recorded on to a microcard in the Austrian's chest pack will form the basis for the height and speed claims that are made. These will be submitted formally through the Aerosport Club of Austria for certification. There was concern early in the dive that Baumgartner was in trouble. He was supposed to get himself into a delta position - head down, arms swept back - as soon as possible after leaving his capsule. But the video showed him tumbling over and over. Eventually, however, he was able to use his great experience, from more than 2,500 career dives, to correct his fall and get into a stable configuration. Even before this drama, it was thought the mission might have to be called off. As he went through last-minute checks inside the capsule, it was found that a heater for his visor was not working. This meant the visor fogged up as he exhaled. \u201cThis is very serious, Joe,\u201d he told retired US Air Force Col Joe Kittinger, whose records he was attempting to break, and who was acting as his radio link in mis","223":"a.

The words to the song are \"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\" and the show should have bought the rights to the lyrics. According to the lawsuit, the show used the words on at least eight episodes, since March 2008. CBS was sued for copyright violation in 2015 but a New York district judge has now dismissed the case. In the show, one of the characters says that his mother used to sing the song to him when he was sick. The song has been featured on Big Bang Theory merchandise, from T-shirts to fridge magnets. According to the lawsuit, the show's producers sought permission in 2007 to use the lyrics from Willis Music Co - a Kentucky-based company that had published them in a book called Songs for the Nursery School. However, the lawsuit claims that Willis Music gave permission to use the lyrics without consulting Mrs Newlin's heirs, even though the book makes clear that Mrs Newlin was the author and owned the copyright to the lyrics.","229":"(1) Ceara Thacker was found dead in her halls of residence at the University of Liverpool in May 2018, after suffering mental health problems since she was 13.\n(2) The university's senior mental health adviser admitted that it was more than a month before Ms Thacker's self-referral was processed, and that it was a further month before she had a face-to-face conversation with the first-year student, despite confessing that she had taken an overdose.\n(3) The inquest heard that Ms Pendleton did not consider Ms Thacker to be at immediate risk, and that she had intended to contact the student's GP but failed to do so, and did not discuss telling Ms Thacker's family about her previous suicide attempt.\n(4) Mr Thacker, Ms Thacker's father, has criticised the university for not telling the family about the previous suicide attempt.","230":"George Ferguson said the idea was not about \"closing roads but opening them to people\" and said he hoped to see \"entrepreneurial activity\". The scheme was originally due to run weekly but will run once a month due to operating costs of \u00a3195,000. Baldwin Street, King Street and all roads in the Old City will be closed during car-free Sundays. Mr Ferguson said five days were planned this summer, with the first on 23 June. The \u00a3195,000 cost covers all five days. 'Suck it and see' He said he had been inspired by similar schemes in Bordeaux in France and Bogota in Colombia. \"I'm very keen on taking a 'suck it and see' approach and this is why we're starting on a monthly basis - if it's a success we'll move it into a weekly basis,\" Mr Ferguson said. \"I want people to feel their way and see how they to respond to it. \"It will have some costs in the early stages while we set it up, but in time I hope it becomes a natural thing with a very low cost.\" He added the money would pay for marshalling the road closures and also to provide some of the entertainment. Blue badge spaces People will still be able to drive in to the city as there will be routes to the main car parks, Mr Ferguson said. He also said there would also be provision for disabled drivers and public transport would be largely unaffected. \"I don't think you can close it [the city centre] off completely but I think we can make a large amount of it pedestrian or certainly mixed use,\" Mr Ferguson said. Nick Licata who owns the Brigstow Cafe on Clare Street said he preferred the monthly plan to the original weekly idea. He said: \"I think if it remains as a Sunday special thing, if it remains once a month - then it will work. \"But we don't want this leading into a long term plan of banning cars from the city centre.\"","231":"By Nick HighamBBC News After the fury with which St James's Palace condemned the publication, the move was inevitable. But it is not unprecedented. On several occasions in the last 30 years, the Palace has taken legal action against newspapers or action to prevent personal information being published. Only once has a case actually come to trial. On every other occasion the Palace has accepted an out-of-court settlement. The case that came to court involved Princess Margaret's son, Viscount Linley - coincidentally the owner of the French chateau at which William and Kate were staying when they were photographed this summer. In 1990, he sued the now-defunct newspaper Today for libel after it accused him of rowdy behaviour in a pub: He won \u00a330,000 damages. The Queen has twice sued the Sun for breach of copyright. The first time was in 1988, when relations between the royals and the tabloids were particularly bad. The paper reached an out-of-court settlement after publishing a stolen photograph showing Sarah, Duchess of York and her daughter, Princess Beatrice, which the royal family had planned to use on their Christmas card that year. The second time was in 1993 - when royal-tabloid relations were just as bad - when the paper paid \u00a3200,000 to charity in an out-of-court settlement after publishing a leaked text of the Queen's Christmas broadcast. That same year Princess Diana started legal action against the Daily Mirror when it published photographs taken with a hidden camera of her exercising in a gym. The paper apologised and reportedly paid Diana's legal costs of \u00a31m plus a further \u00a3200,000 to charity. But the gym owner refused to settle, caving in only in February 1995, a week before the case was due to start. He apologised and gave up the \u00a3300,000 he had made from selling the pictures.

The Nationals argued that the SEPP went too far by placing onerous conditions on property owners about how they managed their land, and that it was a way to sanitize the regions and attack property rights, and that koalas could be doubled in numbers if they were protected well, while the Liberal Party argued that the measures were necessary and supported by the community, and that they were aimed at saving koalas.\n3. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, argued that the Nationals were blowing up the NSW government because they want rogue landholders to be able to kill more koalas, and that conservationists argued that the current policy did not do enough to protect the animals.\n4.

The incident occurred in a local video hall, which is a popular place in northern Nigeria where people watch football matches or movies, paying a small fee to do so. The article mentions that Boko Haram, a radical Islamist group, is accused of perpetrating the attack and that there was no immediate statement from the group confirming this. The article also talks about other recent incidents in Nigeria, including a bomb blast in Konduga in July 2018 and armed attacks in Zamfara state, and expresses concerns over security challenges in Nigeria. The author mentions that more than 27,000 lives have been lost in the Boko Haram insurgency and that over 2 million people have been forced to flee their homes in Nigeria in connection to Boko Haram and other security challenges in Nigeria, including armed attacks in Zamfara state. The author adds that Boko Haram insurgency is a decade-old conflict and that concerns remain over security challenges in Nigeria, despite government initiatives to combat insurgency and armed attacks in other parts of the country. The author acknowledges that security challenges in Nigeria remain daunting and complex, and that more needs to be done to improve security and protect people's lives and properties in Nigeria. The article then concludes by expressing hope that the government and people of Nigeria will work together to address the security challenges in Nigeria and improve security in Nigeria.","238":"This is an example of an effective summary because it includes relevant information and is well-written.

The cabinet of Shropshire Council was urged to support the measures north of Shrewsbury amid fears over rising river levels. 2. The proposals included a \u00a3100m scheme that included an embankment in the north west relief road plans. 3. The project, which secured more than \u00a370m of funding, could see a \"water-retaining\" embankment included in the plans for the relief road, reducing the risk for communities along the River Severn, south of Shrewsbury. 4. The authority's director of place Mark Barrow said both proposals needed detailed work to \"assess their suitability\". 5. The county has received claims for flood-related grants from 438 homes and 418 businesses, and the report revealed that during the floods' peak its customer service centre averaged 23,000 calls a day, instead of its usual volume of about 2,500. 6. With river levels estimated to rise by 85cm by 2050, the report called for action, and Mr Barrow said that relying on the measures currently in place and taking an ad-hoc localised approach to river defences was not sustainable. 7.

The plan is expected to focus on reopening schools, and ministers hope to reopen pubs, restaurants, and the tourism industry, although scientists advise against a hasty return to normalcy. The government is reportedly considering allowing people to go on summer holidays in the UK and abroad, and the decision is expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Foreign Office minister James Cleverly says that while the government wants to open schools, pubs, and businesses, it cannot give guarantees because viruses do not work that way. He says that the prime minister will set out his plan to ease lockdown in as much detail as possible, and that while they want to reopen society, they want to do so only if it is safe to do so.","244":"The Belfast city council is set to install six memorials, including one honoring Winifred Carney, a prominent female politician in Ireland. The memorials are part of a plan to increase representation and create a more inclusive city. However, Sinn F\u00e9in councillors opposed the plan, claiming that it did not include a permanent tribute to Winifred Carney, a suffragette and trade unionist. Sinn F\u00e9in leader Ciar\u00e1n Beattie argued that the days of republicans being excluded from City Hall are over and that legal opinions on the plan are needed. The DUP's Lee Reynolds, in contrast, praised the plan as balanced and fair. The Alliance Party's Michael Long agreed, stating that this is a deal that is good for everyone in Belfast. The plan calls for six statues to be installed at City Hall, with Inez McCormack and Paddy Devlin's installations being permanent, and four others being temporary bench statues. The installations of Winifred Carney and Robert MacAdam will be time-limited, and three other memorials, including the first female Lord Mayor of Belfast, Grace Bannister, and Mary Ann McCracken, a prominent female politician, will be temporary. The plan also includes a memorial to Winifred Carney and her husband, George McBride, a Somme veteran and unionist. The city council is working to create a more inclusive and diverse city with more memorials to women and nationalists.\n\n### Other Topics:\n\n- The Difference in Human and Animal Brains\nDescription: Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences....\n1 page\/\u2248275 words| 2 Sources | Chicago | 6th Grade | 2 Hours\n- The Difference in Human and Animal Brains\nDescription: Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences....\n2 pages\/\u2248550 words| 2 Sources | Chicago | 6th Grade | 2 Hours\n- The Difference in Human and Animal Brains\nDescription: Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences....\n2 pages\/\u2248550 words| 2 Sources | Chicago | 6th Grade | 2 Hours","245":"1.

The trial has been agreed after \"extensive preparation\" and assessment of the risk of bare legs being cut on broken glass, one council said. A few UK councils already allow shorts, and three Cambridgeshire-based councils are joining in, including South Cambridgeshire, Cambridge City, and Huntingdonshire, which started the trial Monday. Refuse loaders from South Cambridgeshire, Cambridge City, and Huntingdonshire districts donned their shorts for the first time, and will be allowed to wear shorts until October.

The trial will be carefully monitored and the \"risk of wearing shorts while emptying bins has been evaluated as part of this process\", he added, and he urged residents to keep glass in their recycling bins only and not in additional clear sacks. The spokesman was aware of two other councils in the Midlands and one in Wales and one in Scotland that currently allow refuse workers to wear shorts. In 2005, binmen in Dunfermline threatened industrial action after they were told they could not wear shorts in hot weather.","248":"\"Key Points\"\n\n- The car was a Jaguar right-hand drive coupe that was produced in Coventry in 1961 and was bought by an anonymous buyer from the south of England.\n- The car was auctioned off by Coys auction house in Ascot, England, and was estimated to be worth between \u00a320,000 and \u00a340,000, but could go for up to \u00a3100,000.\n- The car was found in a \"dusty, derelict\" farm in Le Mans, France, and was in need of some restoration but was mostly in good condition.\n- The car was purchased by an individual for their own private collection, but Coys auction house was not sure if they would restore it or not.\n- Coys auction house had international interest in the Jaguar and it was sold for \u00a388,040.","249":"1.

The HSE also confirmed that Colposcopy clinics, which receive notifications of abnormalities, are experiencing an increase in demand. Additional capacity The HSE said that they are \"regret\" that they are currently experiencing significant delays in the reporting of cervical smear test results. The programme has operated for many years with a reporting time of between four and six weeks for cervical screening.

Five - these two men and three previous protesters - have self-immolated in the last 10 days alone, say campaigners, in what appears to be an escalation of Tibetan protests inside China. An unconfirmed report says one Tibetan was beaten to death. \"Batons spiked with nails\" Twenty-year-old Lungtok and 21-year-old Tashi \"set themselves on fire inside a prayer-wheel hut near Kirti Monastery in Ngaba Town\", reported campaign group Free Tibet, using the Tibetan name for the town which China refers to as Aba. \"Once they were in flames, [they] came out of the hut and walked towards the street now known as Martyrs' Street,\" overtly linking their action to the protests of previous self-immolators, it said. Chinese paramilitary police quickly moved in with extinguishers, local sources said, and whisked away the two men. Free Tibet said Lungtok died and Tashi's condition was unknown. Multiple reports suggest that following the self-immolations Tibetans began to demonstrate and their numbers quickly increased. \"Eyewitnesses report that some demonstrators were beaten with metal batons spiked with nails and that some people were dragged away,\" said Free Tibet.

The Campaign to End Loneliness is a group set up by charities and local authorities to tackle this issue. The study found that loneliness is linked to poorer physical and mental health, increased use of GPs, hospitals, and social services. For a decade of an older person's life, the extra economic cost of loneliness is calculated as \u00a36,000. Over five years, preventing loneliness could see a saving of \u00a33.6m.

But Labour has condemned the decision to allow the jury to hear details about the sexual history of the complainant. Attorney General Jeremy Wright told the Commons it was not \"routinely used\" in such cases, but there was \"a concern\". Mr Wright made the comment on Thursday when questioned by Labour's legal affairs spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds. In 2012, Mr Evans was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, the previous year. He served half of a five-year prison term. But that conviction was quashed on appeal last April and he was found not guilty of the same charge at the subsequent retrial. Mr Wright said: \"We need to understand more about the decision in this particular case, we need to understand whether a change in the law is appropriate.\" He said, if a change was not appropriate, the government should look at the guidance given to judges about when evidence is admissible and the instructions judges give to jurors about how it should be used. \"I think we need to do all those things before we're in a position to understand what, if any, changes are needed,\" he added. During the retrial, the jury heard evidence from two men who had intimate relationships with the complainant around the time of the alleged offence of which Mr Evans was accused. Both described \"sexual behaviour\" similar to that Mr Evans said he had observed during his encounter with her. The decision to allow the details before the jury was heavily criticised by some, including blogger Jean Hatchet who said it was \"callous and cruel\". It was also criticised by former solicitor general Vera Baird QC. After the conclusion of the trial, BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said defence lawyers are usually barred from cross-examining an alleged victim about their sexual behaviour or history to protect them from \"humiliating treatment\". But there can be exceptions, he said, in \"sometimes extraordinary\" cases. Mr Evans's lawyer, Simon Waley, told the jury that the prosecution was \"an attack on a man's reputation\". He said Mr Evans, 29, was the \"victim of a very sophisticated and calculated attack by a young woman\".","263":"In this article, the author discusses the psychoanalytical concepts and their impact on the music industry. Dr Stein, a professor of analytical psychology, created a primer for students and trainee psychoanalysts called Jung's Map Of The Soul. His course became a book, which is now recognized as one of the best introductions to the concepts of analytical psychology.\n\nIn recent months, a Japanese student informed Dr Stein that BTS, a South Korean pop phenomena, was recommending his book on their website. The student also informed Dr Stein that the band was coming out with a new album titled Map Of The Soul: Persona. Dr Stein was \"floored\" by this revelation, as the album title and lyrics delved into Jungian concepts of the psyche, ego, and collective unconscious, with a particular focus on the idea of Persona.\n\nPersona is a Latin word for the masks that actors wore on the stage. According to Dr Stein, persona is a reference to the theatre and is part of being a social animal. He goes on to explain that our need to get along with other people, be polite, and be part of a group is reflected in our need to put on masks in public. In some cultures, such as Korean and Japanese cultures, persona is an extremely important part of their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, Dr Stein's primer on Jungian concepts has had a significant impact on the music industry. The popularity of BTS's album Map Of The Soul: Persona is a testament to the relevance of these concepts in our daily lives.","264":"According to the article, standards of reading and writing among many 11-year-olds fell \"stubbornly short\" of achievable levels. One in five is not at the level expected for English at age 11. Rigorous teaching of phonics, which focuses on the sounds of letters and letter combinations, could help all pupils, of any background, said Christine Gilbert, Head of Ofsted.\n\nMs Gilbert said: \"Despite some major initiatives in recent years to raise standards in reading and writing, the levels achieved by many children at the end of primary school fall stubbornly short of what is achievable.\"\n\nThe literacy levels of England's 11-year-olds are measured by the national tests - or Sats - and are published in the primary school league tables. Last year 80% of pupils achieved the grade for English the government expects them to (Level 4), with girls (85%) outshining boys (75%). Reading levels are higher, with 86% making the grade, while in writing only 68% do so.\n\nPupils are also assessed by their teachers at the age of six or seven in reading, writing, maths and science. The latest data on those Key Stage 1 assessments - published last Thursday - showed that nearly 85% of pupils were reading at the expected level (Level 2), with girls doing better than boys. Overall, there was a slight rise in reading and writing levels on last year's results.\n\nOfsted has published a report which looks at how 12 top-rated schools teach children to read and write and hopes it will be a guide to the best practice in teaching phonics. Ms Gilbert said the schools represented a wide range of communities but shared some key similarities - they all had high expectations of all children and taught pupils to read using phonics. \"They are passionate in their belief that every child can learn to read,\" she said. \"Teaching children to read is at the heart of their curriculum. Rigorous, intensive and systematic phonics teaching underpins reading, spelling and writing.","265":"Mr Anwar Ibrahim is a 71-year-old politician who won a by-election in the town of Port Dickson on Saturday, 3 years after he was jailed for sodomy. The king granted him a full pardon in May, and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who is 93, has promised to hand over power to him in two years' time. The pair shocked many by joining forces to oust the previous ruling coalition in May's general election. According to the Election Commission, Mr Anwar received 71% of Saturday's votes from Port Dickson, where a member of the current coalition stepped down to allow for his accession. Dr Mahathir's election win, at the head of the then-opposition party Pakatan Harapan, ended more than six decades of rule by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. Both he and Mr Anwar were formerly in power, as part of the BN, as PM and deputy respectively. Mr Anwar was seen as Dr Mahathir's heir apparent but the relationship soured when Mr Anwar was sacked in 1998 after a leadership dispute, and then jailed on corruption and sodomy charges, widely regarded as politically motivated. In 2004, his sodomy conviction was overturned and he led the opposition to unprecedented gains - though remained short of victory - in the 2008 and 2013 general elections. But that acquittal was itself overturned a year later - as he was preparing to fight a state election he seemed likely to win - and he was sent back to jail to finish his nine-year term. Mr Anwar has since insisted he holds no malice towards his former mentor, who secured his royal pardon.","266":"The new cut will be done by the film's original director Zack Snyder, who left the production of the film before it was finished due to a family tragedy. Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers, was brought in to complete the film, but fans complained he made the film too light-hearted. HBO's announcement comes a week before the release its new streaming service. Warner Media, which produced Justice League, is also the parent company of HBO. Competition among streaming services has heated up over the last year as more companies have entered the field. Announcing content with Hollywood A-listers or with popular franchise like the DC Comics or Star Wars has been one way that services have tried to attract subscribers. \"These brands come with built in fan bases so there will be eyes on the streaming service based on the brand recognition,\" said Vince Peters, chief executive officer of Inheritance AI. A darker Justice League Many fans have been calling for a \"Snyder-cut\" of Justice League since the film was released in 2017. Synder completed most the filming for the movie based on the DC Comic Book. But he stepped away from the project before post-production and editing work following the suicide of his daughter. Whedon, who created the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, did several reshoots and fans suggested he gave the film a lighter tone than Synder's original intent. On social media, the hashtag #ReleasetheSnyderCut has been used by fans calling for a new version of the film. It is not yet known whether the new version, set to be released in 2021 will be a six-part series or a nearly four-hour long directors-cut film. Streaming competition HBO Max is not the only service looking to big names or familiar franchise to attract subscribers. Earlier this week Apple TV Plus announced it would premier the Tom Hanks' film Greyhound, developed by Sony Pictures. The film was set to have a theatrical release in June, but executives changed course because of concern the coronavirus pandemic could impact ticket sales.","267":"A man who forced four British men to work in squalid conditions in exchange for accommodation and leftover takeaway food was jailed for eight-and-a-half years in June 2018. His assets worth \u00a3133,000, including two houses and a large amount of cash, were seized.

It also highlights a tense relationship between Kitchener and Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill had 10 million rounds at his disposal but rejected the request with a reply of \"No, no, no, no...\" The exchange was found by military genealogy website Forces War Records in the National Archives at Kew. Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener was overseeing the British Expeditionary Force being overwhelmed by the German army in Belgium at the time. British and Belgian forces were trying to delay the Germans from breaking into France. But as they were pushed back to Antwerp, Kitchener - famed for featuring on WW1 recruitment posters with the slogan \"Your Country Needs You\" - wrote to the future prime minister on 27 August requesting help. \"My dear Churchill. As we are keeping Antwerp going with ammunition, please give any you can spare from your ships to us,\" he wrote in the letter from the War Office. \"I think you said 10 million rounds would be available. It makes me shudder to think of troops without ammunition.\" \"May I send an officer to the Admiralty to talk to your people about this and take over your contribution to Antwerp?\" Churchill, appointed to his post in Asquith's government in 1911, wrote a reply in red ink on the bottom of the letter for his secretary to write up. \"No, no, no, no. 10,000,000 rounds is all I have got for the fleet. I have already given 500,000 rounds,\" he said. \"I will see if anything can be scraped up from the ships to enable me to dispense with the 2,000,000 rounds we were counting on from you!\" Forces War Records suggests Churchill may have let his dislike for Kitchener influence his sentiments but says the actual letter his secretary sent to Kitchener would been \"more subtle\". Tim Hayhoe, from Forces War Records, said: \"The letter was written during the very early stages of the war but it shows that the British army was not prepared for war 100 years ago.","269":"Theresa May, the UK prime minister, announced plans to reform the Parole Board after a black cab rapist was released from prison. John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences, including rape, and is suspected of attacking more than 100 women. The Parole Board decided to approve his release with \"stringent\" licence conditions after a hearing in November. The release of Worboys has sparked outrage among victims of sexual violence, who feel \"betrayed\" by the decision. David Lidington, the justice secretary, acknowledged that Worboys' release \"must have reawakened the most appalling memories\" of victims. He said there was a \"strong case\" to review the system in order to make sure that victims have the option to be kept informed about cases. Theresa May said she was determined to do \"what is necessary\" to bring \"greater openness\" to the decision-making process of the Parole Board. She revealed that she knew one of Worboys' victims and that the victim had not been told that he would be released, but had heard about it through the media. The PM also said that the government wanted to ensure that victims feel confident enough to come forward, so that they feel confident that the police will take action, and confident that they will get justice.","270":"The bereaved have been told they can pay tribute however they wish and are able to use video and audio recordings. A hearing took place in central London to lay out procedures for the inquiry, which begins on 21 May. A fire alert cut short the morning session, but there was no evacuation. An alarm sounded at Holborn Bars in central London at 12:35 GMT saying a fire had been reported and was being investigated, but people were urged to stay where they were. Richard Millet QC, counsel to the inquiry, said it was agreed that survivors and family members should be able to memorialise their loved ones \"calmly and with dignity\" ahead of the oral evidence. \"By starting the public hearings of this inquiry in this way, we can ensure that, however technical and scientific the issues may then become, however dry, however legal, we will never lose sight of who our work is for and why we are doing it,\" he said. The tower block fire in west London killed 71 people last June. Wednesday's hearing also heard that 150 venues were considered before it was decided to hold the inquiry at Holborn Bars. It will be screened at Notting Hill Community Church, close to the Grenfell Tower site, where affected people can watch it together. 'Touched a nerve' Aiasha Mohamed, 16, whose aunt and two cousins died in the fire, told the BBC that representatives at the inquiry should consider speaking in plainer English as she found it difficult for someone her age to follow. She also suggested translators were on hand for those who do not speak English, like her mother, Sayeda. Sayeda, who only speaks Arabic, told the BBC some of the statements were too short and they deserved to hear more. Grenfell Tower resident Nicholas Burton, whose wife died in January, said Wednesday's hearing was like being in the dentist's chair. \"It was when they touched a nerve, you heard the sound go up,\" he told the BBC.

It is known for its famous people such as Alan Partridge and Delia Smith. The surrounding area is also home to the late turkey tycoon Bernard Matthews and Colman's Mustard. It has the largest protected wetland in Britain - the Norfolk Broads. The city is not a popular destination for tourists, but flight operator LinksAir believes it will be a popular route, both for people travelling on business, and for tourists. The airline, which runs the daily Welsh Government subsidised flights from Anglesey to Cardiff, was looking for another destination to fly onto after Cardiff, because the plane was effectively sitting dormant for much of the day between flights to and from Anglesey. Norwich facts Source: Visit Norwich LinksAir looked for a route which was not already offered by Bristol airport. It hit upon Norwich. From April the 19-seater plane which flies from Anglesey to Cardiff will stop briefly in the Welsh capital to pick up and drop off passengers, before going onto Norwich. Later in the afternoon it will take the same route back to Anglesey. The main clientele LinksAir hopes to tap into, are business people connected with the energy industry. The airline's commercial manager Roger Hage said: \"We needed to do a route that was niche. This route is aimed at business as there are a number of employees who work in gas offshore in East Anglia and the Norfolk coast. Energy is very important to Norfolk, and Anglesey has set out its plans as the energy island.\" It is hoped the flights will be popular with these workers as, after Aberdeen Airport, Norfolk has the biggest heliport in the UK serving the offshore industry in oil, gas and windfarms. Nova Fairbank, from the Norfolk Chamber of Commerce, said: \"The East Anglian region has a lot of energy knowledge. It is a base for skills which would be useful to Anglesey if they want to capitalise on moving into energy. \"So there is method in the madness of LinksAir choosing Norwich. It's not just a random choice. It could be the beginning of a long-term relationship between the two regions.\n\nLink to article:\nhttp:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-wales-21","273":"In a shocking turn of events, Scott Marsden, a member of the Marsden's All Styles Kickboxing club in Sheffield, passed away after a fight in Leeds on Saturday.

Specifically, the article examines the loss of 134 million miles of bus coverage over the past decade, which has been attributed to rising car use and cuts to public funding. The article also highlights the impact of this decline on communities, with some communities taking to starting their own services to fill the void left by the loss of public transportation. The article notes that Wales and north-west England have been hardest hit by this decline, and that the government has encouraged councils and bus companies to work together to halt the decline. The article also explores the possibility that buses are on course to be cut to the same extent railways were in the 1960s, and that the loss of miles of coverage is a sign of this potential future. The article quotes Chris Todd of the Campaign for Better Transport as saying that the loss of bus coverage is a sign of the society's willingness to abandon certain groups of people. The article also highlights the impact of the decline on communities, with examples of residents being unable to access basic services such as shops and GP surgeries.

Mr Shelford received 34.4% of first preference votes and was elected after second preference votes were counted. He polled 161,319 first and second preference votes, beating Labour's Kerry Barker who secured 146,293. Mr Shelford said it's very, very exciting but it's also quite humbling and there's a huge responsibility placed on his shoulders. He said that the most important thing is about reassuring the public that the police are there for them and that he is raring to go. Mr Shelford said that there is a \"great opportunity for good communications\" between his office and the government, and that he is looking forward to working with Home Secretary Priti Patel.

The investigation found that EDF Energy had breached some aspects of the licences governing the information it gives when selling to customers. Customers were not always given complete information on matters including contract terms and the way their direct debits or annual consumption was calculated. It also said that telesales agents sometimes made opening statements in their calls to customers that claimed it could offer savings before they knew the actual circumstances of the customer they were calling.\n\nAs a result of the investigation, Ofgem imposed a penalty of \u00a34.5m on EDF Energy, which included a \u00a31 penalty. The penalty was the biggest of its kind. The \u00a34.5m package included a \u00a350 payment to 70,000 of EDF's most vulnerable customers. Ofgem said it had accepted EDF's offer of a package for vulnerable customers in place of a penalty, which would have have gone to the Treasury.\n\nEDF Energy said that it was disappointed that it failed to live up to the high standards that it expects of itself. As soon as the issue was identified, EDF Energy took action to satisfy itself that it was fully compliant.

She added that Consumer Focus was disappointed that the issue had arisen in the first place and that it would be watching EDF Energy's actions closely to ensure that it continues to deliver a good service to its customers.","282":"In a recording posted on his Twitter account, he said: \"Venezuelan brothers and sisters, the moment you hear this message I will be on my way back home.\" He also called on Venezuelans to join anti-government protests planned for Monday and Tuesday. Mr Guaid\u00f3 has called on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to resign. The two men have been at loggerheads for more than a month. While Mr Guaid\u00f3 has been recognised by more than 50 countries, Mr Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Cuba, insists he is the only legitimate president. Why is Mr Guaid\u00f3's return risky? After Mr Guaid\u00f3 proclaimed himself interim president on 23 January, Venezuela's Supreme Court - which is dominated by loyalists of President Maduro - placed a travel ban on the opposition leader. Mr Guaid\u00f3 defied that to attend a fund-raising concert in Colombia on 22 February organised by billionaire Richard Branson. Mr Guaid\u00f3 also led efforts to try to bring humanitarian aid, mainly donated by the US, into Venezuela. The government of Mr Maduro rejected the aid, arguing it was part of a US plot to overthrow him. The president ordered the closure of borders with Colombia and Brazil. Soldiers blocked the aid trucks, leading to clashes that left at least five dead. The Maduro government alleged - without giving any evidence - that the aid was contaminated and carcinogenic. How will he get back in? It is not clear. He had left by secretly sneaking across the Venezuela-Colombia border, reportedly with the help of sympathetic Venezuelan soldiers. Mr Guaid\u00f3 could sneak back over the porous 2,200km (1,370 mile) border on one of the many paths used by smugglers.

The followers of the account joined in, posting their own photos and videos of the cloud. The cloud was described as \"lens-shaped\" and \"sci-fi-like.\"\n\nThe BBC Scotland weather presenter, Judith Ralston, explained that the cloud was a type of lenticular cloud called Altocumulus Lenticularis. These clouds are formed when air currents meet at a certain height, creating a flat, lens-shaped cloud that can be seen from a distance. Ralston added that rain or light snow above the atmosphere can add a rainbow reflection to the cloud, making it even more striking.\n\nOne of the photos taken of the cloud by Trish Macfarlane was particularly striking, with a bright rainbow reflection and a rainbow-colored halo. The photo was shared on Twitter, where it garnered a lot of attention.\n\nOne Twitter user, Althea Tindell, commented on the photo, saying that the images were \"fantastic\" and that the cloud could be mistaken for a UFO. Indeed, the unusual shape of the cloud and the bright colors make it look otherworldly.\n\nLenticular clouds are not uncommon, but they are often mistaken for UFOs because of their strange shape and color. They are actually quite common in mountainous regions and are often seen around volcanoes and in other areas with strong air currents.\n\nIf you're interested in taking photos of lenticular clouds, you'll need to find a location with strong air currents, such as a mountain or a volcano. The cloud will only be visible if the air currents are strong enough to create the lens-shaped cloud. You'll also need to be quick, as lenticular clouds don't last long and can disappear within minutes.\n\nIn conclusion, the article describes an unusual weather phenomenon that took place in Aberdeen, Scotland, where a lenticular cloud with a rainbow reflection was spotted. The cloud was described as \"lens-shaped\" and \"sci-fi-like\" and was shared on Twitter, garnering a lot of attention.

A review, which started in late 2016, examined each health board's arrangements to meet demand for radiology examinations and made recommendations for service improvements.

The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has also claimed more than 4,800 angina patients missed out on life-saving scans last year as Welsh hospitals provided only a fifth of tests needed.

The move comes exactly two months after the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Earlier Tepco said it had found another leak of highly contaminated water into the sea but was able to halt the flow. A Tepco spokesman said workers stopped a leak into a storage pit, which lay outside reactor No 3 and within metres of the ocean. A similar leak at the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactor No 2 was sealed in April with a special chemical known as liquid glass. The plant has been leaking radiation since the 11 March earthquake and subsequent tsunami damaged cooling systems at the six-reactor plant. More than 80,000 local residents living within a 20km (12 mile) radius of the plant have been evacuated from their homes. Agriculture and businesses have been hit and there is no timescale yet for allowing residents to return - Tepco has said that it may take up to nine months to achieve a cold shut-down at the plant. Tepco is seeking a 2 trillion yen ($24.8bn) loan to see it through the initial emergency. It also expects to pay 50 billion yen ($620m) in initial compensation to those evacuated around the plant. Overall damages are unknown but are expected to be much higher. The government is considering establishing a new body to deal with the payments in case they exceed Tepco's ability to pay.

The misconduct panel chair, Alex Lock, said that the allegations would \"undermine trust in the police\" and that dismissal was the only appropriate outcome. The panel said that the officer abused his position as a police officer by revealing his identity and sending the woman a picture of himself in uniform. It was also noted that even one instance of an officer abusing their position for sex was \"a betrayal\". The officer's defence was that he only \"heard what he wanted to hear\" so he could pursue a sexual encounter with the woman, despite knowing that she had previously been raped and was in therapy. However, the panel found that the officer only \"heard what he wanted to hear\" so he could pursue a sexual encounter with the woman.

The defence said that the officer was only seeking a \"non-committal relationship\" and that it was not strange for the pair to want to get to know each other. The defence also said that sending \"short sexts\" while on duty was not the same as \"chipping off\" work to have sex.

The company wants to maximize the capacity in its existing network on the mainland. On Wednesday it was announced that a French-Chinese consortium had dropped its bid to build an \u00a38bn nuclear power station on Anglesey.

The exosphere is extremely thin, with the density of oxygen being five trillion times less than that of Earth's atmosphere. The presence of an exosphere was confirmed by instruments on the Cassini probe, which orbits the ringed planet and its moons. The discovery is reported in the online version of Science magazine. Oxygen exospheres have been seen at Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede, but this is the first time such a detection has been made in the Saturnian system. The researchers say that the tenuous envelope around Rhea is maintained by high-energy particles that constantly bombard the moon's icy surface. As the magnetic field rotates around Saturn, particles carried in the field slam into the hemisphere of Rhea that's facing their flow, breaking water molecules on the surface. The atoms are then rearranging themselves to make O2 molecules, which are sputtered from the surface by additional impacting particles. Some of it, like the O2, could be being produced as a result of high-energy particle impacts. It is possible also that the carbon dioxide was made in deep sub-surface processes and the CO2 is slowly escaping the moon's body. Previous efforts to try to identify an exosphere at Rhea using Earth telescopes and even the remote-sensing instruments on Cassini had failed. Only by getting up close to Rhea could Cassini make a positive detection.\n\nCategories:\n\nTags:","298":"This article provides information about a man who allegedly murdered his wife over a pre-nuptial agreement.

Twin factors Analysts said while Toshiba was looking to increase its presence in the sector, other factors may have also played a part in its decision, not least a strong Japanese currency. The yen has risen 12% against the US dollar in the past 12 months, giving Japanese firms greater purchasing power. That has resulted in Japanese companies going on a buying spree. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Japanese companies did more than 600 such deals in 2011, spending nearly $70bn on them. \"The strong yen is definitely a factor here,\" Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology Japan told the BBC.

Stephen Morgan, who set up an online petition with Labour councillor Yahiya Chowdhury, said that the plans to close the station on Winston Churchill Avenue are a \"grave threat to community policing\". He believes that a city the size of Portsmouth needs a centrally located police station. People want to see police in a police station, not other public buildings. There is a real perception issue if the last police station in the city is lost. This leads to the perception that it is not a safe place to live.\n\nThe Police and Crime Commissioner, Mr Hayes, said that the closure is part of an attempt to modernize the policing estate in Portsmouth.

It is estimated survival rates have improved by 30%. It started at the old Frenchay hospital before moving to the new \u00a3430m Southmead super-hospital four miles away in 2014. A cluster of six other hospitals - including Bristol Royal Infirmary - operate as major trauma units in a network around it. But Southmead, one of 27 MTCs across England, is in line to take the most critical cases first - involving up to 1,500 patients a year. Dr Ben Walton, consultant in intensive care medicine, said it offered a consistency of service which was not possible before. \"The feeling when these centres were first set up in London it would take five years to see improvements - we've seen it in 18 months,\" he said. \"In the past, if a patient was seriously injured in a road traffic collision or fell at home, they'd be taken to the nearest hospital with an emergency unit. \"Now, if they fulfil certain criteria and the assessment of the ambulance or pre-hospital doctor crew is that they're likely to have a serious injury, they will by-pass their nearest emergency department and be transferred directly to the major trauma centre.\" Dr Walton said the major trauma centre could gather together multiple specialists around the clock and deal with injuries which are often complex. \"Patients are met by a trauma team which is 24\/7, 365 days of the year and there will always be a senior clinician - a consultant - leading that team. \"That's of benefit to patients and can't be provided at every hospital, it's impossible.\" There is a flow of patients between the other trauma units and the MTC, depending on the seriousness of their condition and stage of their care. But Dr Walton said: \"I think there's no doubt the rehabilitation of patients in our network is patchy. There's not a joined up, consistent service.\" Major trauma also went beyond road traffic accidents and included the elderly who were more likely to suffer head injuries.

The animal was found swimming in a creek near the coastal town of Bega, and was captured and released into a nearby river mouth by wildlife and council officers. The species was hunted nearly to extinction in the 19th Century but is now thriving in protected breeding grounds. The animal appeared calm as it swam back into the sea, and was likely disoriented and had swum a long way up the creek, according to Andrew Irvine, unit supervisor of marine mammals at Sydney's Taronga Zoo. Seals can remain on land for more than a month and are comfortable out of the water for long periods of time, but can get hot and tired. This is not the first time a fur seal has been found in an unusual location, as another one was found sleeping in a public toilet block in Tasmania earlier this year.

Profits for the six-month period were down 36% from the previous year at \u00a310m. The company warned in October that profits would fall short of expectations due to weak international demand, including a drop in wholesale orders from Asia. Mulberry repeated that its wholesale business was facing a more challenging external environment in Asia, resulting in cautious ordering by franchise partners. However, chief executive Bruno Guillon said that he expected wholesale sales to rebound in the New Year. Retail sales growth was 7% on a like-for-like basis, compared to the 26% growth rate seen in 2011, but had picked up in October and November, reaching 11%. Mulberry also revealed a squeeze in its profit margins, due to the cost of employing higher quality materials and manufacturing techniques for its goods. The company said that it expected its full-year profits to be in line with market expectations. Shares in Mulberry have been on the slide since May and fell by a quarter following its profits warning in October. The company's share price has since recovered, but still remains more than 50% down from its peak.","315":"The offensive began with two suicide car blasts late on Saturday, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. Clashes were also taking place in nearby Sadad, a mostly Christian town. The latest development comes amid air campaigns in Syria by Russia and a US-led coalition. IS has been expanding from its mainly northern and eastern strongholds towards Homs in central Syria in recent months. The group overran the town of Tadmur \u2013 home to the ancient ruins of Palmyra \u2013 in May, and later took al-Qaryatain town in August. The latest offensive on Maheen and Sadad brings IS to within 20km (13 miles) of the main road that links the Syrian capital Damascus to Homs and other cities further north. Christian population The Observatory said at least 50 government soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The attack on Maheen began late on Saturday with twin suicide car bombs, a favoured tactic for IS militants launching an assault. By Sunday morning the Observatory reported that the whole town was reported to be in IS hands. An IS statement also said the group had taken the town. Maheen is home to a large military complex and arms depot. Meanwhile, clashes between government troops and IS are said to be continuing on the outskirts of Sadad. The town is reportedly home to 15,000 people, mostly Syriac Orthodox Christians, and has 14 churches and a monastery. The fighting comes amid continued Russian air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which Russian officials say are targeting IS and other \u201cterrorist groups\u201d. However, activists on the ground say the strikes have been hitting moderate rebels and civilians in western areas, where IS have little or no presence.

NME was launched in 1952 and has featured global superstars on its cover, including David Bowie, Oasis, Dua Lipa, Amy Winehouse, and Sam Smith. The magazine's website launched in 1997 and it became free in September 2015. Fans of the magazine have been reacting to the news on social media, using the hashtag #RIPNME. Time Inc UK's group managing director, Paul Cheal, said the magazine's move to free print helped to propel the brand to its biggest ever audience on NME.com.

New research in Brazil has suggested that babies who are exclusively breastfed for six months go on to score higher on IQ tests as adults. However, the study was not able to conclusively prove that breastfeeding was the sole factor behind this, as there are many other factors that could influence intelligence. Furthermore, experts believe that breastfeeding should still be a choice for mothers, as there are other factors that may impact a baby's development. The research in Brazil traced nearly 3,500 babies, from all walks of life, and found those who had been breastfed for longer went on to score higher on IQ tests as adults. Experts say the results, while not conclusive, appear to back current advice that babies should be exclusively breastfed for six months. But they say mothers should still have a choice about whether or not to do it. Regarding the findings - published in The Lancet Global Health - they stress there are many different factors other than breastfeeding that could have an impact on intelligence, although the researchers did try to rule out the main confounders, such as mother's education, family income and birth weight. Dr Bernardo Lessa Horta, from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, said his study offers a unique insight because in the population he studied, breastfeeding was evenly distributed across social class - not something just practised by the rich and educated. Most of the babies, irrespective of social class, were breastfed - some for less than a month and others for more than a year. Those who were breastfed for longer scored higher on measures of intelligence as adults. They were also more likely to earn a higher wage and to have completed more schooling. Long-term impact Dr Horta believes breast milk may offer an advantage because it is a good source of long-chain saturated fatty acids which are essential for brain development. But experts say the study findings cannot confirm this and that much more research is needed to explore any possible link between breastfeeding and intelligence. Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing, Public Health England, said there was strong evidence that breastfeeding provides some health benefits for babies - reduced respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in infancy, for example.

Nelson was accused of \"cultural appropriation\" and there were calls for her to apologise. The post has also received over 191,000 likes and many positive comments. Among the fierce debate in response to the picture, Instagram poster sophia_mohamed addressed the star directly: \"Jesy, hun, I love you, but please take this down or write an apology. It may have not been thought about at the time, but this is cultural appropriation. \"I'm not hating and you do look beautiful, but this hairstyle isn't meant for you.\" However, another user strongly defended the picture and the right for anyone to wear their hair how they wish. \"If we are practicing equality then we should be free to do what we like and that includes a hairstyle that is typically known to be worn in black culture,\" wrote blessbabe. \"Is it right to tell black people not to dye their hair blonde? No it isn't. Why? Because they can do what they choose.\" Other fans on Twitter have also been showing their support. Nelson is not the first pop star to wear braids and not the first public figure to generate criticism on social media over her hairstyle. Reality TV star and businesswoman Kim Kardashian West provoked controversy in late January when she posted a Snapchat story unveiling what she described as \"Bo Derek braids\". She was accused of cultural appropriation and ignorance for crediting Derek, who wore the hairstyle in the film 10, with braids which originated in Africa.

The area is dominated by ash and without intervention, it could be devastated by the disease, said NE. Joe Alsop, from NE, said planting using drones had not been done on any of its sites in the Peak District before. He said the project will focus on several woodlands and there are plans for about 200,000 trees to be planted. The drone planting trial will be done towards the end of the five-year project, probably in 2024 or 2025. The trees will be wrapped in a small ball of fertilizer and specially-adapted drones will broadcast them on the planting site. NE said the ravine forests of the Peak District have high levels of ash dieback infection and have lost mature trees. Although lime and wych elm trees are being planted in the spaces when ash have died, they won't give up on ash and will find species that might be resilient to the disease. The project has received \u00a33.6m in funding from the EU Life programme, as well as funding from the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, the National Trust and the Chatsworth Estate.","338":"The recent attacks on Saudi oil facilities are being investigated by the United States and senior officials have told media outlets that the locations were in southern Iran, at the northern end of the Gulf. Saudi air defences did not stop the drones and missiles because they were pointed southwards, to prevent attacks from Yemen. Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which disrupted global oil supplies. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attacks, but US officials believe the drones and missiles did not originate from the south or south-west, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the attack a reciprocal act by the \"Yemeni people\". Oil prices soared 20% after the attacks, but have since pared their gains as it appears market disruption will not be as bad as feared. Saudi Arabia's energy minister has said he expects production to be fully back online by the end of the month, adding that half the production at the damaged facilities has already been restored.

However, Water UK, a membership organization that works with water companies on industry standards, is \"not convinced\" and Severn Trent Water has refused the council a \"trade effluent\" permit. The cremation company Resomation says waste water does not contain human DNA. According to the company's website, after the cremation, liquid is \"safely returned to the water cycle free from any traces of DNA\". However, a source at Water UK has expressed \"serious concerns about the public acceptability of this\" and has said that \"it is the liquefied remains of the dead going into the water system. We don't think the public will like the idea.\" The process of \"water cremation\" involves a body being placed in a metal chamber, where it is reduced to liquid and ash using a process known as alkaline hydrolysis. The process, which takes three to four hours, has not yet been used in the UK, although it is operational in a number of US states. Resomation says the process produces a third less greenhouse gas than cremation, needs a seventh of the energy and allows for the complete separation of dental amalgam and bodily implants for safe disposal. Mercury from crematoria is believed to be the cause of 16% of UK airborne mercury emissions. Sandwell Council, in Oldbury, West Midlands, which is working to offer water cremation at Rowley Regis crematorium, said it hoped to \"offer people more choice\". Severn Trent Water said it was looking for government guidance as \"there is no industry standard\". In March it refused the council the trade effluent permit, which relates to what can go into sewers.","342":"1.

Another 200 walk-in testing centres will also open by October.\n5. The success rate for reaching contacts who don't live together peaked at just over 70% in the middle of July, but has fallen since then.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe remaining contact tracers will work alongside local public health teams to reach more infected people and their contacts in communities. It comes after criticism that the national system was not tapping into local knowledge. The approach has been used in virus hotspots like Blackburn and Luton. And it's now being offered to all councils that are responsible for public health in their area. Test and trace is staffed by NHS clinicians and people who were trained to become contact tracers during the pandemic. NHS staff who offer advice to people who have tested positive for coronavirus will not be laid off. But the national service will shrink from 18,000 contact tracers to 12,000 with the remaining non-NHS call handlers redeployed as part of dedicated local test and trace teams, the Department of Health says. This means local areas will have \"ring-fenced teams\" from the national test and trace service. Another 200 walk-in testing centres will also open by October. As part of NHS Test and Trace, public health teams dealing with outbreaks in factories or care homes have consistently reached more than 90% of the contacts on their lists. Outside of those very localised outbreaks, it is call centres who trace contacts. But they don't reach as many contacts - their success rate for reaching contacts who don't live together peaked at just over 70% in the middle of July, but has fallen since then.

The earliest he can formally start the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord is 4 November. The pull-out will take effect a year later - the day after the 2020 US presidential election. The Paris agreement brought together 195 nations in the battle to combat climate change. It committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. President Trump said if he couldn\u2019t improve that deal he\u2019d pull out, but diplomatic sources said there\u2019s been no major effort at renegotiation. A seek-and-destroy mission In the meantime, the president\u2019s staff have conducted what critics call a seek-and-destroy mission through US environmental legislation. Mr Trump promised that he\u2019d turn the US into an energy superpower, and he\u2019s attempting to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He categorised former US President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. The gas and oil industries are indeed thriving, but Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to resurrect the coal industry has proved much more challenging. Coal can't compete on price with gas - or, for that matter, with renewables whose costs have plummeted. Firms are also reluctant to invest billions in coal-fired plants which could have a limited life if the next administration rejoins the rest of the world on climate change. As coal is the dirtiest fuel, the industry\u2019s woes have held down US emissions, despite the President\u2019s policies.

The plane was on its way from London to New York on 21 December when it exploded above Lockerbie.

He was arrested in 1605 after the failed attempt to blow up Parliament and kill King James I. Oldcorne was later executed, despite no evidence linking him to the assassination attempt. The crucifix was found after troops discovered the Jesuit hiding inside a priest hole at Hindlip Hall - a stately home in Worcestershire. It is now on display at the Bar Convent Living Heritage Centre. 'Historic event' Sister Patricia Harriss described the cross housed in a wooden case as \"one of the most remarkable items in our possession.\" \"Today, Bonfire Night is a celebration with fireworks but in 1605 it was an event that had a profound effect on Catholics and shocked the whole country,\" she said. \"This crucifix, now more than 400 years old, was hidden in the priest's hole with Blessed Edward Oldcorne and would have offered him comfort in his final days. \"It is incredible that it has survived and can now be used to tell the story of these men and of this extraordinary historic event that has such strong links to the city of York.\" Father Oldcorne was hung, drawn and quartered in 1606 in a crackdown on the Catholic faith in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot. He was beatified, the first step to becoming a saint, by the Vatican in 1929. The Jesuit priest had attended St Peter's School in York, alongside Fawkes and fellow plotters Christopher and John Wright. The school has a ban on the burning of guys on Bonfire Night after a former headmaster declared that it should not burn effigies of former pupils.","354":"Between 45,000 and 50,000 of the company's post boxes will move to the earlier collections. Royal Mail says there will still be a late posting box within half a mile of areas affected and will add 2,000 post boxes to its 115,000 network. The earlier collections will be picked up by delivery staff as part of their existing rounds. The majority of those switching as part of today's announcement will be in urban and suburban areas, with an indicator tab showing whether a collection has been made. Post men and women empty some 12,000 postboxes in rural areas and many of the new boxes will be targeted at these areas, the company said. Royal Mail said many post boxes no longer cover their costs: \"Rather than decommission uneconomic postboxes, while staying within the regulated density requirement, Royal Mail will ensure their viability by improving the efficiency of its collections arrangements.\" Alternative providers? The regulator, Ofcom, requires Royal Mail to have post boxes within half a mile of 98% of households. In response to the new plans it said: \"Ofcom recognises the need for Royal Mail to become more efficient so it can sustain a universal postal service that consumers value highly.\" \"While the changes won't affect the majority of postal users, Ofcom expects Royal Mail to communicate clearly with any affected consumers and ensure that their reasonable needs continue to be met,\" the statement said. Ofcom reviewed customers' attitude to posting times last year and found that 91% of postal users did not choose a postal box based on collection time. Alexander Jackman, head of policy at the Forum of Private Business said: \"As Royal Mail faces increasing competition, it's understandable that the service needs to be a leaner operation. \"However, as businesses see service levels decline while postage costs continue to rise it is inevitable that many will look for alternative providers if that's an option for them.\"","355":"The United Kingdom and European Union have reached a deal on their future trade relations, resolving months of disagreements over fishing rights and future business rules. First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed the deal and urged both sides to achieve a deal. The agreement was also welcomed by the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and the SDLP. However, it is important to note that the deal will not undo the damage of Brexit and will not fully mitigate the damage that leaving the European Union will have on people, businesses and communities in Northern Ireland.

Ivabradine is already available in the UK to treat angina. Prof Martin Cowie, who led the UK-based part of the study, said it could save up to 10,000 lives each year.\n2. The trial involved more than 6,500 people in 37 countries who already used standard treatments such as beta-blocker drugs. Over a typical study period of two years, ivabradine cut the risk of death from heart failure by 26%.\n3. The research findings were presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual meeting in Stockholm.\n4. Heart failure occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body.\n5. Heart failure uses up 1% to 2% of the total NHS budget and direct medical costs alone amounting to \u00a3625m each year.\n6. Unlike other treatments, such as beta-blockers, ivabradine lowers the number of heartbeats per minute without also reducing blood pressure.\n7. 'Clinical breakthrough' Prof Cowie, a consultant cardiologist at London's Royal Brompton Hospital, described as conservative estimates that 10,000 deaths could be prevented in the UK by prescribing the drug to eligible patients.\n8. One in four people in the UK could develop heart failure in some point in their lives.\n9. The drug works by slowing the pulse down so that it helps to take some of the strain off the heart.\n10. In the past we have been able to do that with drugs called beta blockers but many patients can't take beta blockers because they have asthma or it drops their blood pressure.\n11. This drug has the advantage that it can be added to beta blockers or it can be given to patients who can't take beta blockers.\n12. The drug is a pill taken once a day.","357":"1.

There are legitimate business reasons to volunteer for a smaller pay packet, even if you are not a senior executive.\n\nIn the second paragraph, the author mentions that Mr. Pennycook said that long days and weekends working away from his family at the office last year had justified his \u00a33.6m total take-home pay in 2015.

Police used water cannon to disperse demonstrators and there have been scuffles as officers tried to clear small tented camps set up by protestors. Last night, a Porsche garage was torched. On Thursday night a huge demonstration is planned. On Friday, protesters aim to stop world leaders getting into the summit. At Hamburg's police headquarters, there is an atmosphere of nervous tension. Teams of officers in minibuses drive in and out past lines of water cannon and police vans, parked up and ready for action. About 20,000 officers are on duty over the course of G20. The police, it seems, are taking no chances. They say up to 8,000 extremists, armed with home-made weapons, are targeting the city. \"Some of these militants will be very aggressive,\" said Ralf Martin Meyer, the chief of Hamburg police. \"In the last few days we've seized improvised weapons like slingshots, ball bearings and fire extinguishers filled with flammable liquid which were intended for use against police officers. \"The amount of tools and weapons we found make us very concerned.\" The police operation has divided opinion in Germany. Too many officers, too heavy handed, say those worried that the decision to seal off part of the city centre and keep protesters out is an infringement of Germans' right to peaceful protest. As mounted units patrol the area around the summit hall and workers in orange overalls use forklift trucks to place concrete blocks along the pavement, many question the wisdom of holding an event like this in a congested city centre.

The allegation against Mr. Jones was that he had broken the code by accepting a job as a global advisory board member of GFG Alliance, the parent company of Liberty Steel. The body said there was a risk that such insight would give GFG Alliance an unfair commercial advantage. In October, the chair of ACoBA, Lord Eric Pickles, wrote to Mr. Jones, saying that joining the GFG Alliance global advisory board was contrary to the advice of the committee and that as a result he was in breach of the government's business appointment rules. Mr. Drakeford said in his response that Mr. Jones had been careful to refer to the committee any appointments that he was considering taking up, as required by the ministerial code, and had responded positively to the committee's advice.

The first minister, Carwyn Jones, however, said that he is confident that the new literacy and numeracy programmes will improve the situation. The report also notes that 20% of children start secondary school with a reading age below nine years and six months, which is generally considered the level of functional literacy.\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones has called this statistic a \u201cdamning indictment\u201d of the Welsh government, as it has been in power for 12 years. The Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, Kirsty Williams, has also criticised the report, saying that Estyn has repeated its criticisms from last year. She said that when hospitals fail, the Welsh government blames the local health boards, but when schools fail, they blame the local authority, the schools, the head teacher, and anyone but their own government.\n\nThe first minister, Carwyn Jones, has defended the Welsh government\u2019s record on education. He said that Estyn has praised the foundation phase for the under-sevens, and that most schools have generally good performance. He also pointed out that the Welsh government has laid out a 20-point plan to improve the situation, and that extra funding for children from less well-off backgrounds, part of a budget deal between Labour and the Lib Dems, will help pupils reach the desired standards.\n\nIn conclusion, the report by Estyn has highlighted the issue of functional illiteracy in Wales, with 20% of children starting secondary school being functionally illiterate.

These two countries have often cooperated with each other, sharing similar political and cultural values, as well as a history of colonization and imperialism. The article explores the impact of recent events on the Anglo-American order, or the post-war Anglo-American alliance. The author argues that the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States has caused a shift in the global order, as he has taken a more isolationist stance and abandoned many of the traditional American values that have been integral to the Anglo-American order. The British government's decision to leave the European Union has also had a significant impact, as it has undermined the unity and influence of the EU and left the UK isolated in the global economy.

This is a significant gain from the 193 seats they held in the previous Congress. The Democrats have made gains in traditionally Republican-leaning districts, and have also picked up a number of seats in historically Democratic districts. The Democrats' gains in the House have been driven by a strong turnout from suburban and urban areas, as well as from minority communities.\n\nIn the Senate, the Republicans have retained their majority, with at least 53 seats out of the 100 total. This is a gain of two seats from the previous Congress, as the Republicans have managed to hold on to a number of seats in traditionally Republican-leaning states. The Republicans' gains in the Senate have been driven by strong turnout from rural areas, as well as from white working-class voters.\n\nThe 2018 midterm elections have been a major shift in the political landscape of the United States. The Democrats' gains in the House of Representatives will give them the power to block the Republican agenda and to investigate the Trump administration. The Republicans' gains in the Senate will give them the power to confirm conservative judges and to pass legislation.

The legislation declares a climate emergency and proposes a series of targets to cut carbon emissions. The article highlights that the Environment Minister Edwin Poots called a motion for legislation within three months \"ridiculous\". However, the group of experts have taken the bill forward as a private members bill with cross-party support. The article also mentions the Green Party leader Clare Bailey who is the lead sponsor of the bill and virtually all the other parties are co-sponsoring it, with the exception of the DUP. The bill sets out plans for targets for greenhouse gases as well as measures to tackle issues around water, soil and agriculture. The article also mentions the Environment Minister Edwin Poots' response to the bill, where he claims to be \"happy to consider any proposals put forward\" and calls for a \"balanced approach to tackling climate change.\" Mr Poots also says that he is finalizing a discussion paper on a future climate change bill consultation and that it will be released in \"the next number of weeks.\" The article highlights that Mr Poots has asked for advice from the UK Climate Change Committee on what Northern Ireland's contribution to the UK's 'net zero' 2050 emissions target should be.

Popular petitions have raised issues such as sick pay for the self-employed, pay rises for NHS workers and tuition fee refunds for students. The number of online submissions has been unprecedented, and the issues raised have fed into letters MPs have written to ministers on their handling of the pandemic. However, it is not possible to schedule debates on petitions in Parliament because the normal venue, Westminster Hall, is closed. The letter to other committee chairs highlights that popular petitions have received an overwhelming response, with the most popular online petition, with 696,682 signatures, calling on the government to extend statutory sick pay to people who are self-employed. The two next most popular petitions, launched on 6 and 12 March, called for ministers to consider closing schools and implement a \"lockdown\" - both measures which have since been imposed in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. A petition calling for students affected by university closures to have tuition fees reimbursed has garnered 330,859 signatures, and it received much greater levels of support in cities such as London, Bristol and Brighton.\n\nYou must proofread your paper.

The article highlights that Mr. Rowlands is standing for election in Cardiff South and Penarth in May, and that neither he nor the Conservative Association have responded to requests for comment. The article also mentions that the Public Service Ombudsman had recommended no further action be taken against Mr. Rowlands, but that an appeal against this decision had been made.\n\nThe article goes on to describe the details of the case against Mr. Rowlands. According to the article, Mr. Rowlands was a director of The Watering Hole caf\u00e9 and wine bar, which opened in June 2019 without change of use planning permission. The article also mentions that Mr. Rowlands was at the time, and continues to be, a member of the Vale of Glamorgan council's planning committee. The article quotes the ombudsman's report, which says that Mr. Rowlands found planning matters complicated and difficult to understand, and that he had not grasped that not having planning permission would be a breach of planning control.\n\nThe article also mentions that The Watering Hole website featured a picture of Mr. Rowlands wearing his mayoral chains, and that the opening of the wine bar was subject to objections from residents and negative publicity in the press. The article concludes by mentioning that Mr. Rowlands continues to stand for election in Cardiff South and Penarth, and that it is unclear if the Conservative Association was aware of the investigation into Mr. Rowlands when he was selected to stand.\n\nIn conclusion, the article highlights the case of Leighton Rowlands, a Welsh councillor who was accused of improper conduct for opening a wine bar without planning permission. The article describes the details of the case, and quotes the ombudsman's report, which suggests that Mr. Rowlands' behavior showed a lack of judgement.

The party will abolish the role of president, give members an equal vote, and set up a leader's team. The changes are designed to strengthen the party and make it more effective in government. Plaid's leader, Leanne Wood, said the changes would help the party achieve its goal of becoming the party of government in 2016. The changes to the constitution were based on a report by party economic policy adviser Eurfyl ap Gwilym, who recognized the party's lack of electoral progress and made recommendations for structural and membership changes. Mr. ap Gwilym welcomed the changes to the constitution as \"extremely important for achieving the goals set out by Camu 'Mlaen.\" The changes to the constitution recognize constituencies as the main unit of party organization instead of local branches or county parties.

But it has cut the scheme for 2018\/19, as the cost of uniforms had \"reduced\". The Bevan Foundation said it was a \"mealy-mouthed\" justification for a cut that would save a small sum. Dr Victoria Winckler, the think tank's director, said the grant was \"not perfect\" but the decision to end it was a \"surprise\". \"It's quite a big expense, especially if you've got more than one child,\" she said. \"And that comes on top of an expensive school holiday period, where you've had to pay for extra meals, and perhaps for entertainment and so on. \"For families that are already on low incomes, it can be a real blow. \"It's no accident that pay day loan companies are very active around that time of year, the start of the school term.\" The scheme was introduced in 2005 with its latest incarnation offering eligible pupils \u00a3105 before they start secondary school in Year 7. The grant has been administrated by councils, with parents applying to their local authority for the money. Dr Winckler also called for low-cost uniforms to be available in supermarkets and other outlets, and to have sew-on badges.

The BBC's Pumza Fihlani speaks to some women in Johannesburg about their attitudes towards sex, men and getting them to use condoms. Chwayita Bam, 31, real estate agent: I'm in a new relationship now and one of the first things we spoke about is condoms. I told him straight, \"I don't know where you've been, you don't know where've I've been. I don't know your status so we have to use a condom.\" He wasn't too happy with the decision but he agreed. It becomes a bit awkward because at times in the heat of the moment we need to stop what we're doing to grab a condom and it interrupts the whole thing. We've spoken about getting tested for HIV together so we can stop using them but I've explained to him that because I'm not on any contraception - this is my only way of preventing pregnancy. I've been in a situation in the past where a guy wanted to have sex without a condom and we had a massive fight about it, he even became physical. He didn't understand why I wouldn't sleep with him without it. I was blunt. I told him, \"If you force yourself on me it will be rape.\" That scared him and he stopped. I didn't ever see him again. People say when you're having sex without a condom it's a lot nicer, I agree and I think that's why some people, including women, don't like them. But the reality is that there are many diseases so we're forced to use them so we don't get sick. Nomandla Mabaso, 22, university student It is condoms or no sex at all for me. Guys just don't want to use condoms but in the end they'd rather have sex with a condom than no sex at all - if more women got that they'd actually have more control, they'd feel more at ease with insisting on it. I don't know that it's a power thing more than it being a case of us wanting to please our partners.

Dr Patricia Parker, Endowed Professor of Zoological Studies at the University of Missouri St Louis, says that the situation is precarious, particularly for species such as the Galapagos penguin, which live in very small populations. The parasite that causes avian malaria (Plasmodium) requires passage through the digestive and circulatory systems of a biting insect in order to reproduce. The insect is considered the primary host of the parasite. For the Plasmodium parasite to complete its life-cycle, it must then be transmitted to a suitable bird host through the saliva of the biting insect. The parasite then goes through a massive multiplication phase in the liver of the animal before entering the bloodstream. From there, the next biting insect that takes a blood meal picks them up. But not all birds are competent hosts. Dr Parker and her team, scientists from UMSL, Galapagos National Park, Charles Darwin Foundation and Saint Louis, are trying to identify which species of mosquito is responsible for vectoring it and which bird species is the reservoir for this parasite. They have studied 3,726 samples from 22 endemic birds.","384":"1.

In 1971, Manoli gave birth to a healthy baby boy, but he was immediately taken away for \"routine\" tests. Nine interminable hours passed before a nun informed her that her son had died.

However, Mrs Justice Andrews dismissed the challenge and ruled that the decision was not irrational.\n\nThe government had initially granted a license for the cull in Derbyshire last year, but in September, the government decided not to grant the license. The NFU lawyers argued that the real reason for the decision was because the prime minister took a \"personal interest\" in the issue.\n\nThe NFU lawyers further claimed that Dominic Dyer, the Badger Trust's chief executive, had lobbied the prime minister's partner, Carrie Symonds, in Downing Street. However, Sir James Eadie QC, from Environment Secretary George Eustice's legal team, argued that the idea that there was \"something sinister\" about the prime minister's involvement was \"unsustainable\".\n\nMrs Justice Andrews, who analyzed arguments at a hearing on Skype in April, ruled that the decision not to grant the license was not irrational.

The Health and Social Care Board has recently approved a recommendation that A&E units should be retained at the Royal Victoria and Mater hospitals only. However, a question mark still remains over the long-term future of Belfast City Hospital's A&E unit. When the City's A&E unit shut, it was reported that hospitals nearby would have to cope with an extra 40,000 patients attending their emergency departments. At a specially convened meeting of Belfast Health Trust on Tuesday, senior executives were given details about how the closure has been affecting Belfast's other two main hospitals over the past nine months.\n\nDr Patricia Donnelly, the trust's director of acute services, produced figures showing that the number of people going to emergency departments at the Royal Victoria and the Mater hospitals had dropped by around 15%. She also confirmed that over the same period, there has been a 26% reduction in patient waiting times at both those emergency departments. Dr Donnelly said trust executives discussed three options which included having A&E services at all three main Belfast hospitals, retaining emergency units at the Royal and Mater and thirdly, concentrating A&E services at the Royal only. She explained the trust had looked at different criteria, including patient safety and quality of service before deciding to endorse the option of retaining A&E at the Mater and the Royal only. 'Able to cope'\n\nDr Donnelly said \"any solution would have to have the RVH\" because it is Northern Ireland's regional trauma centre, and has intensive care provision, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, fracture clinic and also specialises in the treatment of stroke patients. She added the Mater Hospital was \"a small district general hospital\" which has \"fewer blue light ambulance attendances for seriously complex or ill patients so they're able to cope with those patients very well\". She argued that it was \"welcome news\" that the trust had decided to retain A&E units at the Royal and Mater hospitals.

The group has been responsible for numerous atrocities against civilians, including the Yazidi community in Iraq. The Yazidis are a minority ethnic group who practice an ancient faith that ISIS considers to be devil worship. In a new report, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says that ISIS had \"the intent... to destroy the Yazidi as a group.\" Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled their villages in northern Iraq amid ISIS advances last summer. Many were killed or captured and enslaved. The report, commissioned by the OHCHR, is based on more than 100 interviews with survivors of attacks in Iraq between June 2014 and February this year. Among the atrocities it says were perpetrated against the Yazidi community by ISIS, were: The report adds: \"In some instances, villages were entirely emptied of their Yazidi population.\" A statement by the OHCHR says: \"One witness described how two ISIS members sat laughing as two teenage girls were raped in the next room. \"A pregnant woman, repeatedly raped by an ISIS 'doctor' over a period of two-and-a-half months, said he deliberately sat on her stomach. \"He told her: 'This baby should die because it is an infidel; I can make a Muslim baby'. \" The plight of the Yazidi population was brought to international attention when ISIS captured the town of Sinjar in August 2014. Thousands of residents, mainly Yazidis, were forced to flee. Many were trapped on nearby Mount Sinjar, which was surrounded by ISIS fighters.

Many people have cover for blocked drains as part of their home insurance. However, sometimes a CMC will offer to handle the claim for them, charging a significant sum. Direct Line says some people end up paying thousands of pounds to such companies when they could contact their insurance company for free. The firm says there has been a sharp rise in the number of claims being made for blocked drains. In the first quarter of 2017, it estimates the number increased by 22% compared to 2016, with no apparent or logical explanation. Hefty cost It's thought that in some cases, unscrupulous drainage firms are selling details of their clients to CMCs. Those CMCs then approach the householder and ask them to sign a bit of paper, typically promising to give the management company 10% of the eventual insurance payout. Direct Line says that in some cases, people can also be confused about whether they are dealing with a drain repair company or a CMC. \"It is important that vulnerable customers who have an issue with their property are not taken advantage of by companies that are looking to profit from their misfortune,\" said Katie Lomas, director of Direct Line Home Insurance. \"Fraudulent and inflated claims drive up the cost of policies for all consumers. Anyone that thinks they may need to make a claim on their insurance policy should contact their provider directly.\" As part of its research, Direct Line examined more than 2,000 drainage claims made in the last year.

Not yet - and the privacy-conscious way in which they are designed could mean we will never know how effective they have been. Last month, the UK government announced that it was abandoning a centralised NHS contact-tracing app for England and switching to a decentralised version, based on the Apple-Google toolkit. This model has been favoured by privacy campaigners because the matching process takes place on users' smartphones rather on a central computer, providing a greater degree of anonymity. But the government stressed that the new version would not arrive in a hurry, and Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that no country in the world had a functioning contact-tracing app. The Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Keir Starmer, immediately pointed to Germany, as did many others who disputed the prime minister's claim. Germany's Corona-Warn-App was rolled out nationwide in June. A few days ago, the Robert Koch Institute provided an update on its progress, celebrating the fact that it had now been installed by around 16 million people. \"A successful start that speaks for great interest and acceptance among the population,\" a statement from the app's developer said. Bear in mind, however, that there are 83 million Germans, and it is thought more than half of the population need to have an app before it is truly effective. \"The app works\" added the institute's president Prof Lothar Wieler. He went on to say that about 500 app users had tested positive for the virus and \"had the opportunity to warn others via the app\". But he then said: \"We cannot say exactly how many people were warned, because of the decentralised approach of the app.\" In other words, we do not know whether the software is performing its key function. To know how well your app is performing, it is also vital to know whether users are opting to share the IDs of those they have been in contact with. But the German app has been designed in a way that makes this information very hard to access. The same is true in the UK and other countries that have chosen the decentralised model.

Under this plan, Nationwide will close three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby headquarters, working from home, or a mix of both.\n\nA survey of Nationwide staff found that 57% want to work from home full-time after lockdown ends, while 36% prefer a mix of home and office-based work.\n\nNationwide's chief executive, Joe Garner, said the plan would allow staff to \"locate for their day\" depending on what they need to achieve. He also said that research suggested staff made better decisions when working from home and that the office would still play an important role, but people would not be compelled to go every day.\n\nThe move towards flexible working will see a change to the configuration of offices, with more collaboration spaces and fewer meeting rooms, as well as introducing quiet areas and designated walking and cycling routes.\n\nNationwide said that although branch-based staff are less able to work flexibly, it is looking at ways to help them better manage their working day around their home lives.\n\nThe building society is also trialling an app that allows staff to work remotely, even when they are not in the office. The app will give staff access to their work computer and email from anywhere in the world, making it easier for them to work from home or while on holiday.","417":"In the news article, it mentions that there have been allegations of child sexual exploitation in Telford, a town in the United Kingdom. The local authorities have decided to launch an inquiry to investigate these allegations and have set aside \u00a3350,000 for it. The inquiry will also look into other issues such as modern day slavery and drug use.\n\nAs part of the inquiry, the West Mercia Police have been conducting training sessions for refuse collectors to help them identify potential cases of child sexual exploitation. The training covers topics such as how to spot the signs of abuse, how to report it, and how to provide support to victims.\n\nThe training also covers other issues such as modern day slavery and drug use. The idea is that the refuse collectors, who often come into contact with people in need, can identify potential cases of abuse and report it to the authorities.\n\nSgt Ram Aston, from West Mercia Police, said that the training is aimed at making the community safer for everyone, and that it is important for the refuse collectors to be trained to spot potential cases of abuse.\n\nTim Walters, from Veolia, which runs Telford's refuse collections, also said that the training is a good thing and that it is important for the refuse collectors to be aware of the potential signs of abuse.\n\nThe article also includes an interview with one survivor, who was abused in the 1980s, who said that she thinks the training is a good thing, as long as the police act quickly on information they receive. She said that it is important for the authorities to take the allegations of abuse seriously and to take action to protect children.\n\nFinally, Supt Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police, offered his \"utmost assurance\" that all reports of abuse are taken \"incredibly seriously\" and that the police will take action to investigate and prosecute perpetrators.\n\nIn conclusion, the article highlights the efforts of local authorities and the police in Telford to investigate allegations of child sexual exploitation and to provide training to help identify potential cases of abuse. The training is seen as a positive step towards making the community safer for everyone, and it is important for the authorities to take the allegations of abuse seriously and to take action to protect children.","418":"Medway NHS Foundation Trust has announced that its chairman Denise Harker and chief executive Mark Devlin have decided to step down from their roles.

The Keogh Review found the trust had major failings, including poor communication with patients, poor management of deteriorating patients, inappropriate referrals, delayed discharges, and long waits in A&E.\n\nThe hospital was later told by the Care Quality Commission that it must take urgent action to improve safety on a maternity unit. In November, health regulator Monitor said the hospital's problems were broader than first thought and said it must take urgent action or face leadership changes.\n\nMs Harker and Mr Devlin have decided to hand over leadership of the trust to a new team. Mark Reckless, Conservative MP for Rochester and Strood, said the hospital has appointed a new medical director and a new chief nurse.\n\nHe said the trust is doing good work but improvements have not been fast enough.","419":"The article introduces the singer-songwriter Tom Odell, who has been tipped as the next Hozier or George Ezra.

Located in a terraced house on the city's De Grey Street the venue has played host to Oasis, Pulp, Radiohead and The Stone Roses. Fatboy Slim, also known as Norman Cook, said his return would be \"emotional\". \"Talk about full circle,\" he said. \"I remember rehearsing at the Adelphi in my first band 34 years ago at the very start of my career... and now I get to go back all these years later, for a special show, head held high.\" Cook played bass in the Hull-based band, which had a number of hit albums and singles in the early 1980s. The club's founder, Paul Jackson, said he remembered Cook giving him \u00a35 to pay for the Housemartin's use of the venue as a rehearsal space. \"He immediately struck me both as an extremely nice and smart guy but also as someone, as I had found with his close friend Paul Heaton, who would excel in whatever he turned his arm to,\" he said. \"He deserves great credit for his successful career to date.\" The New Adelphi Club's 200-person capacity will be a big change for the Brighton-based DJ, who played a tour of the UK's largest arenas earlier this year. The concert takes place on 18 October. Last year the club was named a Community Interest Company (CIC) with Pulp front man Jarvis Cocker and Housemartins singer Paul Heaton becoming patrons. A CIC is a company that uses its profits for social purposes.

It showed off a new subscription service called the PlayStation Plus Collection for the PS5. But it appeared to focus on the PS4's greatest hits - including Last of Us Remastered, God of War and Bloodborne - rather than any of the PS5's forthcoming releases. \"Microsoft has a really appealing offering with the Xbox Series S pricing at just \u00a3250, and Sony doesn't really have an answer to that for people who just want the cheapest possible entry point to next-generation gaming,\" video games journalist Laura Dale told the BBC. \"However, people who want to play any of Sony's first-party franchises are unlikely to be swayed to Xbox just for the Series S. \"I think there's a real chance that Microsoft might win this first round of the next-gen battle, but it might be because Sony is pricing themselves out of the market, rather than Microsoft doing anything particularly revolutionary.

The report, which addresses a small number of solvent canisters on the site since 1992, highlights the need for better procedures in place to dispose of potentially hazardous chemicals. The report found that priority was not given to the disposal of redundant chemicals and that there was a lack of recognition of the risk associated with their degradation. Recommendations made by the report include a site-wide review of potentially hazardous chemicals and a new system for the control of inventories. Steve Bostock, Sellafield Ltd chief operating officer, said that the site is home to some of the oldest and most complex risks and hazards anywhere in the world and that it is the responsibility of the company to manage these hazards in a way that protects the workforce, the local community and the environment. The company is confident that the report's recommendations will improve their approach to the management of chemicals and inform their approach to other potential hazards on the site.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com March 25, 2023, 11:00 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/english-language-and-literature\/summary-writing\/summary-of-a-non-fiction-article-505811\n\nThis summary will include the main ideas of the text and what the main ideas are and what the author is trying to get across.\n\n$2.19","424":"The IMF calls for France to lower its labor costs and stop tax hikes in order to boost its competitiveness and growth. In its annual assessment, the IMF also forecasts that France's economy will contract slightly more than previously forecast, with GDP expected to fall by 0.2% this year. The IMF sees deep structural issues affecting France's growth potential due to the loss of competitiveness, and it expects the French economy to shrink by 0.2% this year, down from a previous estimate of 0.1%. The IMF expects economic growth of 0.8% in 2014, just below its previous prediction of 0.9% growth. Mr Gardner praised two recent reforms in France: a tax credit that reduces payroll taxes for companies paying low salaries and a change to employment law aimed at reducing the cost of firing staff. However, he added that these reforms are \"really initial steps of a process that needs to be deepened and broadened.\" Last week, the European Commission gave France two years to trim its budget deficit from 3.7% of gross domestic product at the end of 2012 to 3%.

This is attributed to the increase in the cost of learning and then running a car. Some of the prices have gone up slightly, while others, like car insurance, have skyrocketed. According to the government survey, almost two-thirds of young people who can\u2019t drive said they were put off by the cost of learning. It\u2019s not just the cost of lessons and driving test, but also the rise in taxing your car, filling it up with petrol, and the biggest rise for young people \u2013 the cost of car insurance. Insurance companies say a young male driver is 10 times more likely to have an accident than someone over 35. Simon Douglas from the AA says having fewer young drivers on the road is not necessarily a good thing.

As he did so he helped himself to food from the kitchen of the Castle Street bar, leaving his dirty spoon behind. He was also spotted on the bar's CCTV and was later identified by bar staff. Stratford, of no fixed abode, was initially sentenced to 18 weeks in prison at North Somerset Magistrates' Court in Weston-super-Mare on 25 January. His sentence was increased because his offending activated a 16-week suspended sentence for a burglary in August, meaning he has been sentenced to a total of 34 weeks in prison.

The article mentions the Care Inspectorate, who inspected Inverclyde in May and June 2017. The inspection focused on how well services worked together to make a positive difference. Inverclyde also received ratings of \"very good\" and \"good\" after the joint inspection. The way staff assessed and responded to young people's risks and needs was found to be \"adequate\", with some recommendations made. The article also mentions the Inverclyde Alliance, the community planning partnership chaired by Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe.

The article also mentions how some areas could improve, particularly in the consistency of the initial risk assessment in response to children who may be experiencing neglect, and how action has already been taken to address this. The article also mentions how the current momentum in delivering improvement and change in the lives of children, young people, and their families will be sustained.","432":"The article begins by reporting about the capture of a man who said he had escaped from North Korea by jumping over a border fence. The man, in his late 20s, reportedly said that he was a former gymnast. South Korea's military announced that it would now check every sensor at the inter-Korean border. The system was installed in 2015 and is supposed to alert guards if there is some impact on the fence. However, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff on Thursday said that because of loose screws, sensors had not worked properly. The gymnast defector was later picked up by surveillance cameras. There has been strong criticism over the issue in the South as it's seen as a failure to respond to a potential North Korean infiltration. After the defector had been tracked down, an inspection of the fence showed it had been pressed down - which should have in turn triggered the sensors, had they been working. According to South Korean media, authorities also had the young North Korean jump several times to verify his story of how he crossed the border. About 1,000 people defect from North Korea each year, fleeing a repressive state that has faced numerous accusations of human rights abuses.\n\nAssignment:\nWrite a summary of the above passage in 5 to 10 sentences.

The YJT is led by the Isle of Man Constabulary and is responsible for dealing with young offenders. The report stated that 132 young people were arrested in 2016-17, which increased to 161 in 2017-18.

It follows Wednesday's report by Lancashire County Council planners recommending refusal because of noise and traffic problems. Cuadrilla said it needed time to apply measures to address concerns. The firm said in a statement: \"Lessening any potential impact of our proposed operations on local residents is important to us.\" It said it would apply a further sound barrier around the major parts of the drilling rigs to reduce night-time noise levels. The company also said it had \"agreed in principle\" with Ministry of Defence for all HGV site traffic to go through the RAF Inskip site rather than through the villages of Wharles and Roseacre. The county council's development control committee was due to consider the application in two two-day hearings. The first, concerning Preston New Road site in Little Plumpton, was scheduled for 28-29 January and the Roseacre Wood hearing was due to take place on on 29 and 30 January. The authority said the request to adjourn the hearing would \"be given due consideration\". Cuadrilla's applications were the first since fracking tests near Blackpool were thought to be the \"likely cause\" of earth tremors in 2011. Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - is a technique in which water and chemicals are pumped into shale rock at high pressure to extract gas. A government report published in June 2012 concluded fracking was safe if adequately monitored. However, anti-fracking campaigners claim the process is harmful to the environment.","436":"The article discusses the penalties imposed on Network Rail for violating safety regulations during a severe storm in 2015.

HM Chief Inspector of Railways, Ian Prosser, welcomed the result of the court case and said it should serve as a reminder to Network Rail to continue to acknowledge and act to guard against the serious impact of severe weather on infrastructure. In response, Network Rail launched two task forces to consider the impact of heavy rainfall on the railway and the management of cuttings and embankments.","437":"The article discusses the restoration of the Monsoon Forest, a popular exhibit at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom.

Mr Osborne said the string of northern cities, with better transport links and careful planning, could take on the global cities like London and be \"greater than the sum of their parts\". The building of the east-west link should be considered as part of a review into the second phase of the \u00a350bn HS2 high-speed rail project. The first phase of the project involves linking London with Birmingham, with the final route expected to be chosen by the end of this year. Mr Osborne said in his speech that it was not \"healthy for our economy, not good for our country\" if \"the powerhouse of London dominates more and more\". The plan would be to cut the current fastest rail services between Leeds and Manchester to 30 minutes, with trains travelling at up to 140mph.

The first is creating the South Wales Metro, which involves electrifying the Valleys, longer trains, faster buses, and some light rail services. This will improve connectivity within the region and make it easier for people to travel between different areas. The commission has also highlighted the need for closer working between local councils, as this will help to create a more cohesive and efficient region. The third key point is building more affordable homes, which will make the region more attractive to both residents and businesses. The fourth is boosting people's skills for the jobs to be created, as this will ensure that the region has the workforce it needs to be successful. Finally, the commission has highlighted the need for investment in connectivity, both digitally and in transport. This will make it easier for people to travel within and outside of the region, and will also help to create a more connected and efficient economy.\n\nThe commission has highlighted the factors it says is holding the region back. One of these is an ageing population, which can make it difficult to attract new businesses and investment. Another factor is a lack of the right skills for future employment, which can make it difficult for people to find jobs and for businesses to find the workforce they need. The commission has also highlighted the lack of connectivity, both digitally and in transport, as a major issue.

Only last week an 84-year-old woman died after driving the wrong way on the A1 in Northumberland.\n- The RAC Foundation says the UK's oldest licensed driver is a 107-year-old woman, and there are 191 people over the age of 100 with a licence. They are among 4,018,900 people aged over 70 with full UK driving licences.\n- But how dangerous are older drivers? The Department for Transport (DfT) says there is no evidence older drivers are more likely to cause an accident, and it has no plans to restrict licensing or mandate extra training on the basis of age.\n- There were 10,974 accidents involving drivers over the age of 70 in 2011, says the DfT.

He argued that the BID was \"unfair, unjust and snuck in\", and that it had been created to support town centre shops. Despite his opposition, a judge granted liability orders against 26 firms, including his own, after hearing complaints from four other Andover traders.

He further warned that he would continue to refuse to pay the BID levy, despite being warned by the judge that he could be jailed.

In 2002 a French court convicted him of defending the use of torture. He was stripped of his Legion of Honour, one of France's top merit awards, after the book appeared. Aussaresses never regretted the use of torture. He said \"it became legitimate when the situation demanded it\". He also maintained that the government of the day was not only aware of the atrocities, but also approved them. A member of the National Liberation Front (FLN) who fought in the war, Louisette Ighilahriz, said Aussaresses should have expressed remorse. \"He was honest. He admitted torturing Algerians... But he didn't go all the way. He should have expressed regret,\" she told the AFP news agency. Man of war Born in November 1918 at Saint Paul Cap de Joux in the south of France, Aussaresses enlisted in the French secret services and went on to found the counter-espionage unit. In 1957 he was approached to establish order in Algeria. He himself described the unit he was heading as a \"death squad\" that was charged with carrying out night raids, torture and the removal of certain detainees. After the Algerian war he went to lecture the US special forces at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in the \"techniques of the Battle of Algiers\" including the use of torture. Analysts say many of those techniques were used during the Vietnam War. In 1973, he was sent to Brazil during the military dictatorship as French military attache. In a statement to the French broadcaster, France 24, the French rights group, Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT) said that \"during his career Aussaresses not only practiced torture, but also taught the techniques of torture in clandestine programmes with Latin American dictatorships in the 1970s\".

It has been reported that Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's adviser, is keen to abandon the plan. Mr Clegg said he had so far been unable to secure agreement for the register from both sides of the coalition. Lobbyists are firms or individuals which are paid to influence government decisions. They are often former politicians or civil servants who have developed personal contacts with those in power. Scandal In recent years there have been several scandals involving lobbying, including the resignation of Defence Secretary Liam Fox. Mr Fox allowed defence industry lobbyist Adam Werritty, Mr Fox's former flat mate, to accompany him on foreign trips where he met diplomats, defence staff and defence contractors. Fox said he had \"mistakenly allowed\" personal and professional responsibilities to be \"blurred\". Before the last election, Mr Cameron said of lobbying: \"It is the next big scandal waiting to happen. \"It's an issue that crosses party lines and has tainted our politics for too long, an issue that exposes the far-too-cosy relationship between politics, government, business and money.\" The coalition agreement, which set out the government's programme in 2010, said: \"We will regulate lobbying through introducing a statutory register of lobbyists and ensuring greater transparency.\" Mr Clegg said: \"I do think we need to just honour what we said in the coalition agreement... Like everything in politics, the more open and transparent you can be about stuff the better.\" He added: \"I think the prime minister himself said that he thought inevitably there was going to be another scandal about lobbying at some point, so I do think we need to act.\" Francis Ingham, director general of the Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA), an organisation which represents lobbying firms, says that the governments proposals would not apply to his organisation's members.","451":"The North Korean government called on Friday for South Korea to return its citizens who defected to the South as soon as possible, accusing Seoul of abducting them.

He was speaking after the council's standards committee found former Tory leader Derrick Murphy had brought the office of leader into disrepute. The council said its code was approved by the Local Government Association. Mr Murphy stood down as council leader in January ahead of a standards committee hearing into allegations against him. They related to an email sent to the BBC by a political assistant at County Hall at Mr Murphy's request, allegedly disparaging West Norfolk Council leader Nick Daubney. Mr Murphy was cleared of various accusations but found to have brought the office of leader into disrepute and ordered to undergo ethics training. He did not contest his Freebridge Lynn seat in last month's local elections and is no longer a councillor. 'Storing up problems' Mr Murphy has now made a formal complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman about the standards investigation. He alleges the council did not apply its new code of conduct during its investigation and that members of the standards committee had not been trained. A spokesman for the Local Government Ombudsman was unable to confirm whether the complaint had been received. Mr Neill said: \"Norfolk County Council is storing up huge problems for itself by continuing to enforce a code of conduct that is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. \"It could learn a great deal from other authorities, like South Norfolk District Council, which have made the simple transition to a set of new standards arrangements that are light-touch and good for local democracy.\" Mr Neill also criticised the council's \"highly unusual\" decision to employ barrister Jenni Richards QC and another lawyer to conduct its investigation, at a cost of \u00a344,000.

These changes are seen as a natural evolution of the language and the academy does not have any obstacle to them. The academy recognizes that changes such as this can help to recognize the place of women in today's society. However, it has drawn up a list of rules that the new job titles must follow. For example, the job title must not contravene the elementary and fundamental rules of language. The academy has already accepted some feminine forms of job titles, such as professeure for a woman teacher instead of professeur. But the academy says it will not draw up an \"exhaustive list\" of names, as it would be an insurmountable task. It will accept feminine versions of other job titles, such as auteure, autoresse and autrice for \"author\". The academy will also accept other feminine versions of job titles that already exist, such as pr\u00e9f\u00e8te (prefect), d\u00e9put\u00e9e (MP) and avocate (lawyer). Some job titles may simply have an extra \"e\" as a suffix, such as pr\u00e9f\u00e8te (prefect) and d\u00e9put\u00e9e (MP). Other francophone countries, such as Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Canada, already have feminine forms of job titles. The terms cheffe (female chef), \u00e9crivaine (writer) and ing\u00e9nieure (engineer) have been used in Canada for 40 years. A doctor is called une m\u00e9decin or une docteure.

But the small experiment he was part of is now being rolled out across baseball and other sports.

He manoeuvres the silver saloon slowly through the narrow streets to avoid other traffic, mostly horse-drawn carts and bicycles with extra passengers balanced precariously on the handlebars. His car was a recent reward for his years representing Cuba at the highest level. Before that, he would catch the bus or hitch a lift to training like everyone else. Like all Cuban athletes, the star third baseman received a salary linked to a phantom profession - a state job he never did as he was playing baseball full time - of around $23 (\u00a314) a month, plus bonuses for his many medals. But Enriquez says that by playing in Mexico for just one month before he got injured, he earned \"$5,000 or $6,000\" (\u00a33,075-3,700). \"We're moving away from the idea that the state has to look after us, and we're taking care of ourselves,\" says Enriquez, explaining how the policy change has made it possible for him to buy furniture, furnish his kitchen and install air conditioning in his home. \"I think it's a big advantage.

According to the consultancy Frost and Sullivan, China is the world's second-largest market for health care, reaching $998bn in 2019. JD Health started as an online pharmaceutical and healthcare product retailer, but has branched out into other healthcare services. The firm's IPO prospectus showed it had 72.5 million annual active users as of June 30, compared to 53.5 million at the same time last year. It is one of China's biggest pharmaceutical retailers, selling both to businesses and consumers, with a 30-minute drug delivery service to its users. The company also offers a variety of online telemedicine services, including specialist medical services and traditional Chinese medicine. JD Health launched an online primary care channel in August, with a target of serving 50 million Chinese families in the next five years. According to the prospectus, the company makes more than 80% of its revenues from pharmaceutical and healthcare products. However, the company said that in the first half of 2020, it had an average of approximately 90,000 daily online consultations, an almost six-fold increase from the same quarter in 2019.

Morrissey has previously expressed support for the far-right For Britain party and earlier this month wore a badge with its logo on during a TV show, but he denies he is a racist. Merseyrail apologised and said the posters did not reflect its \"values\". Morrissey has not responded to the rail company's decision. But in a message on his website on Friday, he said: \"With voice extended to breaking point, I call for the prosperity of free speech; the eradication of totalitarian control; I call for diversity of opinion; I call for the total abolition of the abattoir; I call for peace, above all; I call for civil society.\" The world's oldest record shop, Spillers Records in Cardiff, took the decision to stop selling Morrissey albums. It said on Twitter: \"Morrissey's views are not in synch with ours, in fact they are at complete odds and this is why (as an independent) we are not stocking \/ giving our shelf space to his music.\" Morrissey, 60, has denied on multiple occasions he holds racist views. Earlier this month, the Manchester-born singer appeared on The Tonight Show in the USA wearing a For Britain badge on his jacket. He came out in support of the party in an interview in 2018 and in 2018.\n\n## Get Your Custom Essay\n\nDo you have an essay on this topic?

Ireland is the most successful country in the contest's 61 year history, with a total of seven wins. The UK qualifies automatically, with duo Joe and Jake this year's act. It is guaranteed a place in the final as one of the \"big five\" countries along with France, Germany, Italy and Spain. As reigning winners, Sweden also automatically advance to the grand final. Eurovision 2016: Reporter's diary What do fans love about Eurovision? Ukrainian singer's 'family story' Michael Ball: 'My advice for Joe and Jake' The 10 countries that qualified on Thursday are Latvia, Georgia, Bulgaria, Australia, Ukraine, Serbia, Poland, Israel, Lithuania and Belgium. They will join Azerbaijan, Russia, The Netherlands, Hungary, Croatia, Malta, Austria, Armenia, Czech Republic and Cyprus who all made it through the first semi-final on Tuesday. Political tensions The Ukrainian entry, jazz artist Jamala, which got through Thursday's heat, has stirred political tensions with Russia. Jamala is first ever Crimean Tatar to perform at the contest, and her song 1944 is about former Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, Crimea and claims of ethnic cleansing. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, as conflict between the two countries escalated. After Thursday night's semi-final, Byrne thanked his fans, and apologised for failing to make the final. He tweeted: \"Amazing time amazing support, I gave it my all, I'm sorry I didn't get us there.

This impressive achievement is attributed to the zoo's popularity and the fact that it houses wildlife from South East Asia. However, the zoo faced a setback in 2018 when a fire broke out, which was caused by an electrical fault. Some animals died in the fire, but the zoo has since reopened, and it has been approved for the development of Grasslands, which is set to open in 2022. The zoo's chief executive, Mark Pilgrim, emphasized the importance of visitors in the zoo's efforts to protect wildlife and to draw attention to the threats facing wildlife globally. He also highlighted the different ways that people can help make a difference in protecting wildlife. The zoo's Grasslands development will include lodges, tents, and a restaurant, which will add to the zoo's attractions.","470":"Some commentators have said that the successor of George Entwistle, the Director General of BBC, will be someone from outside the organization with a fresh approach. BBC has started the disciplinary measures against some of the people involved in the decision to air a Newsnight report on care homes in North Wales. The broadcast led to former Conservative treasurer Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child abuse allegations. Entwistle resigned following the Newsnight broadcast and acting director general Tim Davie has vowed to \"get a grip of the situation.\" According to the article, BBC's next director general is likely to be an outsider to ensure that the corporation is given a complete overhaul after the Newsnight scandal. Lord Patten of Barnes, chairman of the BBC Trust, is understood to want a new director general who is not a BBC lifer like George Entwistle, who resigned on Saturday after 54 days in the job. Sources said that the chairman was considering making a direct approach to a number of individuals who did not apply for the job rather than advertise it again. Alternatively, he may reconsider the four non-BBC figures who applied for the role earlier this year. Politicians should call for decisive action, but must not intervene directly, because BBC independence really matters. Trust is an overused term, but a guarantee of impartiality and accuracy in news and reporting is what the corporation is for. Calls for it to be broken up, slimmed down and generally punished have inevitably followed this turbulent period. But to assume that it operates in a normal commercial market is to miss the fact that the BBC is an institution that is sorely needed to counter-balance failures in the market. Newsnight's own woes were allocated 15 of the available 45 minutes, which felt about right. And, after several editions on which BBC management had refused to comment, Monday night's Newsnight programme finally gave viewers the chance to see George Entwistle interviewed by Jeremy Paxman.","471":"They were launched over the sea early on Thursday, from Wonsan on North Korea's east coast. A JCS official said at least one of the missiles travelled about 690km (428 miles) and appeared to be a new design. It marks the first time North Korea has fired any missiles since leader Kim Jong-un's impromptu meeting with Donald Trump late last month. It also comes after anger from the North over planned military exercises between South Korea and the US, an annual event. The North warned they could affect the resumption of denuclearisation talks. The first missile was launched at about 05:34 Thursday local time (20:34 GMT Wednesday) and the second at 05:57, said the JCS. Initial reports said both missiles travelled about 430km, reaching an altitude of 50km, before falling into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. But after analysis from US and South Korean intelligence officials, the JCS said at least one was likely to have been a \"new type of missile\". Japan's defence minister said the launches did not reach Japanese waters and had no immediate impact on its national security. It is not clear if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw Thursday's launch. South Korea's defence ministry has urged Pyongyang to stop acts that it said were unhelpful for easing tension, reported Reuters. 'North Korea is clearly upset' After an invitation on Twitter in June, US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Mr Kim had an impromptu meeting at the demilitarised zone that divides the two Koreas, where they agreed to restart denuclearisation talks. Following that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said working-level talks would likely start in July, but there have been no further public meetings between US and North Korean officials. But North Korea has condemned the planned US-South Korea military drills next month, calling it a \"violation of the spirit\" of the joint statement signed by Mr Trump and Mr Kim at their first face-to-face talks in Singapore last year.

However, the government said there was currently no timetable for the introduction of the bill. There is a growing market for launching small or nano satellites which could be used for communications such as broadband.

Legislation concerning space is reserved to Westminster.\n\nThe UK's government's Department for Transport (DfT) is responsible for the Modern Transport Bill, which would set regulations for driverless cars as well as allowing UK aerodromes to access space.

A spokeswoman for the DfT said: \"The final date for the introduction of the Modern Transport Bill will be announced in due course. \"We are creating the legislative and regulatory framework to allow the development of spaceports in the UK. It will be for the market to decide where the first spaceport will be established.\"\n\nPrestwick airport's director of spaceport development Richard Jenner said it had done a lot of work in preparation for applying for a spaceport licence. He said the airport was now waiting for the regulations to \"clarify\" what was needed to become a spaceport. He told BBC Scotland: \"If the delay's only short I don't think it's a big problem at all. \"As I understand it, the UK government are still very committed to launching the first rocket by 2020 and they are very keen for us to progress so I don't think there's any change in their intent. \"I think it's just a delay due to the parliamentary process.\"\n\nPrestwick commissioned a report in 2015 which said it would cost between \u00a318m and \u00a336m to build a launchpad.

The plan was drawn up by EU leaders in June as Italy called for more controls on migration. But Mohamed al-Taher Siala told an Austrian newspaper that all North African countries reject the idea.

In June, the EU proposed \u201cregional disembarkation platforms\u201d in North Africa, where the UN and other agencies could screen those who have a genuine claim to asylum in Europe. Those not eligible would be offered help to resettle in their home countries. The plan was to break the business model of people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. The move followed complaints from Italy, which has long been the main arrival point for boatloads of migrants from African countries fleeing poverty and violence. According to the United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018.\n\nWhat has Libya said? \u201cAll North African countries reject this proposal - Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya, as well,\u201d Mr Siala told the Austrian newspaper Die Presse.

Margerie Thaw and her husband, usually living with their daughter and her family, had moved out to a site in East Yorkshire, Burton Constable Holiday Park, which has 430 homes. They are concerned about the impact moving back could have on their health. \"Out daughter is at-risk - she has diabetes and asthma - and her husband is still working and there's two children,\" Mrs Thaw said. \"So what happens there? We'll be at-risk.\" New measures, including banning public gatherings of more than two people and restricting people from leaving their homes except for food shopping or for medical treatment medicine, exercise or travelling to work in an essential job, were announced by the Prime Minister as a \"moment of national emergency\". After receiving guidance from the industry's trade association, Burton Constable Holiday Park sent a letter to residents which said it would close and access barriers would be deactivated by 16:00 GMT on Wednesday. Rodrica Straker, from the park, said many people had come to the site to self-isolate and she wanted \"straight line, black-and-white absolute clarity\" from the authorities. \"They're feeling that their residence where they normally live is not a safe environment for various reasons,\" she said. \"They're being told they have to go back into a situation which they feel might be precarious - with loved ones who might be vulnerable, and in some case they really feel they don't want to be there\".","488":"In this article, it talks about the safeguard of corroboration in Scots law and how it has been a requirement for centuries.

Lord Hope of Craighead is quoted as saying that he is concerned that without corroboration people could be convicted on their own confession, which he believes is \"absolutely fundamentally wrong in Scots law.\" He also states that the Scottish government's Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill proposes other law changes to balance the rights of suspects and victims.\n\nLord Hope of Craighead said he would be \"very sad\" to see the safeguard go. Corroboration - the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources - has been a requirement in Scots law for centuries. The Scottish government wants to remove the barriers that might prevent cases such as rape being taken forward. It said the requirement for corroboration could prevent strong cases being prosecuted and the reforms represents a move towards focusing on the best quality of evidence available, rather than meeting an outdated technical requirement. In an interview with Holyrood Magazine, Lord Hope - who was deputy president of the UK Supreme Court until four months ago - said he was concerned that without corroboration people could be convicted because they had confessed to a crime. He was quoted by the magazine as saying: \"I just express concern that the proposal seems very far-reaching and, potentially, quite dangerous if you have a situation where somebody is at risk of being convicted on his own confession which I would have thought was absolutely fundamentally wrong in Scots law. \"It may be that the number of cases that go to trial now on confessions are comparatively few, but we developed our law of corroboration initially as a barrier against people being taken to court on a confession which had been extracted by torture. \"This is in the early 18th century when things were very, very different, and people reacted against this, and I'd be very sad to see that kind of protection go.\" 'More selective' He acknowledged there was a \"real problem\" with cases which take place where there are no witnesses other than the victim and accused, such as many rapes and sexual assaults.

Stephens, who was armed with a gun, shot dead the 74-year-old victim as he walked home from Easter lunch on Sunday afternoon. Facebook has launched a review of its procedures after criticism that the footage stayed on the site for hours. Justin Osofsky, Facebook\u2019s vice-president of global operations, said the first complaint made about the video showing the killing came nearly two hours after it was posted. However, he added that they needed to do better. Police have asked residents of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania to be on the alert, saying suspect could be anywhere. Cleveland police department have issued a photo of Mr Stephens, 37, on its website, describing him as a black male, 6ft 1in (1.86m) and 244lb (110kg). Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters on Monday that Mr Stephens, who has a licence to carry a concealed firearm, is armed \"without a doubt\". Cleveland officials have also offered a $50,000 (\u00a339,805) reward for information that leads to his location. His mobile phone signal was last tracked on Sunday afternoon in Erie, Pennsylvania. Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said in a press conference on Monday morning: \"Steve is still out there some place\u2026 we're still asking Steve to turn himself in, but if he doesn't we'll find him.\" FBI Special Agent Stephen Anthony said: \"Quite frankly, he could be in a lot of places.\" US Marshall Peter Elliot said law enforcement agencies across the US were helping create a dragnet to \"make this individual's world very, very, very small\".

Laura Holden, from Reed, says: \"Recruiters may review the digital profiles of candidates they're interviewing or looking to hire, as it's a quick and easy way to learn more about the individual.\" A recent survey from reed.co.uk found that 43% of recruiters check digital profiles often. Other surveys show the vast majority, upwards of 80%, look at least once at a candidate's online presence. And it isn't snooping, it is perfectly legal for a prospective employer - or anyone - to look at whatever they like. David D'Souza, head of engagement at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), explains: \"That's fine - and they can act on what they see - as long as it is not against the law.\" He says they need to avoid violating the Equality Act of 2010 - they must not discriminate against people because of a \"protected characteristic\", which can become clearer online, such as religion, age, ethnicity or disability. Mr D'Souza, says: \"For example, if you looked at me and didn't give me the job because you spotted a disability, that would not be OK, but if it was because of a tweet I sent, that's fine, even if that tweet was within the law.\" Privacy settings For those beginning their careers, what they have done online looms larger when there's little in the way of career experience to guide a new employer, giving new entrants to the job market another major issue to deal with. One simple step Reed recommends is a quick review of privacy settings, to restrict visibility. The site's head of marketing and strategy, Jack Hollingsworth, says: \"The first thing anyone should do is to check their privacy settings. I think the biggest risk is that people aren't aware of what is in the public domain and who is able to see it. \"For example, if you are a parent looking to get a job, an employer will look you up.

The center will create 300 new jobs in the city, with an average salary of \u00a333,000 per year. The Northern Ireland Executive and Invest NI have offered Tullett Prebon over \u00a32m towards the creation of the new jobs, with the Department for the Economy Assured Skills programme providing \u00a3400k for associated training. The announcement of 300 jobs is the largest the Northern Ireland executive has been able to unveil in ten months, and continues Belfast's track record of attracting well paid jobs in the financial services sector. The negotiations about the jobs took a year to conclude and were set in motion long before the EU referendum, the outcome of which did not torpedo an important inward investment. The executive and Invest NI are very keen to project a business-as-usual message and this announcement aids that narrative. However, beneath the surface, the DUP and Sinn Fein are deeply at odds over what a Brexit future holds for the local economy. The announcement of 300 jobs will be welcomed all round, but nothing can really be read into its wider significance vis-\u00e0-vis Brexit and whether that will disadvantage Northern Ireland's chance of inward investment.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com December 9, 2022, 1:06 pm ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/business\/marketing-planning\/summary-300-new-jobs-tullett-prebon-belfast-597462\n\nThe key points of the article are summarized.\n\n$2.49","497":"In this article, the author talks about Hamza Kashgari, a Saudi Arabian citizen, who was sent back to Saudi Arabia on Sunday despite protests from human rights groups.

Some social media users welcomed the U-turn, describing it as a \"good call\", while others said the decision was taken \"because the magazines weren't selling too well. Too bad free porn is still easy to access\". On Monday, Mr Hefner wrote: \"I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated. \"Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem,\" added the 25-year-old son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner.

Samir Husni, a journalism professor at the University of Mississippi, said Playboy's ban on nudity had probably alienated more readers than it attracted. \"Playboy and the idea of non-nudity is sort of an oxymoron,\" he told the Associated Press. The magazine still had to find a way to appeal to a younger audience in a digital age where nudity has become commonplace, Mr Husni added. In next month's issue, the magazine will also revive some of its old franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes. It also features an essay by actress Scarlett Byrne about the Free the Nipple campaign - a movement that started in the US to change laws around breastfeeding in public and female toplessness.

Despite staff \"going above and beyond\" to support patients in desperate times, using mobile phones and iPads to connect seriously ill patients and their families, contact is just not always possible.

The director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said they were not meeting legal obligations from the Equality Act. But the health boards said they were striving to improve access for the deaf and hard of hearing. Meanwhile, a separate report shows that 90% of GPs in Wales are failing to provide reasonable alternative methods for deaf people to book appointments. The Equality Act 2010 says that if someone is at a substantial disadvantage of accessing services because of a disability, reasonable adjustments must be made to allow access. The director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru Richard Williams said health boards were failing to meet that legal obligation. \"Hearing people don't have to walk to the GP's surgery to book an appointment or ask others to call on their behalf. If you can't use the phone it's a considerable hurdle to booking an appointment,\" he said. \"I don't think it's reasonable that deaf and hard of hearing people have to wait for access and that they are treated differently from others in how they access services. \"If you sat anyone from the health service down and explained the difficulties, none of them would be able to justify why that's the case.\" In response, the health boards said while they had some provisions in place for deaf people - such as booking some appointments online, bookable sign language interpreters and hearing loop systems in place - they were striving to improve access for those who are deaf and hard of hearing.

Dr Bruce Alberts, editor of Science, was asked by US security advisers not to publish parts of the work because of concerns it could help terrorists to develop a biological weapon. But he says it is important to get the research out quickly to scientists and health officials monitoring the virus. Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Vancouver, he said: \"Our position is that, in the absence of any mechanism to get the information to those scientists and health officials who need to know and need to protect their populations and to design new treatments and vaccines, our default position is that we have to publish in compete form.\" 'Academic freedom' The controversy is centred on two research papers - one of which was submitted to Science, the other to another leading journal, Nature, last year. They showed that the H5N1 virus could relatively easily mutate into a form that could spread rapidly among the human population. The studies prompted the US National Security Advisory Board for Biotechnology (NSABB) to ask both journals last November to redact some sensitive parts of the research, which it believed could be used by terrorists to develop such a virus. The request caused outcry among some scientists who believed that it was an infringement of academic freedom. Some pointed out that the scientists had given presentations about their work at conferences and the details were already widely circulated, so redaction would have little purpose. The scientists who carried out the research, and the journals concerned, have been considering the request and listening to suggestions as to how the research results could be redacted in the scientific journals, but distributed to bona fide researchers who urgently need the information\n\nSummary:","3":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Modelled on the Drudge Report, the American aggregator site that generates huge traffic, Westmonster will be powered by the social media reach of Leave.EU, the campaign to which Mr Banks gave close to \u00a37m - the largest donation in British political history. Leave.EU has nearly 800,000 followers on Facebook and Mr Heaver believes he can use that base to generate substantial traffic from day one. Westmonster will publish some original news, and Mr Heaver hopes to enlist more celebrity writers than backbench MPs. The site will launch with an article from Nigel Farage, and Mr Heaver is open about wanting to ape the opinionated, anti-establishment, highly provocative tone of Breitbart. This launch is significant for several reasons. It shows that the anti-establishment media which helped to power the campaign of Donald Trump is coming to Britain.

The first section, a four-mile (6km) stretch between the A1067 Fakenham Road and the A140 at Norwich Airport, opened to traffic at 06:00 GMT. The bypass is due to be completed by spring 2018. Norfolk County Council spokesman John Birchall said the road was \"a huge achievement\", adding it was thought to be the \"biggest infrastructure road project of its kind in the country at the moment led by a local authority\". He warned motorists there could be \"a lot of people who just want to come and see the new road\" and that the \"traffic patterns will not settle down for a few weeks\". Chair of the council's environment, development and transport committee, Martin Wilby, said the road was not just for now, \"but for the future prosperity of Norfolk\". The road is costing at least \u00a3178m and has taken two years of construction to get to this point. A number of local transport and environment groups have objected to its construction, including the Norwich Cycling Campaign. Its chairman, Richard Jennings, said he was concerned at the number of roundabouts on the new bypass, \"which generally are very dangerous for cyclists\". The western section of the NDR was easier to construct because of the geology of the area and was always likely to be finished first, explained project manager Ian Taylor. \"The next section, from the airport to the A1151 Wroxham Road, will open around Christmas, and the third and final phase through to Postwick will probably be mid-March, but we've got the vagaries of winter to come,\" he said.\n\nSummary:","6":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

She says the plan could damage ancient woods, just as ministers are pledging more protection for national parks. Highways England says the project will solve congestion round Arundel. But campaigners say the organisation\u2019s case has been undermined by new calculations showing that economists have over-estimated by three-fold the number of vehicles that would be using the current A27 past Arundel. Highways England reveals A27 bypass route Most people in the area are said by the local council to support a bypass. Some want a new road on any route; others support road-building but want to protect the national park. Another group argues that new roads aren\u2019t needed at all. Judicial review Ms Paren told BBC News that the park\u2019s board doesn\u2019t oppose plans to improve the A27, but insists that a route which would bisect the nature reserve is unacceptable. She said: \u201cWe want to help solve Arundel\u2019s traffic problems but we don\u2019t think Highways England has properly considered routes that don\u2019t damage the national park. \u201cThe government\u2019s rules state that planning permission should be refused for major developments in national parks except in exceptional circumstances and where it can be demonstrated they are in the public interest.\" This argument is at the centre of the judicial review the national park's authority is seeking on the \u00a3250m road plan. The issue is made particularly relevant following a recent promise by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove to seek better protection for national parks, as part of the government\u2019s stated aim of leaving the UK\u2019s natural environment better than it found it.

Experts say the mass probably came from an underwater volcano near Tonga which erupted around 7 August according to satellite images. Sailors have been warned to stay clear of the potential hazard. Pumice is a lightweight, bubble-rich rock that can float in water. It is produced when lava goes through rapid cooling and loss of gases. Large \"rafts\" of the volcanic rock are more likely to form when a volcano is located in more shallow waters, say experts. An Australian couple sailing their catamaran to Fiji were the first to report the \"pumice raft\", after inadvertently entering the rubble at night. \"The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to one knot,\" Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill wrote online on 16 August. \"The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and with our spotlight.\" They were temporarily stuck after rocks jammed their rudder, but then were able to navigate out of the field. They have since sent samples of the pumice stone - which range \"from marble to basketball size\" - to researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia. 'Whole surface turned to land' Associate Prof Scott Bryan, a geologist studying the samples at QUT, said such pumice masses could be seen about once every five years in the region. \"It is a phenomenon reported over time, usually as islands in the middle of the ocean that people encounter but then can't find again,\" he told the BBC. \"It can be as if the whole surface [of the ocean] has turned to land\". Associate Prof Bryan said satellite images showed the field had since divided into two main surface masses, with many trailing \"ribbons\" of rock. \"At the moment there are more than a trillion pieces of pumice all floating together, but over time it will break up and disperse across the area,\" he said. The pumice is currently drifting westwards towards Fij\n\nSummary:","8":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It is easy to think Dedel was brought up in the forest, relying on knowledge passed down the generations. But this is far from the truth. Dedel and his family, like many others living in this region, migrated to the Amazon region from the drought-ridden north-east of Brazil. They came in search of land and eventually got a plot under an ambitious government programme to settle thousands of families along the Transamazon highway. In the 1990s, they practised slash-and-burn agriculture to plant subsistence crops and pasture for cattle. But some families in Dedel's settlement, called Rio Trairao, began to realise that this kind of farming was exhausting the soil. Beauty products The settlers began to consider a new kind of economic activity. Their idea was not to stop their old farming practices overnight but to combine them with the sustainable extraction of oil from the andiroba tree. With the support of an energetic Roman Catholic nun, Sister Angela Sauzen, the Seeds of the Forest project was created. Since then, it has expanded to include more forest products and involve more communities. The transition has not been easy. The settlers had to turn to older communities in the region to learn how to extract the oil. They had to go through the complex bureaucratic process of setting up a company, made all the more difficult because the agrarian reform institute, Incra, has still not recognised their right to the land. They also had to conform to high technical standards to sell their oils to demanding beauty products manufacturers. Some of the families gave up, realising that it would take time to get a good financial return, but many remain enthusiastic. Different aims But the\n\nSummary:","9":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It created a plume of smoke that could be seen several miles away. A Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service spokesman described the fire as \"extremely challenging\". Smoke from the fire could be seen as far as Redcar on Teesside and on social media people reported seeing it in Hartlepool and Newcastle. There were no reported injuries. Assistant chief fire officer Alan Robson said: \"There are still some very deep seated areas of fire within the building, which makes this extremely challenging. \"The waste itself is around 4m (13ft) high, so that's the size of a normal house and the building is more than 100m (328ft) long. \"At this point we are looking at this going for some considerable time yet.

When the NHS said they could only manage her illness, her sister Nancy Stringer launched a campaign to raise \u00a3700,000 for treatment in the US. She said Hope had been \"overwhelmed\" by the support she had received so far. In its first 24 hours, the fundraiser received \u00a355,000 in donations. It has since reached \u00a391,793 and Miss Stringer said any excess funds would be given to Sarcoma UK. The funds have come from more than 1,000 supporters, with donations ranging from \u00a35 to \u00a35,000. Hope wrote a blog about her experience when she learned she had cancer in 2014. In the blog she described how she \"looked like Uncle Fester's love child\" while going through chemotherapy. She was originally treated by the NHS, but her sister said this time it was unable to offer a cure and could only put her through chemotherapy again. Miss Stringer, 29, said that Hope - who was proposed to by her boyfriend Sean Pearce shortly before her cancer returned - was feeling \"scared and emotional\".

Mr Mitchell has always denied using the word but has admitted he had lost his temper and swore at the officers after they refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street. A spokesman for No 10 said of the latest claims: \"Any allegations that a serving police officer posed as a member of the public and fabricated evidence against a cabinet minister are exceptionally serious. \"It is therefore essential that the police get to the bottom of this as a matter of urgency.\" He added: \"We welcome [Metropolitan Police commissioner] Bernard Hogan-Howe's commitment to achieve that aim.\" John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents officers in the Met Police, said: \"The Metropolitan Police Federation unequivocally and categorically refutes any allegation that it was part of a conspiracy to unseat a cabinet minister.\" 'Utmost gravity' A Diplomatic Protection Squad officer was arrested on Saturday by officers investigating how national newspapers came to publish police records of the incident.

Mrs Foster said it was a \"novel and controversial issue\". She said in the light of the High Court ruling on gay blood donors, it was an issue for the Stormont Executive. Deposits Last Friday, a judge ruled Health Minister Edwin Poots did not have the power to keep an \"irrational\" lifetime ban on gay blood donors, and had also breached the ministerial code by failing to take the issue before the Stormont Executive. The code requires individual Stormont ministers to consult their colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive before making decisions that are considered to be highly significant or contentious. It is believed most of the shale gas deposits in Northern Ireland are in the north west and County Fermanagh. The gas has to be extracted using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which involves drilling horizontally into the rock, forcing sand and water underground to cause tiny fractures that release gas from the shale. Mrs Foster said no applications for hydraulic fracturing in Fermanagh had yet been made. However, both ministers confirmed that the company Tamboran planned to drill a deep bore hole to approximately 1,500 metres to obtain a core sample from the shale rock. Mrs Foster told MLAs that local landowners would have to give their permission before a company with a prospecting licence could drill beneath their land.\n\nSummary:","14":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC he was \"absolutely committed\" to reducing homelessness. \"People can look at ministers like me and say 'are they really going to do this?'\" Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast. \"Judge us by the actual actions and this is real action that is going to help people.\" Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler has said she would resign if the problem of rough sleeping worsens while she is in office.

Mr Trump's comments - during a speech in Yuma, Arizona - came after reports that Oracle was working on an offer for some TikTok assets with a group of ByteDance's investors. According to those reports, Oracle was seriously considering buying TikTok's businesses in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand with investment firms, including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital. In February, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellision held a high-profile fundraiser for Mr Trump at his private golf course and estate in California. Earlier this month Mr Trump said the government should get a \"substantial portion\" of the sale price of TikTok's US unit if an American firm buys it. Where does TikTok currently stand in the US? Last week the White House said a government panel that vets foreign transactions - the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US - had recommended that ByteDance should divest TikTok's US operations within 90 days. Mr Trump said there was \"credible evidence\" that TikTok was being used by ByteDance to breach US security. ByteDance has repeatedly denied that it has improperly shared users' data.

The 23-year-old was then attacked and fatally stabbed in the thigh. Rishon Florant, 17, from Waltham Forest, was found guilty of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey. He will be sentenced on 11 October. Chibuzo Ukonu, 18, of Loughton, Essex, was convicted of manslaughter at the same court. Judge Mark Dennis QC lifted an order banning identification of the younger defendant in light of his conviction. 'Flight to Uganda' Ukonu had admitted being present and in possession of a knife but denies intending to harm anyone or causing any injuries to Mr Spence. Jurors were told the attack, which happened at about 18:45 GMT, was captured on CCTV. They heard a BMW Series 5 car, bought by Ukonu days before the attack, dropped the defendants off at the scene. Prosecutor Julian Evans said: \"Glendon ran into the main room and headed towards the far end. \"As he ran, he lost his footing and fell to the ground. He managed to get up but he fell over again near to the corner of the main room close to a table tennis table.\" He said as Mr Spence lay on the floor, Florant stabbed him in his right thigh, which caused \"sudden and immediate blood loss\". Later that night, the BMW car was found fire-damaged and abandoned on the Peabody Estate in south London.

But in April, Theresa May increased funding to patients in England, worth an extra \u00a310,000 in Mr Ellis's case. The UK government said it was liaising with Welsh ministers on greater parity. A public inquiry into the scandal is looking at why thousands of people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. Each of the UK nations has its own financial support scheme for infected patients. In Wales, 175 people receive payments. Mr Ellis said the UK government should increase the funding, not the Welsh Government, as \"we were under one government when infected\". \"How can it be fair? We were infected under the same system,\" he told BBC Wales. \"I've got the same medical condition, same damage done to my body, living with the same anxiety and depression as somebody living in those places.\" The father of one, who was diagnosed with haemophilia as a toddler, believes he was infected by his first dose of the clotting agent Factor VIII. But he did not find out until he was a teenager. \"I was devastated, absolutely devastated,\" he said. Mr Ellis is classed as having hepatitis C at stage two because he has cirrhosis of the liver.

The Wales diagnosis rate is 38.5%, compared to an overall UK figure of 46%. The Welsh government said it was aware of the issue and was taking action to address it. More than 17,000 people have been confirmed with dementia in Wales, an increase of 800 on the previous year, but the society believes there are another 27,000 who have not been diagnosed. Sue Phelps, director for the Alzheimer's Society in Wales said: \"It's encouraging to see any increase in the number of people that are receiving a diagnosis. \"But less than half of people that are living with dementia in Wales aren't receiving the support, benefits and the medical treatments that are often available. \"The NHS has already made a commitment to improving diagnosis rates but the rate in Wales has barely shifted. \"It is time for that commitment to turn into action, to help ensure people can live well with the condition.\" Diagnosis rates vary across the country from 38.5% - up from 37.4% in 2011 - in Wales to 63% in Northern Ireland and 64.4% in Scotland. Those living in south Wales are said to be more likely to get a diagnosis than those living in north Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson said: \"We are aware that there are issues with dementia diagnosis, and have asked the National Leadership and Innovation Agency for Health (NLIAH) to look into this matter. \"We have developed intelligent targets to improve early identification and have set targets to improve this.

Sweden says it has the world's first \"feminist government\". A prominent Iranian women's rights activist and Swedish politicians have criticised the decision. \"It is ruinous to what is called a feminist foreign policy\" said Liberal party chief Jan Bjorklund, who said Iran oppressed women through legislation. The Swedish government should have requested that female members of the delegation should not have been required to wear a headscarf, he said, and that if the request were not granted any trade agreements should have been signed in Sweden or a third country. But Ms Linde told the Aftonbladet newspaper that she was not willing to break Iranian law. She said that since the only other option would be to send an all-male delegation, she was required to wear a headscarf. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven was also in Iran and said he raised human rights issues with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Masih Alinejad, an Iranian journalist and activist, posted an image of Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lovin signing a climate bill surrounded by female colleagues earlier this month next to one of several female Swedish government officials wearing headscarves and greeting Mr Rouhani. The image of Ms Lovin was widely seen as mocking a picture of Donald Trump signing an anti-abortion executive order surrounded by male aides and advisers. Women in the Swedish government \"should have condemned an equally unfair situation in Iran,\" Ms Alinejad posted to My Stealthy Freedom, a popular Facebook page she runs that encourages Iranian women to post pictures of themselves without the hijab. \"Because if you are feminists and you care about equality then you should challenge inequality everywhere,\" she told the BBC. \"They must stand for their own values.\" Is Sweden's deputy PM trolling Trump?

It also recommends that all primary school children who have not yet returned to school (primaries four to seven) should start on 22 March. That is the same day students in Years 12 to 14 are due to resume face-to-face learning. The Stormont executive will meet on Thursday to discuss Mr Weir's proposals but will need to consider them in line with advice from health officials. Mr Weir has also said he wants to scrap the current plan for students in primaries one to three, who returned to class on Monday, to revert to remote learning on 22 March. The minister argued that plan did not make \"enormous sense\" and that those year groups should be allowed to continue with face-to-face learning. Department of Health advisers previously warned against a full return of schools like in England, instead recommending a phased approach.

Aberdeen is next with its potential worst-case shortfall of \u00a382m the equivalent of \u00a3359 per resident. Perth and Kinross comes third, according to this measure, with its estimated potential shortfall of \u00a350m the equivalent of \u00a3329 for every resident. The Scottish government said it had taken \"exceptional measures\" in every area of government to deal with the challenges of Covid-19. To date, Scottish councils have received \u00a3405m in advanced payments this financial year, and the government said by the end of July this will have risen to \u00a3455m. Highland's potential \u00a396.9m gap is the fourth worst-case shortfall in the UK, after Birmingham, Essex and Manchester. Having the highest proportion of furloughed staff in Scotland, along with the loss to its tourism-dominated economy has placed extra pressure on Highland Council. Additional costs have been incurred through adapting services and providing financial support for vulnerable people and struggling businesses. Head of finance at the authority, Ed Foster, said balancing its deficit would not be possible \"without shed loads of pain\". About 230,000 people live in the Highlands, even though the area covers just under half the landmass of Scotland and a large swathe of coastal area.

His Stasi pass was found during research into the close co-operation between the KGB and Stasi. Mr Putin, then a KGB major, got it in 1985. It got him into Stasi facilities, but he may not have spied for them. In a statement on Tuesday, the Stasi Records Agency (BStU) said that Mr Putin \"received the pass so that he could carry out his KGB work in co-operation with the Stasi\". Stasi was actually the nickname for East German Ministry of State Security (MfS) agents. It was notorious for its meticulous surveillance of ordinary citizens, many of whom were pressed into spying on each other. \"Current research gives no indication that Vladimir Putin worked for the MfS,\" the BStU statement said. Mr Putin, born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg), was posted to East Germany in 1985, aged 33. His two daughters were born during that posting. He is now 66. Mr Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden up to and including December 1989, when the communist East German regime collapsed amid mass pro-democracy protests. His Stasi pass was renewed every three months, as shown by the stamps on it. It is not clear why he left the pass in the Stasi files in Dresden. He witnessed protesters occupying the Dresden Stasi headquarters, while communist security forces came close to opening fire on them, on 5 December 1989. Jubilant East Berliners had already breached the Berlin Wall in November. Mr Putin was fluent in German at the time and has said he personally calmed the Dresden crowd when they surrounded the KGB building there, warning them that it was Soviet territory. During his KGB service in Dresden Mr Putin was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1989 he was awarded a bronze medal by communist East Germany - officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR) - \"for faithful service to the National People's Army\", the Kremlin website says.

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and its offshoot al-Murabitoun have both said they were behind it but some doubt remains. Most analysts say veteran Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar was involved but until now, it was thought that the al-Murabitoun leader had split from AQIM. However the alliances of the various armed groups operating in the lawless deserts of northern Mali and Niger, and southern Algeria and Libya, are constantly changing. Some of these groups have a global jihadist ideology. Some are Tuareg separatists, others make money by trafficking drugs, people and weapons across the Sahara desert, while some offer their services to the highest bidder. Some suggest that increased pressure from French special forces deployed in Mali since 2013 may have pushed Belmokhtar back into working with al-Qaeda. Adding to the confusion, the Macina Liberation Front (MLF) has now said it was behind the attack. The MLF is a relatively new Islamist group formed by ethnic Fulanis, based in central Mali. How many attackers were there? It is not clear. Officials say two gunmen have been killed. But while some say only two attackers entered the Radisson Blu hotel, witnesses have been quoted as saying there were up to 13. Malian officials say they are looking for \"at least\" three suspects, even though they have not specified whether they are believed to have taken part in the attack, or helped plan it. The attack appears to have been well-planned, with guards quoted as saying it was timed at the end of their night shift and they had put their weapons down. The attackers drove a vehicle with diplomatic number plates, which is also evidence of careful preparation - and possible evidence that more than just two people would have been deployed to stage an attack on a high-profile target, which had been thought of as being fairly secure. Who were the attackers?

Tory Party chairman James Cleverly said Mr Corbyn was offering \"chaos, delay and uncertainty\". The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and Green Party all accepted the invitation to meet Mr Corbyn and discuss his proposals. The Labour leader also invited five Conservative MPs opposed to a no-deal exit, but none said they would be attending. One of them, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, said he was not able to make it, but was willing to meet Mr Corbyn at another time. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage criticised those attending, saying they were \"very out of touch with public opinion\" and leaving the EU without an agreement was now \"the only acceptable deal\". 'Frank discussion' Mr Corbyn has said if he wins a no-confidence vote, he will delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. The Liberal Democrats, and some potential Tory allies opposed to a no-deal exit, have indicated they won't back a plan that leads to him in No 10.

The meeting will take place on the eve of the G8 summit in Northern Ireland, set to be dominated by the Syrian conflict. Russia has been at loggerheads with the US and UK over the situation in Syria amid efforts to bring both sides in the two-year conflict, in which 80,000 people have been killed, to the negotiating table. 'Moral outrage' Mr Hague said more had to be done to save lives in Syria and the international community must be \"strong, co-ordinated and determined\" in its approach to what he described as the \"most urgent crisis\" facing the world. He said the level of repression by the government of President Bashar al-Assad and the suffering it had caused \"beggared belief\", describing its actions as a \"moral outrage\" and a \"grave threat to the wider region\". While the UK's focus remained on a diplomatic solution, he said the regime's actions were making this \"more difficult\", adding that reports of the use of chemical weapons were credible. Mr Kerry said the US was doing all it could to support the opposition to \"change the (military) balance on the ground\" but indicated that no agreement had been reached on the issue of whether opposition forces should be provided with arms.

Designs are being finalised for groves in Nottingham, Newcastle and Plymouth - and other sites will follow. The project will help improve access to nature for those in towns and cities. The idea is to try to create a UK equivalent of Japan's concept of \"Hanami\" - the annual celebration of flowers, and the coming of spring. Research carried out for the National Trust last year showed that almost half a million people live in \"grey deserts \" with no trees or green spaces nearby. Hilary McGrady, director general of the Trust, said the project was in its infancy, but \"from little acorns great things grow\". She added: \"I want this to be just as valid as planting vast tracts of trees on mountains - it's just as valid for every individual to want to plant a tree in their garden or their city. \"At the heart of it, now more than ever, people need a little bit of soft beauty in their world, and remembering why nature matters.\" According to numerous studies carried out after the first lockdown, being around nature is crucial to people's mental and physical health.

Nobody was allowed to speak to him.\" Describing the room, a Northamptonshire Police inspector who searched the home said: \"The stench of excrement was overbearing and you couldn't stay in there for any period of time.\" Prosecutor Grace Hale previously told the trial that the child was also beaten and made to sleep next to his brother on a filthy mattress with the springs sticking out. But another social worker told the court he found no sign of a lock or alarm on the child's bedroom, and the home, in Northampton, appeared to be \"spotless\" when he visited.

But inside the country, views tend to be more nuanced. As the country marks the 40th anniversary of the military coup that brought him to power, attitudes towards Gen Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime and the Socialist government of Salvador Allende that preceded it remain complex and subject to intense debate. While most Chileans abhor the human rights abuses committed under his rule, Gen Pinochet still has a small but ardent group of right-wing supporters who regard him as a hero. They say that by ousting Mr Allende on 11 September 1973, the military prevented Chile from sliding into civil war and saved the country from becoming \"another Cuba\" - a communist state. \"The armed forces saved me,\" right-wing congressman Ivan Moreira told Chilean state television this month. \"They saved me from living under a regime, a Marxist dictatorship. Pinochet saved the lives of an entire generation.\" When Gen Pinochet died in 2006, about 60,000 people turned up to file past his coffin and pay their respects. Some were in tears. Others clutched bronze busts and photographs of the general. To this day, there is a museum in Santiago honouring his memory. It contains his military uniforms, his desk, his medals and his extensive collection of toy soldiers from the different regiments of the Chilean army. Mr Moreira says the Pinochet regime has had a bad press. \"How long are we going to carry on accepting that the history of Chile is written by the pen of the left?\" he asked. Mixed views \"I'm a child of the dictatorship,\" said Karen, a Chilean I met recently in Santiago. \"I grew up with both sides of the story. My godmother is a communist but my mother is pro-Pinochet.

It has no hands or numbers. The 74-year-old says he designed the inside out clock to \"make time-keeping interesting and relevant again.\" The exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery runs until Saturday. The exhibition is the only one of its kind in the UK and showcases horological creations and innovations from around the world. Dr Taylor has now completed two Chronophage clocks with his team of craftsmen, engineers and technicians at the Huxley Bertram workshops near Cambridge. He said: \"I have turned the clock inside out as an interesting way to demonstrate time.\" The inventor, who will turn 75 later this month, continued: \"As you get older, you become more aware that time isn't on your side and every minute that passes is gone forever. \"The Chronophage shows this quite graphically as it relentlessly devours each and every minute. \"Once an hour has gone you can never get it back and the clock is basically saying don't waste time.\" Standing more than 3m high the clock was made as a tribute to the great English clockmaker John Harrison who solved the problem of longitude in the 18th Century. Harrison also invented the grasshopper escapement - a tiny internal device that releases a clock's gears at each swing of its pendulum. 'Gulps down time' Dr Taylor has modified the form of a grasshopper in his design to create a \"disturbing, mythical, eternal creature\" to devour the minutes of life. The name of the clock, the Chronophage, literally means \"time-eater\". The creature perches on top of the 1.5m face and is an integral part of the mechanics of the clock, which does not have hands or numbers. Every five minutes the clock \"corrects\" itself to remain functional. The time is shown through light slits on the clock face. Mr Taylor added: \"I wanted to depict that time is a destroyer - once a minute is gone you can't get it back. \"That's why my grasshopper is not a Dis\n\nSummary:","44":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

This has allowed them to determine the density of air in ancient times. This palaeobarometric approach, revealed at the AGU Fall Meeting, will help constrain the models that try to simulate conditions in Archaean times. Earth 2.7 billion years ago was very different from the planet we know today. It turned much faster, the Moon was closer and the Sun was much weaker. And there were no animals or plants in existence back then; the air was simply not breathable. \"There was probably quite a bit of nitrogen in the atmosphere, like today, but there was no oxygen,\" explained Sanjoy Som from Nasa's Ames Research Center. \"The oxygen was likely replaced by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. \"My palaeobarometry work cannot tell you precisely what the gases were, but it will assist modellers of atmospheric composition by giving them a constraint,\" he told BBC News. Dr Som told the AGU meeting - the largest annual gathering of Earth scientists - that the \"fossil raindrops\" were discovered in Ventersdorp in the North West Province of South Africa in the 1980s. They consist of lots of pits in the surface of a rock that started out as volcanic ash-fall. Rain tumbling on to the ash would have dug out small depressions, which were then covered over by further ash deposits and lithified, or turned to stone. We only see the imprints today because the top layers of the rock have now been eroded back. Dr Som's and colleagues' thinking is that the pits should tell us something about ancient air pressure. Gathering momentum Their starting point is that the diameters of the imprints are controlled ultimately by the top speed of the raindrops as they hit the ground. This number - the terminal velocity - is dependent on air density. In the modern atmosphere it is about 9m\/s. \"The rationale here is t\n\nSummary:","45":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The International Committee of the Red Cross warned in October that Madagascar was at risk of a plague epidemic. The disease is transmitted to humans via fleas, usually from rats. Bubonic plague, known as the Black Death when it killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, is now rare. Last year, Madagascar had 60 deaths from the plague, the world's highest recorded number. The Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed on Tuesday that tests taken from bodies in the village last week showed that they had died of the bubonic plague. The BBC's Tim Healy in the capital, Antananarivo, says health officials have now gone to the remote area to investigate. There has been a programme to exterminate rats, fleas and cockroaches in Madagascar's prisons to avoid outbreaks of the plague, which is spread because of unhygienic conditions, he says. The Pasteur Institute said there were concerns that the disease could spread to towns and cities where living standards have declined since a coup in 2009 and the ensuing political crisis. On 20 December a second round is being held of presidential elections aimed at ending the political deadlock.\n\nSummary:","47":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Such events occur about every 30 years, but the neutrino streams they produce have not been studied in detail. Dune (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) will be hosted at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. It will involve the development of the world's most high-intensity beam of neutrinos, which will travel 1,300km (800mi) underground from Fermilab towards a massive detector instrument based at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. The venture is the product of a merger between European and US projects with similar aims. The international collaboration held its inaugural meeting at Fermilab in April. \"There has been a process since last summer to prepare the ground for this collaboration, based on bringing together the US and European projects. There are now 700 people signed up,\" said Prof Stefan S\u00f6ldner-Rembold, from the University of Manchester. \"The step forward is a new collaboration with a new name that has commitments from the US, Europe, India and other regions to go forward.\" Neutrinos are one of some 17 elementary cosmic building blocks that make up the Universe. But they are also a source of intrigue for particle physicists. They are extremely light particles, with no electric charge and pass harmlessly through other matter. This property makes them very difficult to observe and is responsible for them being nicknamed \"ghost particles\". Neutrinos may also play a role in the mystery of why the Universe came to consist mostly of matter rather than antimatter. They are found in three different states, or flavours, and the particles can flip from one flavour to another.

A judge previously ruled she had been unlawfully detained from 2008 to 2009. Three appeal judges upheld that ruling saying the authorities had breached the legal principles that govern detention. The court heard how Ms Shehadeh previously lived in Saudi Arabia with her husband, from whom she is now separated. False passport She was issued with a six-month visitor visa to come to Britain on the basis that she was a Jordanian citizen and arrived in August 2002 but overstayed. Ms Shehadeh was arrested in 2005 at London's Heathrow airport with her as they were attempting to use false French passports to travel to Canada. She was subsequently convicted of using a false passport at Hillingdon Magistrates Court and sentenced to four months imprisonment with a recommendation for her deportation. Following her release, Ms Shehadeh was neither detained nor deported and went on to make an asylum claim which was rejected in 2007. In January 2008, she was flown to Jordan but on arrival told immigration officials that she was Palestinian and as a result was refused entry to the country. In July of that year, the Jordanian embassy told Home Office officials that Ms Shehadeh was not one of their citizens and had only been issued with a temporary travel document by the country's authorities. It was then proposed that Ms Shehadeh be detained while her case was considered. This involved detention for 12 months from August 2008. After her release in 2009, Ms Shehadeh brought a case against immigration officials at the Court of Session in Edinburgh for wrongful detention.

It's 30-odd floors up at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in a corner - but not very spacious - office at the Squire Patton Boggs law firm. Cohen's office is decked out with paraphernalia from his time at the Trump Organization and on Trump's presidential campaign, as well as from superhero movies - Thor's hammer, Captain America's shield. Also hard to miss - a nearly full-length impressionist-style painting of Cohen himself at the press secretary's podium in the White House briefing room. Cohen has remained in Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, during ups and downs at the Trump Organization and on the campaign. But as Cohen has been named a subject of a federal investigation in New York, his relations with Donald Trump have deteriorated. The protector Cohen, 51, had prided himself in going above and beyond the line of duty as the president's personal lawyer. He considered himself Trump's protector. He'll do anything for him, telling Vanity Fair last September he'd \"take a bullet\" for the president. The day before the FBI raid, Cohen tweeted a month-old story about him with a Joyce Maynard quote: \"A person who deserves my loyalty receives it\" followed by his own pledge: \"I will always protect our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump #MAGA\". Cohen is the son of an immigrant who escaped a Nazi concentration camp in Poland. He grew up in Long Island, right outside of New York City, before attending American University in Washington and Cooley Law School in western Michigan. Back in New York, Cohen worked at a law firm, married an Ukrainian immigrant, ran a successful taxi business and made a failed run for New York City Council, all before entering Trump's orbit. Cohen was introduced to Donald Trump by his son, Donald Jr, in 2006.

The authors said the findings were \"very encouraging\" Other experts said techniques with bone marrow stem cells were more advanced and that bigger trials were needed. The scientists say this is the first reported case of cardiac stem cells being used as a treatment in people after earlier studies had shown benefits in animals. Improvement The preliminary trial was on patients with heart failure who were having heart bypass surgery. During the operation, a piece of heart tissue, from the right atrial appendage, was taken. While the patient was being sewn up, researchers isolated cardiac stem cells from the sample and cultured them until they had about two million stem cells for each patient. The cells were injected about 100 days later. Doctors measured how efficiently the heart was pumping using the left ventricle ejection fraction - what percentage of blood was leaving one of the heart's main chamber with every beat. In the 14 patients given the treatment, the percentage increased from 30.3% at the beginning of the trial, to 38.5% after four months. There was no change in the ejection fraction in the seven patients who were not injected with stem cells. Dr Roberto Bolli, one of the researchers from the University of Louisville, told the BBC: \"We believe these finding are very significant. \"Our results indicate that cardiac stem cells can markedly improve the contractile function of the heart.\" Heart v bone The heart is not the only source of potentially useful stem cells.

In December, Sadiq Khan announced he would raise council tax by the maximum 9% to help fund policing. The GLA Conservatives said Mr Khan should \"get his own house in order\" instead of taking from businesses. Last year there were 132 murders in London, the highest number since 2008. Mr Khan said: \"Keeping Londoners safe is my number-one priority.\" Conservative assembly member Gareth Bacon, who chairs the budget and performance committee, said the funding was \"welcome and desperately needed\". \"As long as the Mayor continues to spend an eye-watering amount of waste and spin, Londoners simply won't believe him when he claims that his priority is to keep us safe,\" he added. Since 2010, central government funding to police forces across England and Wales has been cut by almost a third, in real terms. Mr Khan said he was \"determined to do everything in my power to support the Met Police and tackle the complex causes of crime\". \"The government has forced the Met to make \u00a3850m of cuts, resulting in officer numbers dropping to a dangerous 15-year low of less than 30,000,\" he added.

But it also revealed that no university had been forced to cut its fees during negotiations. Ministers said far more money would now be spent on attracting poorer students. It comes after it was announced that eight out of 10 universities in Wales will charge maximum tuition fees of \u00a39,000 per year for some or all their courses. Every university wanting to charge more than \u00a36,000 in fees has had to have its proposals to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds approved by Offa. Known as access agreements, these include fee-waivers, bursaries and outreach activities like summer schools and targeted trips to primary and secondary schools to encourage students from disadvantaged backgrounds to apply. University fee levels are contingent on these being approved by the watchdog. Director of Fair Access Sir Graeme Davies said the process of negotiating these agreements had been \"rigorous and robust\". He added that 52 of the 141 institutions' original plans for widening access and raising fees were not challenging enough and were sent back to be re-worked. \"In some cases we were unhappy with the first draft we received but institutions responded positively,\" he added. Offa said universities had improved their targets and promised to spend an extra \u00a321m on access measures overall, but no fee levels were reduced as a result of these negotiations. Earlier this year, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg declared that elite universities would not be given permission by Offa to charge higher fees unless they could prove more students from poorer backgrounds would get in.

But some patients have not yet received those letters. The Royal College of GPs apologised for the delay, saying the letters would be sent \"as soon as possible\". The Health and Social Care Board said GPs had been asked to use their own clinical judgement to identify \"extremely vulnerable\" patients. A spokesperson said it was a \"complicated process\". Dr Alan Stout, from the British Medical Association NI, said it was \"a big ask of GPs during a very difficult and busy time\". But he said there was an urgency to the project, which is UK-wide, and said \"these letters are very important and go to our most vulnerable and at risk group of patients\". \"The only way to obtain an accurate list and contact details of these patients was through the GP computer system [and] GPs would be able to readily identify and know any patient that might have been missed,\" he added. Dr Laurence Dorman, RCGP chairman, said \"shielding was a big deal\" and said any delays were due to the fact \"doctors want to do this right\". He said staffing levels in some GP surgeries had been \"hit hard by Covid-19\", which had affected their ability to fulfil requirements.

It wants the money brought back to Malaysia. There has been a series of sensational revelations about 1MDB that have threatened Mr Najib's position. Documents leaked in July indicated that Mr Najib received some $700m in his private accounts from entities linked to the fund. Mr Najib denies doing anything wrong. He says the money was a donation from the Middle East. The fund has debts of 42bn ringgit ($11.5bn) and is the subject of several investigations by different authorities, including the Central Bank. The bank's statement comes just a day after the country's attorney general, appointed to look into the matter by the prime minister, said he had seen a report of the central bank's investigation and judged that 1MDB officials had not committed any offence. The central bank said 1MDB had gained permits for investment abroad, but these were based on inaccurate or incomplete disclosure of information.

Mr Johnson said that during this time, he'd helped \"unite our capital, the greatest city on earth\" and listed a series of achievements. \"We cut the murder rate by 50%\" During Mr Johnson's time as mayor, the homicide rate in London fell from 22 per million to 12 per million people - about a 50% cut. That includes murder and manslaughter. There were 163 homicides in the capital in the year he took office, and 109 the year he left. We're talking about small overall numbers, so relatively modest changes can make a big difference in percentage terms. It was also falling during his predecessor's second term having reached a peak of 211 homicides a year - or about 30 per million people - in 2003-04. The rate also fell across the rest of the country between 2008 and 2016, although not as dramatically. \"We cut road traffic fatalities by 50%\" On traffic deaths, he's more or less right. Transport for London figures show that between 2005 and 2009 the average annual number of fatalities in Greater London was 211. In 2016 (the year Boris Johnson left office) there were 116 fatalities in Greater London - a 45% drop. During the same period, across Great Britain, traffic fatalities fell by 36% - according to figures from the Department for Transport. \"We outbuilt Labour with more than 100,000 affordable homes\" The figures for completed affordable homes are published by the Greater London Authority (GLA) for April to March each year, which is reasonably close to the mayoral terms, which run from early May. Between the beginning of April 2008 and the end of March 2016 there were 101,525 affordable homes completed in London, of which the GLA contributed to 94,001. More affordable homes were indeed built during his two terms than during the two terms of his Labour predecessor. But the definition of affordable housing was broadened in 2011, with the inclusion of affordable-rent housing,\n\nSummary:","59":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It starts in the middle of the afternoon, with the words: \"Town and Country do your best. But in this parish I must rest.\" The hurling can last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. More news from Cornwall The winner is the person who carries the ball across the parish boundary or to their own \"goal\". This year's champion, townsman Marco Ciarleglio, carried the ball to his team's goal in under 30 minutes. The hurling starts at 16:30 and is thrown into the crowd by a person chosen by the previous \"winner of the ball\" from a stepladder in the town's Market Square. The town goal is the base of an old Celtic cross and the country goal is a shallow stone trough, with the \"pitch\" measuring about 20 square miles but the teams can also win by carrying it out of the parish. The game is considered by many to be Cornwall's national game along with Cornish wrestling. At one time it was played across Cornwall, but only takes place now in towns like St Columb Major and St Ives. After a day of hurling another tradition is the \"drinking the silver ball\". In the evening the ball is dipped into a mug of the winner's drink. The town even has a pub called the Silver Ball. A rematch takes place on the second Saturday after the competition - which is on 24 February this year. The winner can choose to keep the silver ball, although they have to pay for a replacement.\n\nSummary:","60":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Home Office said steps had been taken to ensure the camp was \"safe\". More than 100 residents tested positive during an outbreak earlier this year, a remote preliminary hearing was told. 'Vulnerable' Mr Justice Chamberlain ruled claims by five asylum seekers that the barracks were inadequate should be considered in a judicial review. Lawyers also argue the dormitory accommodation lacks privacy and adequate toilet facilities. Tom Hickman QC, representing three asylum seekers, said many residents were vulnerable and had \"mental health problems, which arise from the circumstances in which they left their country of origin and their journey to the UK\". The five asylum seekers bringing the case have since been rehoused, but 63 men remain at the site, which once housed 400 people, the court heard. PHE told the Home Office \"dormitories were not suitable\" but that, if they must be used, there should be two metres between beds and six-people dormitories should be treated as \"one bubble and kept together and away from others as much as possible,\" the judge said. But he said the advice was not followed. Lisa Giovanetti QC, for the home secretary, said PHE's outbreak control team would meet Home Office officials on Thursday to give advice on \"how to safely manage the Covid outbreak at Napier going forwards\". \"The secretary of state is doing everything in the meantime pending the hearing to make sure the accommodation is safe and adequate in the coming weeks,\" she added. After the hearing, a spokesman for the Home Office said: \"The government provides safe, warm and secure accommodation with three nutritious meals served a day, all paid for by the taxpayer. \"Napier has previously accommodated Army personnel and it is wrong to say it is not adequate for asylum seekers. \n\nSummary:","62":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

His staunchly Catholic parents rejected his homosexuality, and he left home. But Gajdics found himself struggling with deep depression and with feeling alienated and estranged, and his doctor referred him to a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist centred on Gajdics' sexuality as the problem, telling him that abuse he suffered as a child created a \"false notion\" that he was homosexual. \"So the goal in my therapy would be to work through my 'trauma' and therefore I would revert to my innate heterosexuality,\" says Gajdics. \"Everything about my therapy became focused to do that.\" The treatments grew increasingly intense. He was prescribed a cocktail of psychiatric medications - antidepressants, a sedative and more - and told they were necessary \"to silence the noise\" of his homosexuality. The young Canadian man spent six years under the psychiatrist's care, eventually moving into a house with other patients, \"isolated from the world, definitely not talking to family or former friends, which was prohibited\". He finally left the treatment, got off the medications, and sued the doctor for medical malpractice. One of the grounds for his lawsuit, which was settled out of court in 2003, was that the psychiatrist had tried to treat Gajdics' homosexuality as a disease. For Gajdics, part of the process of reclaiming his life after that experience was to speak out against conversion therapy - sometimes also called \"sexual reorientation\", \"reparative\", or \"gay cure\" therapy. He recognises what he went through was an extreme form of the practice, but the intended goal of any form of conversion therapy is the same: to attempt to change an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity. Conversion therapy has been widely discredited by major psychotherapy and medical associations in many countries, including Canada, the US and the UK, and is opposed by the World Health Organisation and the \n\nSummary:","63":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It let someone hunting for bugs become the joint owner of hundreds of wallets. However, when the unidentified person tried to reverse their mistake they stopped the original owners of the wallets getting access too. Find and fix In a statement, Parity Technologies said all wallets created after 20 July this year were affected by the mistake. It provided a link to a separate page on which Ether holders could check to see if their wallet was among this vulnerable batch. Parity expressed regret over the \"great deal of stress and confusion\" the incident had caused. It added: \"We continue to investigate the situation and are exploring all possible implications and solutions.\" It is not yet clear whether Parity will be able to rectify the mistake. This is because the unidentified person who triggered the problem used a function that \"suicided\" code that could have been used to resurrect the wallets. Estimates of exactly how much of Ethereum's coins has been frozen vary widely. Low estimates put the figure at $150m but others suggest it could be as high as $300m. The bug was triggered while an unnamed developer was looking through the Parity code for ways that it could be exploited. Only wallets created after 20 July are affected because they use an updated version of Parity's wallet program issued to fix another bug that led to $30m of Ethereum coins being stolen. Ethereum is a crypto-currency similar to Bitcoin that uses a large network of computers to verify transactions and generate new coins. Currently, one Ether digital coin is worth about $314.\n\nSummary:","65":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The 29-year-old victim's van had backfired and the soldier thought it was an attack. Coroner Brian Sherrard had previously found the killing was \"not necessary, reasonable or proportionate\". On Wednesday he lifted an anonymity order that had prevented Mr McVitie's identity being revealed to Belfast Coroner's Court. He said the paratrooper ran after the van with the \"honestly held belief\" that shots had been fired at the police station. But he said the soldier's decision to open fire was not justified and, even if the occupants had been armed there were non-fatal options open to Sgt McVitie. Mr Thornton was an unarmed civilian who had no connection to any paramilitary group. In 2012, the government wrote a letter of apology to Mr Thornton widow, Mary, confirming that her husband had been an \"innocent man\".

But the Scottish cyclist was 290 yards short of the world record of 22 miles and 150 yards. Last year, 35-year-old Beaumont broke the record for cycling around the world. He completed the 18,000-mile route in 79 days. His round the world in 80 days adventure was inspired by Victorian-era novelist Jules Verne. For his latest challenge he reverted to Victorian-era transport. The Penny Farthing was one of the first contraptions to be called a bicycle and was popular in the late 19th Century. There have been very few attempts to break the Penny Farthing time trial records since they were set in the 1880s. The bike went out of fashion when more efficient and more convenient bicycles were made. Before the attempt, Beaumont said the bicycle he was using was \"pretty much unchanged\" from how they would have been in the 1880s. The front wheel was a whopping 56in (1.42 metres) and there was still no air in the tyres, no brakes and no gears or chain, he said. During his record attempt he had eight other riders on the machines, who acted as pacemakers. However, he still did not beat the world record set in 1886 in Massachusetts by American William Rowe. What is a Penny Farthing? It was one of the first machines to be called a bicycle. Its name came from its large front wheel and smaller back wheel, which resembled the largest and smallest coins of the time. It was popular in the late 19th Century in Europe and the United States. The machine had solid rubber tyres, a cast iron frame and pedals attached directly to the wheel hub. Round the world In September last year, Beaumont broke the world record for cycling around the world - by 44 days. Beaumont, from Perthshire, arrived in Paris one day ahead of schedule having cycled the 18,000-mile route in 78 days. He was on his bike for more than 16 hours a day and only slept for five hours each night.

Based on Jean Hanff Korelitz's 2014 novel You Should Have Known, The Undoing tells of a paediatric oncologist suspected of killing the mother of one of his young patients. His arrest and trial lead his wife, a successful psychotherapist, to have doubts about the man she married and wonder how many secrets he's keeping from her and their son. The Undoing was directed by Susanne Bier, the Danish film-maker who achieved notable success in 2016 with her BBC adaptation of John le Carre's The Night Manager. Here are five reasons why the show has got people talking.

Cymdeithas has accused BBC Wales of \"betrayal\" because of its \"co-operation with the UK government\". Around 200 people demonstrated outside BBC Wales' Carmarthen office at the weekend. Menna Machreth, Cymdeithas's media spokesperson, said: \"The discussions at the moment are being held behind closed doors about the future of the channel and we think that is very undemocratic. \"They are ignoring the opinions of MPs who haven't even voted on these plans yet and ignoring the opinions of the Welsh Affairs Committee as well. \"So that's why it is so urgent that we're campaigning now.\" S4C faces a 25% budget cut by 2015 under funding changes by Chancellor George Osborne.

About 900 were evacuated as the landslide struck on Sunday. Authorities said a huge man-made mound of earth and construction debris lost stability and collapsed. The city is one of China's biggest and is a major industrial centre. It is situated in the southern province of Guangdong, across the mainland border from Hong Kong. The landslide has blanketed a vast area of 380,000 sq m (455,000 sq yards) covering it with up to 10m (32ft) of mud at an industrial park, Shenzhen's emergency management office said on its official microblog. State news agency Xinhua said that the landslide caused an explosion at a natural gas pipeline. Workers have cleaned up about 400m of damaged pipeline and are now repairing it. China's history of industrial accidents China's land and resources ministry said in a statement on its website that initial investigations showed the landslide happened when a huge mound of soil, cement chunks and other construction waste became unstable. \"Because the mound was very large, and the angle of its slope was overly steep, this led to it losing stability and collapsing,\" it said. People's Daily said the mound had accumulated at a stone quarry that had been converted into a dumping area with its entrance and exit facing an industrial district. Residents evacuated from the surrounding area described hearing loud roars when the landslide happened. Amateur footage of the incident broadcast on state television showed waves of red soil quickly engulfing and crushing buildings. A video taken by an eyewitness and posted online by Beijing Daily newspaper shows plumes of soil shooting up in the air as the mound of earth collapses.

She said she would have spoken out if she had seen anything wrong. Mr Higgins, 65, denies 50 counts of indecent assault against teenage boys between 1971 and 1996. Mrs Higgins told Winchester Crown Court hundreds of boys stayed with her on weekends for matches or training if they were far from home. The boys would \"clamber to be around\" her husband in their lounge, sitting beside him or at his feet. Alistair MacDonald QC, defending, asked if she had seen anything \"abnormal or strange\" about the seating arrangements. \"No, I would have said something,\" Mrs Higgins replied. She said on three occasions she saw her husband with his arm around a boy at their home. Each time Mr Higgins was breaking the news of a death in the boy's family, she told the jury. Mrs Higgins said she chose which boys could stay using a rota system and no trainees stayed if she was away. \"They were coming into our care. I looked after them as if they were my own son,\" she said. Mrs Higgins said some boys had been \"cajoled\" into giving evidence against her husband in a previous trial in which he was acquitted of all charges. She said a former Southampton youth coach, Dave Merrington, had a \"vendetta\" against her husband at that time. Under cross-examination, Mrs Higgins was asked about soap-water massages which her husband gave to trainees. Prosecutor Adam Feest QC asked her: \"Did your husband ever disclose to you that he got sexually aroused when massaging naked boys?\" \"Of course he wouldn't massage a boy naked. Why would he? He's a football coach,\" Mrs Higgins told the court. She told jurors she had never \"to this very day\" gone to bed before her husband, leaving him alone with boys in the lounge.

The auditor general for Wales, Huw Vaughan Thomas, said an initial probe raised a number of questions that warrant further in-depth investigation. The Welsh government declined to comment. The land was bought for about \u00a321m by South Wales Land Developments Ltd in March. It was bought from a public organisation which operates at arms length from the Welsh government called the Regeneration Investment Fund for Wales (RIFW). 'Claw back' Land near Cardiff was sold weeks before a council report on potential housing sites which could boost its value. The Welsh government says the sale included \"claw back\" arrangements in case the land rose in value. The claw back contracts mean the taxpayer will share in any large increase in the price of the land due to planning decisions. The Welsh government has refused to say what those claw backs are, but industry sources say it is not normally higher than 50% in deals of this type. Initially, the auditor general began an investigation and included it in his ongoing audit of the Welsh government. But Mr Thomas said the initial investigation had \"identified a number of questions and concerns which I now consider warrant further in-depth audit investigation\". \"I have therefore determined to undertake a value for money study into all aspects of the sale of these assets by RIFW. \"In broad terms, this study will be seeking to answer the question 'was the disposal handled in a way that ensured good value for money?'\" He added: \"As is usual with my value for money studies, I intend to present my findings to the Public Accounts Committee in the form of a published report.\" Property portfolio A spokesman for the Welsh government said: \"As a Wales Audit Office review is under way it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.\" When BBC Wales originally reported on the Wales Audit Office investigation earlier this month, Langley Davies, who is managing \n\nSummary:","77":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Which? claimed that in some cases the promotions could be in breach of consumer law.

But according to Which? the day after the sale the price dropped to \u00a3677 per person - a saving of \u00a3230 for two people sharing. In October the Caribbean resort Sandals advertised an all-inclusive break to Jamaica from \u00a31,465 per person. Yet the day after the \"mega sale\" ended, the price dropped by \u00a350 a person. Virgin Holidays told Which? that it would never intentionally advertise anything misleading. It added: \"We're always looking to secure the best possible value for our customers - and should we be able to obtain better offers from our suppliers, these savings will be passed on to benefit the customer.\" Unique Caribbean Holidays - which represents Sandals in the UK - said the company does not intentionally \"pressure sell\", or create false \"book by\" dates.

But on Thursday a judge issued a temporary stay on the suspension citing concerns over free-speech rights. A lawsuit filed by the girl's family against the school is still pending. The case began on 16 September after Aela posted notes in two bathrooms at Cape Elizabeth High School reading: \"There's a rapist in the school and you know who it is.\" After another student brought the note to school administrators, they investigated and identified Aela through camera footage. She and two other girls were suspended for three days on 4 October after officials determined the behaviour constituted bullying. The district's investigation revealed that one male student felt targeted by the notes and was ostracised by his peers, forcing him to miss classes. In an interview with CBS, Aela said her note was never intended to single out anyone as a rapist, but was rather highlighting the issue of sexual assault. The Bangor Daily News reports that after the notes were posted, \"the rumour mill spun out of control, creating fear in the high school\". The principal, Jeffrey Shedd, conducted 47 interviews and determined the school was safe, according to the newspaper. He previously said the three suspended girls had \"made a really bad choice\", despite meaning well. The suspension led about 50 students in the 550-pupil school to walk out in protest on 7 October. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the school district near Portland, Maine's largest city. It argued that the girl had simply taken a \"public stance as an ally for victims and survivors of sexual violence\". In the order temporarily blocking the suspension on Thursday, US District Court Judge Lance Walker cited \"a fair likelihood\" that the suspension would ultimately be overturned on the grounds of free speech and Title IX - a federal law that bans gender discrimination in \n\nSummary:","79":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

And two years earlier, Kenneth Cole, boss of the eponymous clothing and accessories brand, tweeted this howler during the Egyptian revolution: \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor is they heard our new spring collection is now online...\" The twitterstorm that followed forced him to make a swift apology in which he admitted that his tweet had been \"insensitive\" and \"absolutely inappropriate\". So perhaps it is no wonder only 10% of the chief executives running the world's 50 largest companies regularly tweet, according to a survey by marketing consultancy Weber Shandwick. The risk of contracting foot-in-mouth disease seems just too high for many. 'Cynicism' But Robert Glaesener, boss of Twitter analytics firm Talkwalker, believes the fact that most of them are aged 50-to-60 has more to do with it - they're simply too old to understand social media fully, he says. Even tweeting extrovert Sir Richard Branson, who has more than six million followers and epitomises the consumer-friendly, approachable boss, is prone to the occasional gaffe. His tweet on the day of the fatal Virgin Galactic crash last year began: \"Space is hard - but worth it.\" This was considered insensitive by some commentators and led others to question the legitimacy of his space tourism mission. \"There is a real danger that something that is well meant can end up creating cynicism on social media,\" warns Mr Glaesener. \"While most of the responses to that tweet were positive and supportive, there were also negative responses with people questioning his motives.\" But leaving Twitter campaigns to your corporate PR team sometimes isn't any better.

BA has not revealed any technical details about the breach, but cyber-security experts have some suggestions of possible methods used. Names, email addresses and credit card details including card numbers, expiry dates and three-digit CVV codes were stolen by the hackers. At first glance, the firm's statement appears to give no details about the hack, but by \"reading between the lines\", it is possible to infer some potential attack routes, says cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey. Take BA's specification of the exact times and dates between which the attack occurred - 22:58 BST, 21 August 2018 until 21:45 BST, 5 September 2018 inclusive. \"They very carefully worded the statement to say anybody who made a card payment between those two dates is at risk,\" says Prof Woodward. \"It looks very much like the details were nabbed at the point of entry - someone managed to get a script on to the website.\" This means that as customers typed in their credit card details, a piece of malicious code on the BA website or app may have been furtively extracting those details and sending them to someone else. Prof Woodward points out that this is an increasing problem for websites that embed code from third-party suppliers - it's known as a supply chain attack. Third parties may supply code to run payment authorisation, present ads or allow users to log into external services, for example. Such an attack appeared to affect Ticketmaster recently, after an on-site customer service chatbot was labelled as the potential cause of a breach affecting up to 40,000 UK users. Without further details, there is no way of knowing for sure if something similar has happened to BA. Prof Woodward points out it may just as easily have been a company insider who tampered with the website and app's code for malicious purposes. Because CVV data, the three-digit security code on credit and debit cards, was also taken in the attack, it is indeed li\n\nSummary:","82":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The force said its off-road bike team had stopped a rider and seized his bike as he left the quarry. Patrols and targeted operations are being stepped up in the area, it added. The police team carried out eight targeted operations in the area in December and seized vehicles worth \u00a332,000. Six riders were also reported for driving offences and 12 were issued with warnings, police said. Insp Adrian Luscombe, from the Doncaster West Neighbourhood Policing Team, said there had been an increase in damage and dangerous driving in recent weeks. \"This type of offence is heartbreaking for farmers and it's also really costly for them to repair.\" Aerial photographs show the impact the bikers have had on fields in the area, Insp Luscombe said. \"That's damage being caused solely by off-road bikers accessing the land when they shouldn't be,\" he added. South Yorkshire Police said the off-road bike team was supporting targeted operations and regular patrols in the area. \"If you're caught and stopped with no insurance or licence, you will lose your bike and you could be reported on summons and have a trip to court,\" Insp Luscombe said. \"When you're riding over a field to get your kicks on your bike, you're destroying someone's livelihood, the crops that put food on their table and yours.\" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The university's chancellor, Lord Patten, has stated publicly that it should remain. Similar views were also expressed by Professor Louise Richardson when she became the university's new vice chancellor this week. But many students still can't get over the statue's presence and feel it's an uncomfortable reminder of the past. \"I feel the same way that I would feel if I saw a statue of Hitler in Germany,\" says Ntokozo Qwabe, a 24 year old South African student, and one of many campaigning for it to come down. Back in Spring 2015, a related \"Rhodes Must Fall\" campaign in South Africa was spearheaded on Twitter, and resulted in the removal of another statue in Cape Town University. Qwabe is championing the same campaign in Oxford, hoping for a similar effect. Rhodes was a revered figure in the days of the British Empire. But today many regard him as a British colonialist who benefited from Africa's resources at the expense of many South Africans. He also founded an eponymous country - Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe and Zambia. Rhodes believed that the English were the master race, and was once quoted as saying: \"I contend that we are the first race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit, the better it is for the human race.\" Educated at Oxford, Rhodes left a large sum of his fortune to the university to fund scholarships for students around the world to study there - hence the statue which adorns the front of Oriel College. For Qwabe and those who support the movement, it's a permanent reminder of Britain's brutal colonial history. Tadiwa Madenga is 22 years old and studying Women's Studies at Oxford University. She's from Zimbabwe and she says she's part of the first generation of her family to be born free.

But some social clubs were continuing to serve alcohol without food after their local councils told them this was permitted. A club in Preston said its business would now \"slowly die\". Alan Hamilton from St Gregory's Catholic and Social Club said he now faced an \"uncertain future\" after \"a confusing message\". Local councils had said the tier three regulations did not include private members' clubs because they operate under a different law which means, in effect, the members own the drink already. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the legislation had been changed so that it included the provision of alcohol on a premises, not just its sale. Tim Tomlinson from Lancaster Pub Watch said it was right that rules \"should be the same\" and \"it has to be consistent\". He said: \"There is no rational reason why a working men's club would have a different set of rules to the pub next door. \"You'll just get thousands of people queuing up to join the working men's club and they'll be chock-a-block.\" 'Expected' Mr Hamilton said no government grant was available for his business but he still had to pay \"expenses like rent, utility cost, and wages.\" \"When your income is below your expenses you are slowly dying,\" he added. He said it was \"a bitter disappointment\" and there was a \"distinct possibility the club would have to close down for good\". There are thousands of members' clubs across England, including Conservative clubs, working men's clubs and sports clubs. Councils in Wirral, Preston and Fylde had all advised social clubs that the discrepancy exists because they hold club premises certificates and not premises licences. But the government has since clarified that social clubs cannot sell alcohol on the premises unless they serve substantial meals.

The request came amid criticism over executive salaries at the firm. Top directors at the holiday company have been paid a combined \u00a320m in salaries and bonuses since 2014. Why are the directors under scrutiny? Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned whether directors should pay themselves \"large sums of money\" as their businesses go \"down the tubes\". \"I think the questions we've got to ask ourselves now [are]: How can this thing be stopped from happening in the future? \"How can we make sure that tour operators take proper precautions with their business models where you don't end up with a situation where the taxpayer, the state, is having to step in and bring people home?\" Mrs Leadsom said the official receiver's inquiry would look into the conduct of the firm's top directors. \"I ask that the investigation by the official receiver looks, not only at the conduct of directors immediately prior to and at insolvency, but also at whether any action by directors has caused detriment to creditors or to the pension schemes,\" she wrote in her letter to the Insolvency Service.

'Energetic partner' The G7 meeting in Biarritz - a get together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson will meet Mr Tusk on Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting and spell out his absolute commitment to getting the UK out of the EU by that date. Ahead of the summit he insisted the UK would be an \"energetic partner\" on the world stage after Brexit. Mr Johnson said: \"Some people question the democratic decision this country has made, fearing that we will retreat from the world. Some think Britain's best days are behind us. \"To those people I say: you are gravely mistaken.\" His comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could see Britain as a \"junior partner\" in a position of \"historic vassalisation\". Mr Trump, who has consistently praised Mr Johnson, has predicted a speedy US-UK trade deal after Brexit. But the British side is adamant it wants to secure the right deal rather than a quick agreement.

The Guyrarokas are part of the Guarani people in western Brazil. According to the Public Prosecution Office in Brazil, the tribe began to be expelled from its ancestral lands, near the Paraguay border, in 1927. The authorities demarcated their lands only in 2009. Mr Delfino, a prosecutor for Mato Grosso do Sul state, said that the allowing them access to their land was not enough after so many years. \"When they go back, most of the land will have been cleared of its forests. The soil will be exhausted by decades of intensive agriculture.\" He told Agencia Brasil, the Brazilian government official news agency, that \"the Indians will need the financial resources they lack to make their land productive and their environment sustainable again.\" The law suit against the Brazilian Federal Government and Funai - the national indigenous agency - was filed in April but only made public now. Mr Delfino wants the compensation money to be used in policies that benefit Guarani communities in Mato Grosso do Sul. Campaign group Survival International says this is the first of a series of such demands for Guarani communities. The Guarani are Brazil's largest indigenous minority, with around 46,000 members living in seven states. Many others live in neighbouring Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina.

It was alleged music was lost in the fire. Most later dropped their claims when it was demonstrated they suffered no loss. Only Tom Petty's ex-wife Jane was still involved but a judge on Monday said she had not filed enough evidence. Judge John A Kronstadt, sitting in a California court, dismissed the claim. One part of the dismissal stated that Tom Petty didn't technically own the masters that were lost - they belonged to his former record label, MCA, which is now owned by UMG. 'Greatest music' The group of claimants had originally asked for $100m (\u00a382m) in damages. The case was brought following a New York Times investigation which alleged that hundreds of thousands of master recordings, protection copies, unreleased music and other materials had burned in a massive warehouse fire in 2008. Several artists alleged UMG was in breach of contract after not sharing a settlement it reached with insurers and accused the record company of not doing enough to prevent the fire. In a statement, UMG said: \"As we have said all along, the New York Times Magazine articles at the root of this litigation were stunning in their overstatement and inaccuracy. \"As always, we remain focused on partnering with artists to release the world's greatest music.\" In a statement, Jake Silverstein, the editor of the New York Times Magazine, said: \"We stand by Jody Rosen's reporting.

His Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) has been in power for 30 years. With nearly all the votes counted, there is a possibility the opposition could form a technocratic government. The Democratic Front (DF) is the largest opposition party but its right-wing policies and close relations with Serbia and Russia are not shared by other parties. President Djukanovic says he and his party will respect the results and the \"free democratic will\" of Montenegro's people but will wait for the final outcome. What bolstered the opposition? With 99.65% of the vote counted, the DPS had won 35.1% while the DF had 32.51%. Peace is Our Nation, an opposition alliance of centrist parties, was in third place with 12.5% and another alliance led by the green United Reform Action party had 5.53%. Divisions over the powerful Serbian Orthodox Church dominated the campaign. There have been months of protests since a law was adopted in December allowing the state to seize religious assets when their historical ownership could not be proven. The Church urged people to vote against the DPS. What's the background? Montenegro remained allied in a union with Serbia until 2006 - long after the former Yugoslavia dissolved into independent states. President Djukanovic, 58, has been in charge since 1990. In more recent years, he was instrumental in securing Montenegro's accession to Nato in June 2017 and has been leading ongoing efforts to gain membership to the European Union. Montenegrins who identify as ethnic Serbs account for about a third of the country's 630,000 population, according to the latest census data. And as the majority of Montenegrins are members of the Church, its influence is considerable.

But the Pentagon said that Baghdadi's fate remained unclear. The IS chief allegedly broke a months-long silence in May by releasing an audio message in which he urged Muslims to emigrate to the \"caliphate\" that the group has proclaimed in areas of Syria and Iraq. But his only public appearance on video has been to deliver a sermon in Mosul after IS took the northern Iraqi city last year. Before then, there were only two authenticated photos of him. The IS chief also appears to wear a mask to address his commanders, earning the nickname \"the invisible sheikh\". But Baghdadi - a nom de guerre, rather than his real name - has good reason to maintain a veil of mystery, says the BBC's Security Correspondent, Frank Gardner. One of his predecessors, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi who headed the most violent jihadist group in Iraq until his death, was a high-profile showman whose secret location was eventually tracked down. He was killed in a US bombing raid in 2006. He may be a shadowy figure, but the organisation he leads is pulling in thousands of new recruits and has become one of the most cohesive militias in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. Highly organised Baghdadi is believed to have been born in Samarra, north of Baghdad, in 1971. Reports suggest he was a cleric in a mosque in the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003. Some believe he was already a militant jihadist during the rule of Saddam Hussein. Others suggest he was radicalised during the four years he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained. He emerged as the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, one of the groups that later became Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), in 2010, and rose to prominence during the attempted merger with al-Nusra Front in Syria.

The Metropolitan Police told the BBC it \"spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well\". In a statement, it said \"there was no cause for police action\". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said: \"No comment\". Mr Johnson refused to answer questions as he arrived at Birmingham ahead of the first of the Conservative Party's leadership membership hustings. Earlier, a neighbour of Ms Symonds in Camberwell, south London, told the Guardian they had heard a woman screaming followed by \"slamming and banging\". The paper said the neighbour was inside their own flat when they recorded the alleged altercation. 'No offences or concerns' It said that in the recording - heard by the newspaper, but not by the BBC - Mr Johnson was refusing to leave the flat and told the woman to \"get off\" his laptop, before there was a loud crashing noise. Ms Symonds is allegedly heard saying the MP had ruined a sofa with red wine: \"You just don't care for anything because you're spoilt.

The defence witness said this may have impaired Mr Hill's decision making. Mr Hill, 54, denies 11 counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The 1950s Hawker Hunter he was flying crashed on to the A27 in Sussex and exploded on 22 August 2015. Dr Lupa also told the court the plane's glass cockpit was \"like a greenhouse\" on the warm summer's day and the temperature inside \"could be a factor\". He wrote a report for the defence that concluded the level of G-force experienced by Mr Hill during his display may have led to cognitive impairment caused by cerebral hypoxia, the court heard. \"If cognitive impairment did occur the most likely effect would be an impairment of judgement and decision making,\" he said. The prosecution allege Mr Hill committed to a manoeuvre despite flying too low and too slow. Defence counsel Karim Khalil QC earlier argued Mr Hill was cognitively impaired and \"unable to properly and fully control the aircraft\". 'A credible explanation' Dr Lupa said it was \"difficult to conceive\" why a pilot would deliberately choose to do a manoeuvre known to be dangerous at low altitude unless a \"serious misjudgement occurred\". \"It's unknown if cognitive impairment may have occurred because of cerebral hypoxia but it is a credible explanation,\" he told the court. Dr Lupa said there was no evidence Mr Hill suffered a loss of consciousness, known as G-loc, or a lesser condition known as A-loc, where \"the lights are on but nobody's home\". However, he told the court that \"measurable hypoxia can occur at levels significantly below those that can cause G-loc or A-loc\".

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK would leave on 31 October with or without a deal. The new PM said he would prefer to get a deal with the EU, but he recognised this \"may not happen\". Theresa May's Brexit deal was rejected three times by MPs - with many concerned over the Irish border backstop plan. Mr Johnson has urged the EU to make changes to the deal but it has repeatedly said the withdrawal agreement cannot be renegotiated. 'Concern about democracy' Leaving without a deal has been met with fierce opposition from other parties and there have been calls for a second referendum, including Plaid. Asked if it was the right policy direction for the party, Ms Wood said: \"I don't think you can sit on the fence.\" She said she still had concerns \"about the democratic implications of another vote\" despite telling the party conference as leader two years ago she could back another Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU. Ms Wood told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: \"I don't think that we should just embark upon these questions lightly because people will rightly ask what is the point of voting again in any future referendum or indeed election. \"So, there is a real concern about democracy but also there's a concern about democracy if we do crash out of the European Union and it's not just a concern for democracy, it's also a concern for the economy, for the future for young people, for a whole raft of economic issues.\" 'Crisis point' She said a focus on the Brexit debate meant \"we just simply can't get other questions on to the agenda\". \"The fact that the homelessness problem is reaching crisis point, the fact that we are feeding needy families he\n\nSummary:","103":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The woman, identified only as W, underwent gender change surgery at a public hospital a few years ago. Hong Kong's marriage registry had refused her request because her birth certificate still classes her as male. \"The right to marry guaranteed by our constitution extends to the right of a post-operative transsexual to marry in the reassigned capacity,\" the majority ruling, co-written by Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma and Permanent Judge Robert Ribeiro, said. \"In present-day multi-cultural Hong Kong where people profess many different religious faiths or none at all... procreation is no longer (if it ever was) regarded as essential to marriage,\" it added. The ruling said that references to \"woman\" and \"female\" in Hong Kong's marriage law should include post-operative male to female transsexuals. Four of the court's five presiding judges supported the ruling, with the fifth voting against it. However, the court said it would not implement the judgement for the next 12 months, to allow the government time to consider amending the law. 'Radical change' Permanent Judge Patrick Chan, who voted against the ruling, said including post-operative transsexuals in the definition of \"man\" and \"woman\" was \"a radical change of the traditional concept of marriage\". \"There is no evidence that the social attitudes in Hong Kong towards the traditional concept of marriage and the marriage institution have fundamentally altered,\" he said, adding that changes should only be made after \"wide public consultation\". W took her case to the Court of Final Appeal after Hong Kong's High Court ruled against her case in 2010.

Xinhua news agency says receptions for high-ranking officers will no longer feature luxury banquets or alcohol. The diktat, passed on 4 December, has also now sparked similar rules for civilian officials in Beijing. The Communist Party's Central Committee, which includes civilian and military personnel, dictated eight ways that officials needed to change their working practices. In line with the diktat, the military has now ruled out welcome banners, red carpets, floral arrangements, and souvenirs. Officials will also no longer be allowed to stay in luxury hotels during inspection tours and vehicles will not be allowed to make excessive use of sirens. \"Military Commission officials are also required to discipline their spouses, children and subordinates and make sure they do not take bribes,\" the Xinhua report said. In a separate report, Xinhua said the Beijing Municipality had become the first local authority to introduce the rules for its civilian staff. Beijing officials on business will now have simple buffets, rather than banquets.

Microsoft said research breakthroughs had reduced the number of errors made by the instant translation system. It said it modelled the system on the way brains work to improve its accuracy. Details about the project were given by Microsoft research boss Rick Rashid in a blogpost following a presentation he gave in Tianjin, China, in late October that had, he said, started to \"generate a bit of attention\". In the final few minutes of that presentation the words of Mr Rashid were almost instantly turned into Chinese by piping the spoken English through Microsoft's translation system. In addition, the machine-generated version of his words maintained some of his spoken style. 'Dramatic change' This translation became possible, he said, thanks to research done in Microsoft labs that built on earlier breakthroughs. That earlier work ditched the pattern matching approach of the first speech translation systems in favour of statistical models that did a better job of capturing the range of human vocal ability. Improvements in computer technology that can crunch data faster had improved this further but error rates were still running at about 20-25%, he said. In 2010, wrote Mr Rashid, Microsoft researchers working with scientists at the University of Toronto improved translation further using deep neural networks that learn to recognise sound in much the same way as brains do. Applying this technology to speech translation cut error rates to about 15%, said Mr Rashid, calling the improvement a \"dramatic change\". As the networks were trained for longer error rates were likely to fall further, he said. The improved speech recognition system was used by Mr Rashid during his presentation. First, the audio of his speech was translated into English text. Next this was converted into Chinese and the words reordered so they made sense.

There have been concerns about Jeremy Corbyn's performance for months and months. But it was his role, or lack of role, in the campaign to keep the UK in the EU, and his sacking of Hilary Benn in the middle of the night, that has given members of the shadow cabinet the final reasons to quit. Several have already gone; as many as half will be gone by the end of the day, I understand. And documents passed to the BBC suggest Jeremy Corbyn's office sought to delay and water down the Labour Remain campaign. Sources suggest that they are evidence of \"deliberate sabotage\". One email from the leader's office suggests that Mr Corbyn's director of strategy and communications, Seumas Milne, was behind Mr Corbyn's reluctance to take a prominent role in Labour's campaign to keep the UK in the EU. One email, discussing one of the leader's speeches, said it was because of the \"hand of Seumas. If he can't kill it, he will water it down so much to hope nobody notices it\". A series of messages dating back to December seen by the BBC shows correspondence between the party leader's office, the Labour Remain campaign and Labour HQ, discussing the European campaign. It shows how a sentence talking about immigration was removed on one occasion and how Mr Milne refused to sign off a letter signed by 200 MPs after it had already been approved. The documents show concern in Labour HQ and the Labour Remain campaign about Mr Corbyn's commitment to the campaign - one email says: \"What is going on here?\" Another email from Labour Remain sources to the leader's office complains \"there is no EU content here - we agreed to have Europe content in it\".

Proposals include \u00a37.7m of savings in children and younger adults' services for 2013-14. The budget plans will go to the full council for final approval next week. Council leader Andrew Lewer said savings needed to be made as government grants to local authorities had been cut. \"The squeeze on public spending to reduce the national debt means tough choices have to be made. We've already saved \u00a370m and will save a further \u00a327m over the coming year,\" he added. \"We will continue to protect frontline services and jobs wherever possible and look at more efficient ways of working to make every penny of taxpayers' money work for their benefit.\" More cuts 'inevitable' The authority said other departments were being given extra funding to meet pressures on services, such as \u00a31.1m to support rising numbers of children in care and \u00a31.8m to combat increased landfill charges. Council tax will also be frozen for a third year.

The trust said it wanted to save \u00a318.7m by March 2012 but it would still be left with a \u00a319.3m deficit at the end of the financial year. The public sector Unison has not yet commented on the savings plans. 'Tough financial climate' Non-clinical posts affected were seven directors and senior managers, 36 staff from corporate services, and 46 middle management and clinical support roles. Clinical posts affected were 26 doctors, which the trust said represented 4% of the medical workforce. Ending the year with a \u00a319.3m deficit was also subject to agreement with strategic health authority NHS London, a trust statement added. The trust also said it was operating in a tough financial climate, with funding cuts and primary care trusts spending less on hospital treatment, but it would try to reduce the number of job losses. Staff redeployment Chief executive Matthew Hopkins said: \"Our workforce accounts for nearly 70% of the money we spend each year and, as such, we must ensure they are working to the best of their ability.\" Commenting on changes to the medical workforce, he said: \"Based on evidence, we employ the equivalent of 26 more medical staff than other trusts of similar size. \"As such, we believe we can work more efficiently, treating more patients more quickly and, as a result, reduce the amount of extra hours our doctors have to work.\" He said the NHS trust was planning to create 200 roles for specialist staff who would be responsible for supporting patients from the moment they were admitted to the minute they were discharged. Under the plans, the trust would try to avoid compulsory redundancies by cutting temporary staffing which cost \u00a340m a year, and redeploying other staff to vacant roles as workers retired or left, he added.

Diane Wake, the trust's chief executive, said they had been open with the families who were given the opportunity to actively engage in the review process. The trust has three hospital sites across the Black Country and maternity services help deliver about 4,600 babies annually. Investigations 'inadequate' The maternity unit's neonatal mortality and stillbirth rates \"compared favourably\" with national figures in 2014-15, the report said. It was also rated as good by the Care Quality Commission at its last inspection. However, in early in 2016, NHS England alerted Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group to concerns about the high number of \"serious incidents\" in maternity services between April 2014 to December 2015. An internal review group was set up along with input from an external consultant to review the 25 cases.

Is this progress? The two sides are racing to come up with a trade deal by 1 March, or the US has said it will increase tariff rates on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. US trade negotiators agreed to visit China for more discussions in mid-February, Chinese state media reported. In December, the two countries agreed to 90 days of negotiations, in an effort to defuse their escalating trade war, which had led to new tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods.

David Gittens said the first bird fledged at 04:42 BST. \"It headed for the safety of a perch on the bell tower of the cathedral and will await the arrival of the parent birds with breakfast,\" he said. The first egg of the brood was laid on the spire platform, 75m (246ft) above the ground, on 18 March, with the fourth arriving six days later. The first chick hatched on 26 April. Mr Gittens said the first of this year's fledglings left the nest on exactly the same day as last year's first chick. \"After a period of exuberance and running round the box flapping its wings like crazy, our chick jumps up on to the ledge and tips off, turns in the air and flies off strongly. \"We anticipate the other birds will not be far behind.\" Four chicks also hatched in the cathedral nest last year, the second brood in the city since 2011 and among the first in 200 years.\n\nSummary:","116":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The order has apologised \"unreservedly\" to those affected by the abuse and for the actions of its former principal. James Carragher is in jail for sex offences against children at the home. If the compensation claim succeeds, the eventual payout could run into millions of pounds. The school, which closed in 1992, provided residential care and education for boys aged 10 to 16 with emotional and behavioural problems. It was run by the De La Salle brothers on behalf of Middlesbrough Diocese. The order said it \"deeply regrets what happened at St William's\". 'Like giving candy to a baby' Nigel Feeley was sent to St William's in 1972, when he was 13 years old. In 2004, James Carragher was found guilty of sexually abusing him at the home. Mr Feeley said Carragher \"had a gold card to sexually abuse children\". \"It was like giving candy to a baby.\" A former worker at the home told Inside Out in an anonymous interview that \"brothers came and visited [the home] quite regularly and they would take children out\". He said: \"it was a perfect opportunity for abuse\". Solicitor David Greenwood, acting for those claiming compensation, said St William's was \"the biggest single home where boys were abused\" that he had seen. BBC Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire discovered that the Catholic Church had several opportunities to investigate the abuse but failure to act meant boys continued to be abused for decades.

It was painted by an unknown Anglo-Netherlands artist around 1580. Popular in Europe as exotic pets, guinea pigs were introduced from South America by Spanish traders. The youngest boy in the painting is holding a small bird, likely to have been a finch. The portrait - simply titled Three Unknown Elizabethan Children - is part of the exhibition at the London gallery which opens on 10 October and runs until 5 January 2014. The exhibition aims to reflect the rise of new social classes in Elizabethan society and will feature other portraits and objects from the era. A miniature 16th Century portrait of Elizabeth I that turned up in a house clearance sale will also be on display. The gallery bought the previously unknown miniature at an auction late last year for \u00a3329,000. The queen is featured dressed in ermine alongside a peacock in the painting by Isaac Oliver titled Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses. Other paintings that will be part of the exhibition include an elephant on a crest, a falcon and an intricate purse made in the shape of a frog. The exhibition will also include more than 100 objects, such as costumes, jewellery and coins.

Tony Robotham, the head of the chamber's retail sub-group, said: \"I think it's a shame... we ought to have an informed debate about it.\" He said there had been a consensus, at a meeting of the sub-group on Wednesday, that the review should continue. \"Collectively, everyone was of the opinion that retailers should be left to make their own decision as to whether to trade on a Sunday,\" he said. Mr Robotham said a survey of retailers' opinions was due to be undertaken during July and the results would be forwarded to Commerce and Employment. Any shop owner wanting to open on a Sunday in Guernsey currently has to apply to the parish for a licence, which is valid for one year and costs \u00a325. There are 13 categories of licence defined under the Sunday Trading Ordinance, 2002, including those for grocery stores, fuel outlets and souvenir shops. Barry Cash, the senior constable of St Peter Port, said the revenue generated \"barely covers the costs of the visits and the letters and licences and everything else\". \"This year we've done about 75 licences and there's quite a lot of work in them,\" he said. Mr Cash said the decision to scrap the review was \"a disappointment\". However, shop owners and managers in St Peter Port told BBC Guernsey they were happy with the status quo. Ashley Baigent, the manager at The Land of Green Ginger clothing shop, said: \"As a business, we're happy trading from Monday to Saturday.\" \"I think Sunday being closed is good for Guernsey - it keeps it quite unique,\" he said. \"For everyone in retail, it's nice to have a guaranteed day off.\" Cruise ships He said his store had never applied for a licence to trade on a Sunday and he did not anticipate doing so unless \"the whole town was open\".

The riverside gardens in Jamaica Road were part of Thames Water's phase one plan for a new shaft. Thames Water said brown field sites were preferred over green field ones. After a nine-month campaign by residents, the council used the Commons Act 2006 to make the eight-acre site a village green. Campaigners said they hoped its new status would help protect it from future developments. 'Layer of security' A spokeswoman for Thames Water said King's Stairs Gardens is still a \"shortlisted\" site for use, but since November when phase one of consultation ended it has no longer been considered a \"preferred\" site. Instead, Chambers Wharf, a brownfield site, is the favoured location. The Thames Tunnel sewer, which requires construction at a number of sites from west London to Abbey Mills Pumping Station, would \"help tackle\" the 39 million tonnes of raw sewage that leak into the River Thames every year, the company said. It is claimed it will protect the River Thames from increasing pollution for at least the next 100 years. Roger Bilder, chairman of the Save King's Stairs Gardens Action Group, said the granting of village green status was a welcome \"recognition of how much the park is used, appreciated and loved by the local community\". He said: \"It's a wonderful open space, one of the very few riverside parks in central London. \"Although nothing can guarantee 100% protection, this adds another robust layer of security against Thames Water or anyone else who may see this park as a potential site for construction works or development.\" The second phase of public consultation for the sewer scheme finished on 10 February.

The farmer died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 8 August 2016. 'Wrong place' The court heard medical evidence that Mr MacFarlane had also suffered a stroke, and had lung disease and pre-existing heart problems which could have contributed to his death. Giving evidence to the inquiry at Livingston Sheriff Court, eyewitness Andrea Taylor, 28, described the tragedy as a \"one-off\" accident. Miss Taylor, whose family run an arable farm close by said she had never seen a cow leap so high either before or since the accident. She said she had seen cows rear up and jump over a fence where the wires could give way under their weight, but never over a high metal structure. \"I wouldn't say it was an accident waiting to happen. It was just one of those 'one-off' things,\" she told the inquiry. \"It was just where he was standing. You could say it was the wrong place at the wrong time. \"They all escaped and they ran right over him.\" Since the accident, she said, the practice of leaning the pen gates against \"four by four foot\" straw bales had been changed and the cattle hurdles were now tied to a tractor for support.

The mother of a nurse who Boris Johnson specifically praised said she was \"exceptionally proud\" of her daughter. Wales' health minister said last week that the coronavirus lockdown would remain for \"several more weeks at the very least\". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned there was \"no likelihood or prospect\" of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. On Sunday, the UK's total number of hospital deaths linked to coronavirus reached 10,612. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns - imported from China - available to NHS staff in some parts of the country has fallen \"critically low\" in recent days. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered \"a whole load of stock\" weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: \"If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. \"This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply.\" Mr Johnson had spent a week at St Thomas' Hospital in London - including three nights in intensive care - where he was being treated for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Across much of the EU, anti-establishment parties have been polling strongly. They have very different agendas but most of them are anti-immigrant, anti-euro, anti-austerity and anti-Brussels and its power. Some of them, like Marine Le Pen's National Front (FN) in France and Geert Wilders's Freedom Party (PVV) in the Netherlands, have been leading in the polls. The two leaders have formed a loose alliance to \"fight the monster called Europe\". If these anti-EU parties get above 30% of the seats they could disrupt the working of the increasingly important European Parliament. Two points worth remembering: these disparate parties will struggle to work together. Some are from the left, some from the far right and some, like the Five Star Movement in Italy, campaign against the political establishment. Also, the stronger they poll the more likely it is that the established parties in the European Parliament will form alliances to push through their own agenda. In the UK, Nigel Farage and the UK Independence Party (UKIP) will be wary of any alliance with parties which might be branded extreme. But expect an epic struggle: European leaders and the Brussels establishment will denounce these newer parties as extremists and xenophobes. They, in turn, will direct their fire on what they see as an out-of-touch elite.

In 1961, there were 976 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of seven. According to the latest census figures released in 2011, that figure has dropped to a dismal 914. Dr Rakh, who started a small hospital in the western Indian city of Pune in 2007, says that whenever a pregnant woman came for her delivery, all her relatives would come with the hope that the baby would be a boy. \"The biggest challenge for a doctor is to tell relatives that a patient has died. For me, it was equally difficult to tell families that they'd had a daughter,\" he says.

It's not just Zermatt, the resort beneath the Matterhorn where the ski slopes are empty, that needs cheering up. The whole country does. It's four long weeks since the ban on public gatherings was announced. Some of the high points of the Swiss year - such as the Geneva Motor Show and the Basel Watch Fair - were cancelled. It's three weeks since the elderly were advised to stay at home, and the rest of us to travel as little as possible, two weeks since the schools were closed, 11 days since bars, cafes, restaurants and all non-food shops were shut and everyone who could was told to work from home. And still the coronavirus cases keep rising. The army has been mobilised to help hard-pressed hospitals. Switzerland is a rich country, but now 150,000 businesses have put workers on reduced hours. The government has announced a 42bn franc (\u00a335bn; $44bn) support package, but has already admitted it won't be enough. The Swiss attribute their wealth to their readiness to work hard and be sensible. Now they are working hard at following the rules, they are being sensible and staying in.

Nasdaq blamed the \"improper use of test data\" by a third party and said the situation had been fixed. And with markets closed for the 4 July holiday, there'll be no impact on trading. But it got us wondering. What can you buy for $123.47? 1) A ticket to an Aqua concert in Singapore Danish pop group Aqua is reuniting for world tour to mark the 20th anniversary of hit single Barbie Girl. But even though they've been out of the spotlight for a long, long time, it's not cheap to go and see them. Our budget wouldn't stretch to the best seats for their Singapore show. But a Category B ticket will cost 168 Singapore dollars (about $123). We know, we know.... 2) A very English cake made of cheese Including cheddar, creamy Lancashire and white stilton with cranberry, this small cheese celebration cake from Marks and Spencer will serve about 70 portions. It comes in at \u00a395 which is pretty much bang on the equivalent of $123.47. A tasty investment. 3) A fancy smartphone in India Smartphone growth is booming in India with something for every price point. Including the $123.47 budget. That works out at almost exactly 7,990 rupees, which will get you a Samsung J3 from local online retailer Flipkart. Perfect for your future share trading. 4) About 34 shares in Zynga (at its correct price) Zynga - the company behind online games like Farmville and Words With Friends - was one of those whose share price changed dramatically in the glitch. Rather than trading for $123.47 each, their current stock price is around $3.60. So you could snap up around 34 shares and hope to make a profit one day. But remember, the price of shares goes up as well as down. Sometimes by more than anyone expects...

An inquest heard Robert Stuart and Darren Hughes died after operations at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. The kidneys they received had been rejected as \"unfit\" by other hospitals. Mr Stuart, 67, of Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, 42, of Bridgend, died after being given kidneys infected with meningitis-causing parasitic worms. Doctors knew the donor had died from meningitis before accepting the organs, Cardiff Coroner's Court heard last week. But no post mortem examination had been carried out on the un-named donor before his organs were offered for transplant. 'Get in perspective' Prof Warrens, president of the British Transplantation Society, said the death of patients on waiting lists could rise if people start turning down organs where there is an unknown cause of death or increased risk. \"This is a worry. If people don't accept an organ or worry about donating the organs of a relative because of this then more will die needlessly - it is as simple as that,\" he said. \"If they don't get it in perspective they may worry or end up turning down an organ.\" He said the deaths of Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes - who died within three weeks of their transplants - was an \"incredibly rare situation\". \"The vast majority of people who have taken an organ like this wouldn't have run a risk whatsoever,\" he added. \"The chances of dying without a transplant are much higher than dying because of a transplant. \"Three people die every day in the UK for want of an organ.\" Medical history An inquest in Cardiff last week heard Mr Hughes and Mr Stuart died last December from meningoencephalitis, a form of meningitis, caused by an incredibly rare parasitic worm in the donated kidneys which had unknowingly caused the death of their donor.

For a very long time, we haven't been happy and we get to be happy again.\" David Challen, 32, is looking forward to spending his first Christmas with his mum, Sally, in nearly a decade. She spent nine years in prison for killing his dad Richard in 2010. Sally was originally found guilty of murder but successfully appealed against her conviction. She was released from jail in April and the charge was later reduced to manslaughter. David says having his mum back in his life has been \"amazing\" and Christmas will be a \"special time\" for the family. \"I can't really put into words what it means - we didn't expect to be in the situation for another 10 years,\" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"That's how long she had left on her sentence. But it's been amazing to reunite as a family. \"It's obviously a struggle to let her be our mum again. It's a different dynamic, but we're happy to have Christmas together.\" Sally suffered years of emotional abuse from her husband. She was a victim of coercive control - which became a criminal offence in England and Wales in 2015. Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim. Sally's story is told in the BBC documentary, The Case of Sally Challen, which David took part in. During the documentary, viewers see him visiting his dad's grave and he appears haunted when he speaks about what happened. At one point he recalls how he cleaned up his dad's blood from the kitchen floor after police had finished their investigation. \"Dealing with the fact that my mother killed my father is difficult,\" he says. \"She's returned to us as a mother but she killed our father. \"It's obviously a tragedy and something we never wished would happen, nor do we feel that it's justified her actions, but we at least understand them. \"My relationship with my mother is complicated, you can't dance around the fact that she is my mother and she's always b\n\nSummary:","137":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He has made about 150 items this year, including cars, noughts and crosses games, skittles and solitaire, working full days and some evenings. \"I've previously done more, but my age is catching up with me,\" he said.

The Prison Reform Trust said the centre had \"forgotten the basic principles of humanity and decency\". HMIP inspectors compiled the report after an unannounced visit to the centre last August. Handcuffed detainees The 84-year-old was taken to hospital in handcuffs and he died while still in restraints, inspectors found. Doctors said the Canadian man was unfit for detention or deportation after diagnosing him with Alzheimer's disease, but he was not released and no referral was made to social services. Medical notes described him as \"frail, 84 years old, has Alzheimer's disease ... demented. Unfit for detention or deportation. Requires social care\". He had been in handcuffs for almost five hours when he died, the report said. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman is preparing to investigate his death and inquest proceedings are being conducted by West London Coroner's Court. Other examples in the report included a stroke victim in a wheelchair, who was handcuffed on a journey to hospital for no obvious reason and a dying man who remained handcuffed while sedated and undergoing an angioplasty procedure in hospital.

From Damascus and Hama to Aleppo and the seaside city of Latakia, through six years of war in which hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives and more than 12 million have been forced from their homes, the Girl Guides have continued. 'Sense of normality' Women first started holding Guide meetings in Syria in the 1950s and they are being granted full membership of the movement's worldwide body this week. The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (Wagggs) praised the Syria groups' \"incredible work\" at giving their more than 1,000 members \"a sense of normality\" and \"a safe space to play and make friends\". \"Everyone thinks that we're all dying. Actually we are having a normal life,\" says Sham, a 22-year-old student who lives in Damascus, the capital. That might seem incongruous - Damascus has been rocked by suicide bombings and air strikes and has seen battles between rebels and the government. But in any war the intensity of conflict depends on where you are. In government-held Damascus, cafes and markets have stayed open against a backdrop of shelling, even as other cities have been destroyed, displaced families have been left destitute, and millions more people have left Syria altogether. Living in a middle-class part of the capital, Sham knows how lucky she is. \"The war has taken its toll on my country, however, I am thankful it hasn't affected me in person,\" she says. \"Instead, it's made me stronger and helped me realise what I want to do in life.

Cambridgeshire County Council has been working with construction company Kier to revise the costs, but said the company had now increased its estimate. The council said it would be looking for a new company to deliver the work. Kier's estimates for its role in constructing the project had risen from \u00a315.8m to \u00a326.2m, a council spokeswoman confirmed. The planned bypass will connect Peterborough and Whittlesey, with a bridge over the Peterborough-Ely railway line. The council said it would solve long delays - sometimes of up to 13 minutes - when slower freight trains use the level crossing. 'Preposterous' cost hike However, in June, the council requested a further \u00a38.7m from the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, which controls the county's budgets for major infrastructure projects, bringing the total estimated cost of the project to \u00a339m. The combined authority described the hike as \"preposterous\" and the council said it would \"consider its options\". On Wednesday, Kier returned with a revised - and increased - final design and price. Council leader Steve Count said: \"I am clear we should not now proceed with Kier as we cannot agree this final revised cost, which has considerably increased. \"It is a shame that we have been forced to wait so long to receive a price that is so clearly out of line with earlier and even revised expectations. \"My view is the quickest way now to get this much-needed crossing and bridge built would be to re-procure the work on the same route.\" The King's Dyke crossing project will be discussed again at a council meeting on 15 August.\n\nSummary:","143":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Badawi was arrested in 2012 for \"insulting Islam through electronic channels\". Saudi authorities sent his case for review amidst global protests, after the first round of lashes in January. For four years Badawi ran the Liberal Saudi Network, which encouraged online debate on religious and political issues. Ms Haidar said she had held high hopes that her husband was about to be released, but he remained less optimistic. When they last spoke three days ago he told her not to expect him home in the near future. She called on the countries and rights groups that had campaigned for her husband's release to mobilise once more. Badawi received his first 50 lashes in January, but subsequent floggings have been postponed. A shaky video taken on a mobile phone showed Badawi being lashed by a member of the security forces. The footage prompted international protests which were repeated every Friday, the scheduled day for the beatings. In March, the kingdom expressed \"surprise and dismay\" at international criticism over the punishment. At the time, the foreign ministry issued a statement saying it rejected interference in its internal affairs. It is not clear why Badawi has not yet endured a second round though a medical report found he was not fit for the punishment.

If deployed with force, the airbags have the potential to eject deadly shrapnel at passengers. The NHTSA has identified 10 manufacturers who used Takata as a supplier, including General Motors, Honda, and Toyota. The agency has told those who might own affected vehicles to check the list at www.safercar.gov, and specifically warned those living in more humid climates such as Florida and Hawaii to get their vehicles inspected. \"Responding to these recalls, whether old or new, is essential to personal safety and it will help aid our ongoing investigation into Takata airbags and what appears to be a problem related to extended exposure to consistently high humidity and temperatures,\" said NHTSA deputy administrator David Friedman in a statement. Ongoing problem Initially, the NHTSA said that only 4.7 million cars could be affected, but it has increased the number of vehicles twice in recent days. Japanese supplier Takata warned recently that older airbags could explode with too much force, which would send plastic and metal parts towards passengers with enough force to injure them. Takata said it estimated that around 12 million vehicles around the globe may contain the parts. The recall notices have been ongoing for the past 18 months, but regulators and car manufacturers have warned that only a small percentage of those cars potentially affected have been returned and inspected.

France's EDF and CGN, a Chinese nuclear consortium, will build the plant, and possibly two more. Where will the power stations be built? The first will be built at Hinkley Point on the Somerset coast, and is expected to open by 2025 at a cost of about \u00a325bn including financing. EDF says the cost in today's money will be \u00a318bn. China will cover about a third of the cost. EDF said it might sell another 15% stake in the project, but would maintain a majority holding. This will be the third power station at the site. Hinkley Point A was shut down in 2000, while Hinkley Point B is still in use. The government insists that 25,000 jobs will be created by the new power station - Hinkley Point C - and enough energy to power six million homes. Two other stations, at Sizewell in Suffolk, and Bradwell in Essex, are due to follow. The plant at Bradwell is due to be Chinese-designed, which will provide China with its first Western showcase for its nuclear technology. Is it good news? The UK government has been criticised for guaranteeing the price that will be paid for any electricity the new Hinkley Point reactor produces. That could mean, critics such as Greenpeace say, higher energy bills for consumers. Security concerns have also been raised about allowing China a central role in Britain's nuclear future. Is it good value? Not everyone thinks so. The Solar Trade Association thinks solar power could provide the same amount of electricity for half the subsidy cost. Policy chief Mike Landy said: \"The government needs to explain why it is drastically cutting support for solar energy whilst offering double the subsidy to Hinkley Point C. \"It also needs to explain why it is championing overseas state-backed utilities over British solar companies which given stable support would have considerable growth prospects.\" What is this subsidy and why is it needed?

Police said some of the crowd tried to prevent firefighters from extinguishing the blaze, which destroyed the roof. The premier of Saxony, Stanislaw Tillich, described them as \"criminals\". Police suspect arson. The investigation includes detectives who normally deal with extremist crimes. No-one was hurt. 'Unashamed delight' Only a few days ago, protesters in another Saxon town, Clausnitz, blocked the arrival of a bus taking migrants to accommodation. They shouted, \"We are the people\", the slogan of the 1989 peaceful uprising which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. The director of the Clausnitz migrant shelter is a member of the anti-immigrant Alternativ fuer Deutschland (AfD) party. Police in Bautzen said many in the crowd watched the fire and commented with \"unashamed delight\". Two drunken men were arrested after they refused to leave the scene. The converted hotel was supposed to house 300 migrants. In a further sign of anti-migrant sentiment, police in the Brandenburg region are investigating the distribution of leaflets urging \"absolute resistance\" against \"foreigner invasion\". The leaflets, put through letterboxes in the town of Nauen, are the suspected work of neo-Nazis. They also give instructions on making firebombs and using explosives. On Saturday, police defended their response to events in Clausnitz after two videos surfaced online. The first video showed 100 hostile demonstrators preventing a bus from off-loading migrants into their accommodation on Thursday. A second appeared to show police roughly manhandling a boy from the bus into the building. The regional police chief said there were too few police to keep the protesters away, and three of those inside the bus had provoked the crowd.

Greece risks default and moving closer to a possible exit from the eurozone. Greeks have been queuing to withdraw money from cash machines over the weekend, and the Bank of Greece said it was making \"huge efforts\" to keep the machines stocked. Greek banks are expected to stay shut until 7 July, two days after Greece's planned referendum on the terms it had been offered by international creditors for receiving fresh bailout money. The Athens stock exchange will also be closed on Monday. Greece's capital controls Capital controls - how do they work? Eurozone finance ministers blamed Greece for breaking off the talks, and the European Commission took the unusual step on Sunday of publishing proposals by European creditors that it said were on the table at the time. But Greece described creditors' terms as \"not viable\", and asked for an extension of its current deal until after the vote was completed. \"[Rejection] of the Greek government's request for a short extension of the programme was an unprecedented act by European standards, questioning the right of a sovereign people to decide,\" Mr Tsipras on Sunday said in a televised address. \"This decision led the ECB today to limit the liquidity available to Greek banks and forced the Greek central bank to suggest a bank holiday and restrictions on bank withdrawals.\" The Greek prime minister said that wages and pensions, as well as bank deposits, were guaranteed.

Since then, a research project has unpicked their biological secret. The species has been named the Tapanuli orangutan - a third species in addition to the Bornean and Sumatran. It is the first new great ape to be described for almost a century. Publishing their work in the journal Current Biology, the team - including researchers from the University of Zurich, Liverpool John Moores University and the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme - pointed out that there are only 800 individuals remaining, making this one of the world's most threatened ape species. Early on in their study, researchers took DNA from the orangutans, which showed them to be \"peculiar\" compared to other orangutans in Sumatra. So the scientists embarked on a painstaking investigation - reconstructing the animals' evolutionary history through their genetic code. One of the lead researchers, Prof Michael Kr\u00fctzen from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, explained to BBC News: \"The genomic analysis really allows us to look in detail at the history. \"We can probe deep back in time and ask, 'when did these populations split off?'.\" The analysis of a total 37 complete orangutan genomes - the code for the biological make-up of each animal - has now shown that these apes separated from their Bornean relatives less than 700,000 years ago - a snip in evolutionary time. Head to head For his part in the study, Prof Serge Wich, from Liverpool John Moores University, focused on the orangutans' signature calls - loud sounds the male apes make to announce their presence. \"Those calls can carry a kilometre through the forest,\" Prof Wich explained. \"If you look at these calls, you can tease them apart, and we found some subtle differences between these and other populations.\" The final piece of the puzzle, though, was very subtle but consistent diffe\n\nSummary:","156":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The researchers, from Cambridge and Toronto, said they were cautiously optimistic their findings could one day to lead to improved treatments. The study is published in the journal Cell. Motor neurone disease (MND), also known as ALS, is a progressive and terminal disease that damages the function of nerves and muscles, resulting in severe damage to the brain and spinal cord. It affects up to 5,000 adults in the UK at any one time. Frontotemporal dementia is a form of dementia that causes changes in personality and behaviour, and language difficulties. Both conditions are caused by the death of brain cells and this study shows that a similar mechanism is involved in each. 'Jelly with fruit' The researchers looked at a protein called FUS which is vital for nerve cells to work properly. It is able to change state between oily droplets and more solid jellies and in both diseases it can become trapped in its jellied form. Synapses - the point where two nerve cells meet - are highly active and need to produce a lot of new proteins in order for messages to be passed from one cell to the next. FUS grabs the instructions for those proteins as it becomes a jelly and releases them as it becomes an oil. Prof Peter St George-Hyslop, from the University of Cambridge, told the BBC: \"In the jelly phase it is like a fruit salad - jelly with bits of fruit - that move around the cell and the bits of fruit are the machinery needed to make proteins.\" But if FUS stays jellied then that machinery is not released and the brain cell fails to function and eventually dies. In motor neurone disease, the FUS protein can be mutated and more prone to becoming stuck in a jellied form. In frontotemporal dementia, the problem is with other enzymes which help FUS change state, and they tip the balance towards the jelly. Prof St George-Hyslop says these enzymes could be the key to treating bo\n\nSummary:","157":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Toronto police issued an appeal after she went missing on Sunday and later confirmed that her body had been found. Police said there were \"not believed to be any suspicious circumstances\". In 2016, Ms Baloch was named in the BBC's annual list of 100 inspirational and influential women for her work as a campaigner. She left Pakistan in 2015, after terrorism charges were levelled against her. She continued to campaign in exile for the rights of people in Balochistan, both on social media and in person. And the threats followed her, according to Lateef Johar Baloch, a close friend and fellow activist who also lives in Toronto. He told the BBC that Ms Baloch had recently received anonymous threats warning someone would send her a \"Christmas gift\" and \"teach her a lesson\". Ms Baloch's sister told the BBC Urdu service on Tuesday that her death was \"not only a tragedy for the family, but also for the Baloch national movement\". \"She didn't go abroad because she wanted to, but because... open activism in Pakistan had become impossible,\" Mahganj Baloch said. Balochistan province has been host to a long-running separatist insurgency. Ms Baloch was a well-known activist in the region; she was the first female head of the Baloch Students' Organisation (BSO) - a banned activist group. Her first public exposure as an activist was in 2005, in Balochistan's Turbat area, where she attended a protest over missing persons carrying the picture of one of her missing relatives. Activists in Balochistan say thousands of campaigners have gone missing in recent years.

And then his testimony to Congress in February offered further clues. Here are five potential lines of inquiry Mr Mueller could be pursuing and why. Trump tower meeting It's been more than 16 months since the first public disclosure of the 9 June, 2016, Trump Tower meeting between a Russian team lead by lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner - three of the top members of the Trump campaign. The meeting has continued to loom in the background as either a smoking gun of collusion in plain view or campaign business as usual, depending on who's doing the talking. Although Mr Mueller reportedly learned about the meeting at the same time as the rest of America, it's now clearly a point of interest in the special counsel's larger investigation into possible co-operation or co-ordination between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. According to multiple media outlets, the special counsel's office asked the president about whether he had advance knowledge of the meeting in written questions that Mr Trump answered last week. The president supposedly denied - as he has in public - any prior knowledge of the Trump tower get-together, which was presented to his son as both part of an effort by the Russian government to help the Trump campaign and an opportunity to gain \"incriminating information\" about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. If the Trump Tower meeting is evidence of the Trump campaign team's interest in gaining information from Russia, the big question becomes what - if anything - happened next.

This rule applies from the largest commercial poultry unit through to a small flock of hens in someone's back garden. On the last day of February that will change and the government is introducing \"High Risk Areas\" (HRAs) for bird flu. Inside these areas the rules will remain in force and birds must stay inside. Outside the HRA owners can chose to let their birds out if they take certain precautions. High Risk Areas This is a section from the government's map and you can see a typical HRA marked in red close to Telford. Since bird flu is usually spread by migrating waterfowl an HRA is based around a body of water that could attract these birds. And so the government has created HRA's all over England. Big red, round, regular splodges. But as you can also see west of Shrewsbury there's a very odd looking HRA. It's the usual circle but with a big chunk taken out of it. That chunk is due to the border between England and Wales which actually follows the River Severn at that point. Ironically it's the River Severn and its ability to attract wild waterfowl, potentially infected with avian flu, that's the reason for the HRA on the English side in the first place. But the rules are very different in Wales. Meeting in Melverly I travelled to the Shropshire village of Melverly where farmers with chicken, geese or turkeys find themselves in an odd position. On the bridge over the River Severn I met Andy Cawthray who breeds chickens on the English side of the border. He can have up to 600 birds but because of the risk of avian flu he's currently keeping his flock at much lower numbers. It was Andy that noticed the problem with this particular HRA. Andy explained to me that bird flu is a disease that's no respecter of country borders.

Officials have called it a \"variant under investigation\" rather than \"of concern\". The PM had already scaled down his trip due to India's rising number of cases. The country has reported more than 150,000 Covid cases a day for the past three weeks. Speaking about the prime minister's visit to India, a No 10 spokesman said the trip was already \"slightly shorter than it will have been\". Mr Johnson was due to spend four days in the south Asian country but after talks with Narendra Modi's administration, the \"bulk\" of meetings will take place on one day - Monday, 26 April. \"As you would expect, safety is obviously important and is a priority for us on this trip, which is why we will make sure that all elements of the visit are Covid-secure,\" the spokesman said. Public Health England has designated the B.1.617 variant as a \"variant under investigation\" and said there was currently no evidence to suggest it caused more severe disease or that vaccines were less likely to work against it.

Now, 28 companies in Luliang county in Yunnan province have reported industrial output that was more than double what their actual production was last year. According to Xinhua, the companies defended themselves and said that local officials had induced them to do so in exchange for loans from state-owned banks. The trouble with Chinese data is that government officials have been set targets in the successive Five-Year Plans that govern the country's economic planning. And no official would want to miss their target. So, it probably creates an upward bias in their reporting and overstates Chinese growth. Growing discrepancy This is one of the reasons why the National Bureau of Statistics gathers their own statistics from firms and households directly to compute economic growth, so as to not rely on local governments. The gap between the national figure and the combined local figures was 2.7 trillion yuan ($440bn; \u00a3280bn) in 2009 and rose to 5.8 trillion yuan in 2012. That would have added 11% to China's total gross domestic product (GDP) last year. In the first half of this year, the output of all of the provinces was 3.2 trillion yuan higher than the national figure. Computing aggregate Chinese GDP based on provincial data would have put annual GDP expansion at well over 10% in the past three decades. It's not to say that they can overcome all of the biases of course. But, by directly measuring what firms produce and households earn, they also try and address another source of mis-measurement common in developing countries. There may be income that isn't measured if a farmer sells some produce by the side of the road, or urban peddlers selling goods on the street. The so-called grey economy can be fairly large as seen in countries around the world, adding more than 50% to GDP in places like the Middle East and Africa.

The proposal to incorporate Swansea University's bay campus and the online shopping firm's warehouse within the city's boundary came about following a review of Swansea's electoral wards. Officers have given their thoughts on the St Thomas ward, which covers the SA1 development, Port Tennant and St Thomas. In a report going before council, they said the boundary with the neighbouring authority was not clear and \"can easily be clarified by some simple tweaks in the area of Crymlyn Burrows and the Swansea University Bay Campus\". It said a new line should run from the roundabout east of the Amazon depot. A Swansea University spokeswoman was not aware of the proposal but said the entire bay campus is in Neath Port Talbot. However, she added the expanding phase two will cross into Swansea.

His heavily pregnant wife burst into tears in the public gallery after the verdict. Mr Palombo, 40, was the eighth banker to have been convicted on Euribor rate rigging charges in Britain in a series of prosecutions brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Co-defendant Sisse Bohart, a 41-year-old Dane who also once worked at Barclays, was acquitted at Southwark Crown Court. The jury has yet to reach a decision on a third defendant, former Barclays banker Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old Briton. Euribor is a key euro benchmark borrowing rate, underpinning about $150 trillion (\u00a3113 trillion) of financial products, and the accuracy of the rate is important to maintaining trust in the financial system. The defendants were charged with dishonestly manipulating the rate for their own benefit between 2005 and 2009. The SFO sought a retrial of the three former Barclays traders after the jury failed to reach a verdict in July 2018. At the time, two former Euribor traders were given jail time. Former Deutsche Bank employee Christian Bittar was sentenced to five years and four months. Philippe Moryoussef, a former Barclays trader, was sentenced to eight years but he remains in France after fleeing the UK last summer. He was tried in absentia. Brussels-based Euribor, like its Libor counterpart, reflects the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major lenders report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average. Prosecutors alleged that the bankers manipulated Euribor by nudging them up or down to benefit trading positions, deliberately ignoring rules that they should be set independently.

If boards do overspend he said he would expect detailed explanations. He will want to know why they missed cost-cutting targets and would seek a \"compelling set of reasons\" from them. His predecessor, Lesley Griffiths, had indicated she would be willing to sack managers if they did not succeed in balancing their books at the end of the financial year. But Mr Drakeford, who was appointed in a surprise reshuffle this month, said he would not be thinking about \"kneejerk reactions\". Mr Drakeford has been appointed at a time of major change and financial pressure on the NHS, as local health boards are putting forward plans to reorganise hospital services. However, he did warn health boards that there could be consequences. He said \"I don't start from the view that getting rid of people and boards and so on should be the immediate reaction to what might happen - because I think you have to look at those explanations. \"But I want to be clear with health boards in Wales - that if I were to be convinced that the reasons why they haven't succeeded is that they have failed to take the actions that they could have taken and that other health boards have taken - then I do expect people to live up to those responsibilities.\" 'Adequate safeguards' Mr Drakeford also confirmed that the Welsh government was looking to introduce changes to the way the NHS is funded so that budgets can be set over a three-year period, instead of on a yearly basis as is currently the case. But he said he wanted safeguards to make sure that the health service did not use the new regime to rack up big deficits over three years. \"I can see a persuasive case to allow the health service to budget over a three-year cycle.

Club chairman Sue Cook said: \"It's devastating for the club. We worked very hard to fundraise for the pavilion for five years - the whole village pulled together.

Peering into the screen through his funky red and blue 3D glasses, ancient Egypt enthusiast Keith Payne is gripped by the centuries-old story unfolding before his eyes as if through a time-travel lens. \"This is amazing!\" he says. \"I think that being able to use a 3D simulation tool to explore Khufu's pyramid is really a whole new way of both learning and teaching. \"Being able to pause the narration and virtually take control of the camera to go anywhere in the scene and explore for yourself, and then return to the documentary where you left off is a way of learning that was never really available before now.\" This interactive journey, first presented to the public in a 3D theatre in Paris, has now migrated onto the home desktop. To watch the film, users simply download a plug-in and don a pair of 3D glasses - although the software gives the sensation of depth without them too, to a lesser extent. And it works with 3D TVs, too. Controversial theory With help of cutting-edge 3D technology, the video lets users take a peek inside the 146m-high Great Pyramid, the last of the seven wonders of the ancient world still standing. The scene appears as it might have 45 centuries ago - full of the loyal people of the second ruler of the fourth dynasty. But the film is not pure entertainment - besides the educational aspect, it tries to explain one of the theories behind the pyramid's construction. Lying north of modern-day Cairo, the largest and oldest of the three pyramids of the royal necropolis of Giza is believed to have been built as Khufu's tomb.

The inspectors' report said head teachers had been \"marginalised or forced out of their jobs\", and there was evidence of an \"organised campaign to target certain schools\".

Speaking to the BBC after the meeting Glynn Brown, whose son Aaron was allegedly assaulted by hospital staff, said he told Mr Smith that there must be a public inquiry into what has happened. Mr Brown described it as \"a very positive meeting\" and said the secretary of state had listened to what he had to say. \"By the end of the meeting he was better armed with information after what we had told him,\" he told BBC News NI. \"I think he was shocked and I was pleased that he made time to see us,\" he added.

A survey of other sites recently planted with ash from known infected nurseries is continuing. Earlier this month the disease was discovered in Carmarthenshire. Chalara dieback of ash is caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea. The Welsh government said it is taking the threat very seriously. It said officials were working with partners in the Forestry Commission (FC), Defra, The Food and Environment Research Agency (FERA) and the devolved administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland on a UK-wide response to the threat chalara poses. \"Tree diseases do not respect country boundaries and we need to provide a consistent approach to this threat,\" said environment minister John Griffiths. As part of that response FC Wales attended a tree health summit in London to help develop an action plan to manage the disease in the UK. Key objectives for that plan include reducing the rate of spread of the disease, developing resistance in the native UK ash tree population and encouraging the public, landowners and woodland industry to get involved in tackling the problem. The UK government is also working on a longer term solution. There is already a ban on imports and movements of ash plants and seeds into and within Great Britain. \"I believe the action we have taken to date is the proportionate response at this stage,\" added Mr Griffiths. \"This is a rapidly developing situation however and I intend to keep the position under review in order to respond quickly to any new information that might require us to adopt a different approach.\"\n\nSummary:","179":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The arrangement was used until the 1990s, when the EU had fewer members. A Foreign Office source said officials were checking if it was \"possible to return to the system\". People coming to the UK from the European Economic Area - the EU member states and Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - do not have unrestricted access to social security benefits and tax credits. Most have to pass the habitual residence test before they can claim. To do so, they must have a \"right to reside\" in the UK, which means you are economically active, or are able to support yourself, and you must be intending to settle for the time being - to be \"habitually resident\". 'Clear message' Those who pass the test can claim housing benefit, council tax benefit, access to local authority housing, income support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance. Re-introducing a system of national refunds for benefits claims \"might not raise huge sums,\" the senior Foreign Office source said, \"but it would send a clear message about who is picking up the bill for these people\". It is understood Whitehall officials acknowledge that reverting to an approach previously used two decades ago may no longer be practical given EU expansion and changes to European law since then, but it is regarded as worth exploring.

Abdelaziz El Yechioui Ourzat, 30, followed the pair to the address before attacking her, Winchester Crown Court heard. Ourzat, who previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter, will be sentenced on 17 March. At the time of the killing, Ourzat was on bail with the condition he did not contact Ms Ortiz-Lozano after being arrested for causing criminal damage to her home. On the night of the murder, Ourzat monitored Ms Ortiz-Lozano for half an hour as she met her date at a pub in London Road, prosecutors said. The pair left the venue when they spotted him watching them, the court was told. He was then caught on CCTV following them as they walked one mile to Ms Ortiz-Lozano's home. Ourzat entered the property and attacked her, sustaining injuries himself for which he was treated in hospital, police said. He subsequently pleaded guilty to manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility but was found guilty of murder after a two-week trial.

The former UK environment minister and member for Newbury said Australia was ignoring climate change at its peril. The comments come as Australia expands its fossil fuel industry and weakens support for renewable energy. Mr Benyon said Mr Abbott's recent decision to cut Australia's renewable energy target was \"bewildering\" for a country with almost unlimited renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. \"Meanwhile, the giant new coal mining and coal exporting operations on which Mr Abbott appears to be betting Australia's financial health look increasingly risky investments, with bank after bank refusing to back them and demand from China, the world's biggest coal-burning nation, falling,\" wrote Mr Benyon. 'Distorted vision' \"Most of all, Abbott's dismissal of climate science and his belief that Australia must choose between economic growth and tackling climate change speak to a distorted vision of what it means to be a conservative,\" he said. Since winning government in 2013, Mr Abbott has scrapped a number of initiatives introduced by previous governments to address rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Last year, during a visit to Canada, Mr Abbott said climate change was \"not the only or even the most important problem that the world faces\". Australia is still largely powered by coal and is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal. On a per capita basis, Australians are among the world's heaviest emitters of carbon.

He also confirmed that Labour would not back a vote next week on keeping the UK in the single market through membership of the European Economic Area. The UK is due to leave the EU in March next year, after the 2016 referendum. The background to Labour's position Much of the focus at the moment is on what sort of relations the UK will have with the European Union after Brexit. The Conservative government has said that the UK will leave the EU single market and the EU customs union and will no longer be subject to the European Court of Justice, but wants to agree a deal providing as \"frictionless\" trade as possible. The EU says that to have the benefits of the single market the UK must be subject to its rules and also agree to the free movement of people - the latter is something which both main UK parties have currently ruled out. The government's EU Withdrawal Bill (which puts all EU law into UK law to prevent chaos on Brexit day) has been amended by the House of Lords to back a customs union being agreed with the EU, and also for the UK to join the European Economic Area, which would mean it being a member of the single market, like Norway. MPs are due to vote on these and a series of other Lords amendments which are also at odds with the government's position.

The argument centres around the man's hairstyle. Specifically, his dreadlocks. \"You're saying I can't have a hairstyle because of your culture - why?\" the man says. \"Because it's my culture,\" the woman answers back. At one point she pushes him and tries to stop him from walking away. The video, which has been watched more than three million times on YouTube, kicked off a debate online. The man was later identified as Cory Goldstein, a student at San Francisco State University, where the video was apparently filmed. During the argument, Goldstein at one point declares: \"You have no right to tell me what I can wear.\" Most of those commenting seemed to agree - many were critical of the woman. \"Props to the white dude for keeping it civil,\" read one typical comment. Follow BBC Trending on Facebook Join the conversation on this and other stories here. But beyond the specific incident in the video, what of the charge of \"cultural appropriation\" - the use of another ethnic group's fashion, art, or in this case, hairstyle? In a later video response, Goldstein made a distinction between \"appreciation\" and \"appropriation\". \"When people wear Native American headdresses, that's cultural appropriation,\" he said, because only people with \"high standing\" in the Native American community have traditionally been given the right to wear them. (It's this thinking which led the Glastonbury Festival to ban the sale of headdresses, which were once somewhat fashionable). \"The fact I have dreadlocks doesn't mean I'm trying to appropriate culture, it means I love and respect their culture and it's something I hold true to myself,\" Goldstein said. \"These things should bring us closer together.\" The woman in the video has apparently shut down her social media accounts and did not respond to requests for comments.

There have been concerns that private schools may be better at identifying children who might benefit. An independent sector spokesman said children may be \"more likely to be noticed\" at such schools. Stringent tests Ofqual said the new information gathering was not in response to any specific concern about the assistance - known as \"access arrangements\" - that pupils were receiving. It says the move is part of a wider attempt to help exam boards better understand how access arrangements are implemented and to improve \"risk analysis\". Last year more than 107,000 students received up to 25% extra time in their GCSE and A-level exams. The figure is thought to represent around 7% of all examination candidates for the last academic year. In 2012 Ofqual raised concerns about the growing number of candidates receiving the help and more stringent tests were introduced to assess students' need for it, leading to an overall reduction in the figure. A state school source with close working knowledge of the exams system said in his experience a \"large number\" of local independent school students had received extra help compared with their state school counterparts. \"The proportion of students with access arrangements will be less in a state institution,\" he said. \"Kids [in the private sector are] coming from homes where parents are well resourced... pushing the institution to get access arrangements - there isn't an even playing field.\" 'Perverse incentives' A comprehensive school head teacher who did not want to be identified said: \"[Access] arrangements were always intended for a small number of young people with special needs. \"But the accountability system - examinations, performances tables, bums on seats - as ever can create perverse incentives.\" The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), the body that represents examination boa\n\nSummary:","192":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Over the April-to-June period it said it attracted 188 million daily active users (DAU), which is three million fewer than over the previous quarter. There has been plenty of chatter in the past about whether the app's appeal could prove as ephemeral as its content. Reality TV star and entrepreneur Kylie Jenner sent shockwaves in Snap's direction when she suggested she had quit the platform - only to return to it shortly after. The model Chrissy Teigen also attracted attention a month later when she quit on a more permanent basis, citing problems with Snapchat's redesign. But until now, the app's popularity still seemed to be in the ascendancy. \"I think it's really dangerous,\" commented Rob Kniaz, co-founder of the technology venture capital firm Hoxton Ventures. \"When you look at the numbers, if you've lost three million of your most active users by definition, it tells you something is materially wrong with the product and maybe the company.\" Snap's shares fell more than 8% after the New York markets opened. They closed the day 6.8% down. Does Snapchat think this is just a blip? During a conference call, chief executive Evan Spiegel declared he was \"excited\" and \"optimistic\" about the future. But despite acknowledging the daily-active metric was one he focused on, he declined to say whether user numbers were bouncing back in the current period. In fact, his new chief financial officer seemed to hint otherwise. \"While we are not going to give DAU guidance, as a reminder, historically, Q3 DAU growth rates have trended down,\" Tim Stone said.

Keenan was initially isolated for two months before being moved to a shared cell with journalist, John McCarthy. Although anxious to avoid becoming an authority on anything, Keenan's insight into loneliness and aloneness is inevitably more profound than most. \"There's a marked difference between aloneness and loneliness. I quite enjoy solitude but loneliness is different. We all need somebody to talk to, explain things to. If we don't have that we don't have validation and life lacks meaning. Aloneness and liberation \"Having said that I think everybody has a place inside themselves that you alone can go to. You know how to get there because you've got a key. When you go there it can be deeply enriching- it can also be a bit disturbing because it forces you to look at yourself. That's what aloneness is to me. \"It's about taking the time to look at what you are and make good what you are. Sometimes you need to put a sticking plaster on here and there. Aloneness, when you can deal with it, is about liberation.\" It is this inner church where Brian Keenan goes for spiritual reflection. The more conventional methods of worship held no attraction for him before his kidnapping and they hold no attraction now. \"I can't find anything nourishing in churches great or small.

The House of Lords will debate a motion to suspend Lord Lester on Thursday. The 82-year-old peer described the allegations as \"completely untrue\". But the Lords Standards Commissioner upheld the complaint - which is judged on the balance of probabilities - \"on the basis of the strong and cogent evidence of the complainant and her witnesses\". Lord Lester is currently suspended by the Liberal Democrats. 'Abuse of power' In its report, the committee said a complaint had been received in November 2017 that Lord Lester \"had sexually harassed the complainant, had offered her a corrupt inducement to have sexual relations with her, and had warned her of unspecified consequences if she did not accept his offer\". It added: \"These allegations were connected to Lord Lester's conduct of his parliamentary duties.\" The report also said Lord Lester had admitted telling another peer the name of the complainant and that she had been responsible for him being suspended by his party. This was a breach of confidentiality rules, it said. A separate report by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct, which looks at appropriate sanctions, recommended he should be expelled from the House of Lords, saying the \"allegations taken together constituted a grave abuse of power\". After an appeal by Lord Lester, the committee agreed with the commissioner's verdict but changed the sub-committee's recommended sanction from expulsion to suspension.

Four days later, a chest scan showed his clear lungs turning white, a sign of infection. As the fever persisted, he was admitted to hospital - eight days after his first symptoms. At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, doctors put Mr Bagla, 58, through blood tests and administered steroids. As he had an underlying condition - diabetes - his blood sugar soared. Luckily, his oxygen levels never fell perilously low. Before he left the hospital after eight days, doctors showed him a scan of the lungs of an unvaccinated, diabetic, male Covid-19 patient of his age, and compared it to his scan. \"The difference was clear. The doctors told me that if I had not taken the vaccine I would have probably landed up on the ventilator in critical care. Timely and full vaccination saved my life,\" Mr Bagla says. Although India has fully vaccinated a paltry 3% of its 1.3 billion people, breakthrough cases - people contracting the infections two weeks after being fully vaccinated - appear to be rising. Health workers - doctors, nurses, hospital and clinic workers - have borne the brunt of such infections so far. Mr Bagla appeared to be an exception to the rule, so scientists took swabs from his nose and throat to crack the genetic code of the virus which infected him.

But vaccines are not 100% perfect, and they have to work particularly hard during a fast-growing epidemic. So \"vaccine breakthrough infections\" are not unexpected.

Flexible working and the importance of \"high emotional intelligence\" are also being stressed in recruitment. The agencies were responding to calls from MPs to recruit more women. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee reported in March 2015 that 37% of intelligence agency staff were women and women only make up 19% of senior civil servants in the agencies. 'Diversity champions' One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - \"agree wholeheartedly\" with the need for \"diversity\" in agency staff. It says action has been taken since the report was published to \"increase their focus\" on \"all aspects of diversity\", including recruiting more women. Recruitment targets, \"diversity champions\", events such as a recent \"Women in Cyber\" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion. Flexible working They also say they are doing more to \"promote a flexible working culture\" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles. The three agencies also said they were always looking for \"new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach\".

The council said it was advising residents. Mr Cane, 66, said the home he has lived in for 15 years was once 82ft (25m) from the edge of the cliff. But he says the recent cliff falls, which followed weeks of heavy rain, were \"eating away\" at his garden. Mr Cane said: \"I have already been told by the council representative that if [the cliff] gets much closer to my house they will put a demolition order on it and I will be expected to pay to have my house demolished. \"If that's not rubbing salt in the wound, I don't know what is.\" Swale Borough Council and the Environment Agency had agreed on a policy of \"no active intervention\" on coastal defences.

The commission said the construction of the Belo Monte dam should be suspended until the concerns of indigenous people in the area were addressed. There are fears the dam would displace some 20,000 people and damage wildlife. Controversial project On Tuesday, Brazil's foreign ministry described the request by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) - an organ of the Organization of American States - as unjustified and premature. It said Brazil had acted in an \"effective and diligent\" manner to respond to demands by environmentalists and indigenous communities living in the northern Para state, where the the $17bn (\u00a310bn) dam would be built. The ministry added that the federal authorities had carried out all the necessary impact reports on the area. Last Friday, the IACHR said Brazil should stop the dam's licensing process until its developers consulted with environmentalists and indigenous groups in the area. The commission was acting in response to a complaint filed last year by the indigenous communities. The government, in Brasilia, says the dam is crucial for development and will create jobs, as well as provide electricity to 23 million homes. The 11,000-megawatt dam would be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay. It has long been a source of controversy, with bidding halted three times before the state-owned Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco was awarded the contract last year. The singer Sting and film director James Cameron have joined environmentalists in their campaign against the project. They say the 6km (3.7 miles) dam will threaten the survival of a number of indigenous groups and could make some 50,000 people homeless, as 500 sq km (190 sq miles) of land would be flooded.\n\nSummary:","202":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

These findings leave unresolved question of how likely children are to spread the virus to others. They emphasise the continuing role of social distancing and good hygiene as children go back to school. The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Prof Russell Viner explains there are three separate, but linked questions about children and Covid-19: While we know for sure that children can catch the virus, Prof Viner says data from antibody blood tests suggest they may be less susceptible to catching it than adults - particularly children under the age of 12. And scientists are very confident that children are less likely to become ill than adults even if they do catch it, with many not showing any symptoms at all. That's what a British study, published on Friday, confirms. The third question is the one we know least about, and it's this the South Korean study claims to address. What does the South Korean study say? The study, based on 91 children, found that even among those with few or no symptoms, virus could be found in their swabs as much as three weeks later. The fact they had detectable virus in their noses, the authors concluded, suggested they were capable of passing it on. Because of the way South Korea tested, traced and isolated cases, even those without symptoms, it is uniquely placed to look at this group. Once they had identified and isolated cases, the patients were repeatedly tested until the virus had cleared. The study was therefore able to give us some new information about children as carriers of the virus, and their potential capacity to be spreading it onwards. Like other studies, though, it still leaves a missing piece of the puzzle. Just because virus is found in a child's nose does not definitively prove they are transmitting it at the same rate as adults.

The TUC said the measures should include medium-sized businesses and come with fines for non-compliance. The Chartered Management Institute said the new legislation would \"force transparency\" on companies. The plan on bonuses is the first of a number of \"equality-boosting measures\" to be set out in detail this week and hopefully introduced in the first half of 2016, according to Downing Street. Other steps include: Details of exactly what companies must publish and when the scheme will begin will be announced after the results of a consultation, which concluded in September, are released. 'Concentrate minds' More than 10 million workers will be covered by the new transparency rules - although far fewer than that receive bonuses. The measures are contained in the Equality Act 2010, which was introduced by Labour but blocked from implementation by the Conservatives until now. Latest figures show that, overall, women in the UK earn 19% less than men. Up to the age of 40, there is very little difference between the earnings of men and women. But beyond that age, when more women are likely to have taken time out to raise families and work part-time, there is a significant gap.

Aaron Joseph, 30, was convicted of owning a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death. Leeds Crown Court heard the dog called Alex was returned by police just a week before the attack because it was not classed as a dangerous breed. More on this and other stories from across Yorkshire Prosecutor Richard Walters said Mr Ellam had raised concerns Alex might be a banned pit bull terrier two months before his death. Police seized the dog but returned it to Joseph, who lived in the flat above Mr Ellam on Riddings Road, on 8 August. A dog warden visited Joseph five days before the attack and gave him 21 days to comply with the conditions of a dog control order granted in 2012. 'Long custodial sentence' On 15 August, Alex escaped from its kennel and attacked Mr Ellam as he left his flat with his own dog, Rolo. It is thought Mr Ellam was protecting his terrier, which needed emergency veterinary treatment, when the larger dog turned on him. The case was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission - now the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) - and an investigation is ongoing. Mr Ellam's family previously said he volunteered at Huddersfield Town FC and also worked as a lollipop man. Joseph is due to be sentenced on Tuesday and has been warned he is facing \"a long custodial sentence\".

Set in London's East End, the latest series is set in 1960, as the area undergoes some big changes. Redgrave will also continue as the off-camera narrator. Screenwriter and executive producer Heidi Thomas used a trilogy of accounts by the late midwife and writer Jennifer Worth for the first two series. Thomas received Worth's blessing to continue into series three and beyond, even though the memoirs had run out of material by the end of series two. Lark Rise to Candleford actress Linda Bassett and Fresh Meat's Charlotte Ritchie are also joining the cast for the fourth series as Nurse Phyllis Crane and Nurse Barbara Gilbert respectively. \"We're delighted to be welcoming Vanessa Redgrave on screen, having hugely enjoyed her narration of the series to date,\" said Pippa Harris, executive producer of Neal Street Productions, which makes the series. Actress Jessica Raine - who played the young Jennifer Worth - left at the end of series three. The show has been a huge success for BBC One since launching in 2012, winning two Bafta Craft awards and the TV and Radio Industries Club drama programme of the year.\n\nSummary:","211":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

That means all passengers travelling to Scotland from outside the Common Travel Area must self-isolate for 10 days. They must also have a valid negative Covid test result, taken no more than three days before the scheduled time of departure. Similar restrictions are being brought in across the UK. Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"International travel has played a key role in previous waves of coronavirus and is a significant risk to our efforts to suppress the virus to the lowest possible level. \"The emergence of these new variants mean we must think carefully about restrictions on travel. \"It is crucial we take the right steps to prevent importing new strains that can increase transmission or undermine the vaccine in Scotland.\" Travelling to or from Scotland without a reasonable excuse is already against the law. While some exceptions remain where people are travelling for essential reasons, that list of exemptions will be tightened. The Common Travel Area covers the UK, Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Scotland's National Clinical Director, Prof Jason Leitch, told the BBC's Drivetime programme, said it had been a four-country decision to suspend the exemptions to the quarantine rule. \"We are now suspending those travel corridors partly because of our nervousness about variants around the world,\" he said. \"To be clear just now we are exporting the virus to other places, we are not importing the virus. We have a very high prevalence across the UK and other countries are closing their borders to us. \"But importation is still a risk and it's a big risk if we get our numbers down.\" 'Wholly supportive' He acknowledged that it would be \"very difficult\" for people who are overseas or were planning to go abroad.

I will send you a sample straightaway,\" he told an exporter as glum farmers in white pointed caps followed him. He rang off, took a picture of an onion and sent it to the caller using a popular phone app. \"Technology has made things easier for the trade,\" Mr Jain says with a grin. \"After all we have no time to waste here.\" Lasalgaon is Asia's biggest onion market - in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of India's 16 million tonnes annual production. Mr Jain is one of 200 licensed traders in the area who buy onions from some 1,700 farmers. They bring their crop from near and far in tractor trailers to the auction, one of the 13 that take place in the area, five to six days a week. Remarkable vegetable The onion is a remarkable vegetable. It is an essential part of the diets of millions of Indians, rich and poor. Few Indian kitchens can do without the pungent bulb. It's pureed, saut\u00e9ed and garnished in meals, eaten raw as a salad, used as a dip, fried as fritters and crisps. \"The demand for onions is completely inelastic. You cannot substitute it with any other vegetable,\" says farm economist Ashok Gulati, who also heads India's Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. So, Indians cannot do without onions. A glut in supply can bring down prices, hitting tens of thousands of farmers. Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka, the three main growing states that account for 60% of the crop and three-quarters of the trade, are particularly sensitive to price movements. Conversely, a shortage can send prices spiralling and trigger angry protests and even bring down governments. In 2010, the Congress-led ruling government was forced to ban exports and start importing onions to prevent street protests against rising prices. As the New York Times put it \"when the cost of onions goes up, governments can come down\".

Savills and Deloitte Real Estate have been jointly instructed to sell 30 St Mary Axe, which is the building's formal title. The skyscraper was placed in receivership in April. The estate agents have begun marketing the building, with adverts placed in the specialist press, and a website for investors to register an interest, Stephen Down from Savills told the BBC. \"We've started the ball rolling,\" he said. Interest is expected from Chinese, Hong Kong, Singaporean and North American investors, among others, he said. \"I suspect there will be an iconic element to this [sale],\" Mr Down added. After a vetting process on both sides, either one party will be selected, or a number of sealed bids will be accepted, by the end of September or the beginning of October, he said. \"We could see offers in excess of \u00a3650m,\" he added. Insolvency The tower was placed in receivership in April by its creditors after one of its owners was placed in insolvency. Germany's IVG Immobilien, which co-owned the building with private equity firm Evans Randall, filed for insolvency last year. Although Evans Randall said it was willing to buy a bigger stake in the tower, it was unable to agree a new ownership plan with IVG.

Imagine, just for a moment, today is 4 July and the pub is re-opening with certain restrictions. If you've booked a table, great, you can go to your seats. If not, you can only enter if there's a table free. At the entrance, there's a hand-sanitising station you need to use. Once inside, you'll hear soft piped music. The low volume is just enough to give a sense of ambience, says owner Suzanne Millar, but not so loud that anybody has to raise their voices. Raised voices mean more water droplets emanating from people's mouths and that increases the risk of infection transfer. Your table will be bare. Cutlery, napkins and menus will only be laid once you've taken your seats. And the staff member serving you will be a strange sight. Decked out in a plastic face shield, you might spot the personal hand sanitiser dangling from their waist clip. All food and drinks must be ordered from the table. Only staff are allowed at the bar because it is 75cm deep, too shallow to ensure social distancing can be safely observed. Getting to this point has been a \"rollercoaster\" for Mrs Millar and her husband (and head chef) Jim. They only got the keys to the establishment on 16 December before opening on 18 January. Two months later, they were forced to close. \"It was such a crushing moment, I just sat down and cried,\" said Mrs Millar. \"It has been a nerve-wracking time.\" What about the rest of the UK? Each nation is setting its own rules for the reopening of food and drink outlets: With a background in NHS occupational health, Mrs Millar hopes she has planned for every eventuality with her re-opening plans.

But it urged the chancellor to \"resist the temptation to engage in any significant net giveaway\" as a result. It also said that spending cuts could be \"formidably hard to deliver\". The warning comes in the IFS' Green Budget which aims to assess the government's position ahead of the March Budget. Surprise news that the UK economy contracted at the end of last year prompted a debate about whether the government should change its plans to cut spending and raise taxes - which is known as fiscal tightening. The IFS report suggests the government should stay the course and continue with the \"fiscal repair job\" that it aims to complete by the next general election. \"While last week's growth figures were disappointing, this year's Green Budget highlights that any fiscal loosening aimed at helping the economy could be ineffective,\" it said. It said to do so would risk fuelling inflation. This could trigger higher interest rates, which in turn could stymie economic growth. A change also \"risks undermining investor confidence that the remainder of the fiscal consolidation plan, in which the chancellor has set such store, will be delivered\", the report added. Responding to the IFS report, a government source said the Green Budget was an endorsement of its policy. However Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This report exposes the myth that George Osborne had no choice but to cut the deficit at this speed and scale. \"We have been clear that George Osborne has made a political choice to cut too far, too fast and that without a plan for jobs and growth you can't get the deficit down.\" 'Gloomy caveats' The BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, concluded that the IFS report was broadly supportive of the government's plans - but with \"gloomy caveats\". \"They [the IFS] think the downside risks are probably\n\nSummary:","216":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council said the sublease for the house of multiple occupation (HMO) had been revoked before the decision. Planning officer Tom Hubbard said he extended his sympathy to occupants. The former hotel has been used as accommodation for homeless people since 1988. In January, Pierfront Properties applied to convert it into 14 flats and to replace a coach house with five houses, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Two previous applications to demolish the hotel building were refused. The majority of objections to the plans were from people living in the building, including Edward Hyde who told BCP it would exacerbate the homeless situation and put the welfare of residents at risk. He said: \"I am pleading with yourselves to refuse the planning of our homes to give us continuing support for people who are the most vulnerable in our society.\" Another occupant, Christopher Whitely, told the council he and others in the building had been issued eviction notices for 27 September, and added: \"All residents are in complete limbo for their futures.\" You may also be interested in: Karen Hunt, who oversaw the homeless accommodation, had urged Pierfront to withdraw the plans, saying the lives of people living there had been transformed.

He said the airport would announce next Friday if a replacement had been found. \"We've had to go back to airlines in the last 24 hours and re-engage on the basis that the BMI Baby routes are going to terminate on 11 June,\" he said. \"It's a big ask to get another airline lined up for 12 June, and we'll make an announcement in a week's time on whether we'll be able to backfill immediately or if there will be a gap.\" The budget airline was taken over last month by IAG, parent company of British Airways. IAG said it had to act in the face of big losses, and promised to provide full refunds. Consumer Council chief executive Antoinette McKeown said on Friday that IAG had \"very serious questions to answer\". \"Why did British Airways not give passengers sufficient warning that they were withdrawing BMI Baby from Northern Ireland? When did they take this decision? \"Why are British Airways withdrawing BMI Baby from Belfast in advance of the busy holiday season when other bases around the UK are to stay open until the autumn? \"Why will it take up to 21 days to refund the cost of flights?

The scandal has already cost VW \u20ac30bn (\u00a326.6bn) worldwide. While the company settled in the US, where emissions rules are stricter, it is resisting settling with its domestic customers. This is the first time Germans could pursue group claims since the law was changed last year. This trial will settle points of law and the claimants will later be able to file follow-up claims for compensation if they are successful. The trial, at Braunschweig Higher Regional Court, about 20 miles from VW's Wolfsburg head office, is likely to last years, however. While settling was unlikely to be a quick solution, the court would support such an effort, judge Michael Neef said. Part of VW's settlements so far include a deal to buy back 500,000 cars in the US, where it has agreed to pay more than $25bn (\u00a320bn). In Australia the company will pay 127 million Australian dollars (\u00a370m) to compensate owners, paying them A$1,400 apiece. Last week it emerged that three current and former Volkswagen executives were charged with market manipulation in connection with the diesel emissions scandal. Chief executive Herbert Diess, chairman Hans Dieter P\u00f6tsch and ex-boss Martin Winterkorn, did not inform investors early enough about the financial fallout, German prosecutors allege. In 2015, the firm admitted using illegal software to cheat on emissions tests. VW said it was confident those allegations would prove groundless. This may be a landmark lawsuit - and in terms of the sheer number of claimants, it's certainly attention grabbing. But it may not be the biggest concern for Volkswagen right now. Unless there is a settlement, the legal process is likely to take take years - VW expects it to take at least four.

He moved to the city from Jamaica aged 10, became a TV regular in the 1990s as Mr Motivator and has this year appeared on the BBC's HealthCheck UK Live. Evans is one of many black celebrities to speak about George Floyd's death. The unarmed African American's killing by a white police officer who knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis last month has spurred global protests led by the Black Lives Matter movement. \"It hurt me watching that, it's taken me a while to get up and speak about it,\" Evans said. The TV star said his first memory of overt racism was at a job interview at a knitwear firm in Leicester, aged 16. He said: \"I'd spoken to the guy on the phone, I walked in and he asked me 'Why didn't you tell me you were black?'. \"And I said to him 'Because you didn't tell me you were white'.\" Evans moved to the UK in 1962 to be with his adoptive father, who had emigrated from Jamaica four years earlier. He spent the next 11 years living in Leicester. \"The government policy during the Windrush years was if you came from a particular island, they would almost recommend that you went and stayed in a particular area,\" he said. \"So, for example, in Leicester there were lots of people from Jamaica.\" Leicester, like it is today, was \"a melting pot\" of cultures, he said, and he went to school with children from India and Pakistan as well as the West Indies. But it was when he moved to London in 1973 that Evans became more aware of overt racism. \"I was walking with a white girl under my arm, and people would look at me.

Drugs are suspected of playing a part in 250 fatal accidents a year in the UK. Now the government has said it wants to introduce a similar system in the UK as soon as possible. Newsbeat's been to Dunkirk in France to see how it works. As well as pulling over cars and breathalysing for alcohol, police in the French port have extra powers. During one stop, a man in his early 20s passes the breathalyser test - but police are still suspicious. \"The visage - his face, the face,\" says the police officer. \"We suppose that he has been smoking cannabis.\" What happens next cannot - as things stand - happen in the UK. They take him to a nearby van to check for drug use and to get a swab of saliva. Ten minutes later the results come back negative. But more than 9,000 motorists have been convicted of drug driving in France since this type of testing was introduced in 2003. A similar system exists in countries like Germany, Italy and Australia. Testing in the UK In Britain, police don't test for drugs at the roadside. They check for things like dilated pupils and - if drug use is suspected - the person is asked to walk in a straight line and count to 30. If they fail then can they be taken away to give a blood sample. But campaigners say that doesn't happen often enough. \"They haven't taken it seriously enough,\" says Michaela Groves. \"It actually gives you the same effects as drink driving does.

He said he almost aborted the dive because his helmet visor fogged up. It took just under 10 minutes for him to descend. Only the last few thousand feet were negotiated by parachute. Once down, he fell to his knees and raised his fists in triumph. Helicopter recovery teams were on hand moments later. \"Let me tell you - when I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble. You don't think about breaking records anymore, you don't think about gaining scientific data - the only thing that you want is to come back alive,\" he said afterwards at a media conference. None of the new marks set by Baumgartner can be classed as \"official\" until endorsed by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI). Its representative was the first to greet the skydiver on the ground. GPS data recorded on to a microcard in the Austrian's chest pack will form the basis for the height and speed claims that are made. These will be submitted formally through the Aerosport Club of Austria for certification. There was concern early in the dive that Baumgartner was in trouble. He was supposed to get himself into a delta position - head down, arms swept back - as soon as possible after leaving his capsule. But the video showed him tumbling over and over. Eventually, however, he was able to use his great experience, from more than 2,500 career dives, to correct his fall and get into a stable configuration.

Leaving Beijing to go and live in Lagos is not a well-worn path. But both Nigeria and China are the most populous countries and biggest economies in their respective continents, making them ripe for comparison. I feel I've left behind the grey, imposing order of Beijing for the chaos and colour of Lagos, where fun and frustration are doled out in equal measure. Part of the correspondent's condition is that your ears prick up at the slightest mention of a previous posting. Imagine my surprise then when, watching last month's inauguration of the new Nigerian cabinet, a remark about the Great Wall of China cropped up during the opening address. The point, I believe, that the official was trying to make was that the Great Wall was not in itself enough to protect China from invaders - the government and people need to be incorruptible as well. I say believe because the audio on the state broadcast briefly cut out. In China, an audio glitch at such an important event would cause heads to roll in shame. In Nigeria, people roll their eyes and shrug it off. It is just one small example of how the Chinese are known for getting things done, while in Nigeria there is a reputation for cutting corners. Whereas Beijing is a city of smog (the killer downside to the country's breakneck development), Lagos is a city of generators (the sound of a nation failing to realise its economic potential because it can't get its power grid in order).

The figures run counter to data released recently that has indicated the economy picking up. As a result, the pound dropped sharply against the dollar, falling by nearly 1% to $1.4814. That is the lowest level since June 2010. Growth hopes The latest manufacturing numbers contrast with a survey of the sector published last week, which indicated it recorded its best growth for nearly two years in June. Other surveys published last week pointed to continuing strength in the services sector, and a rise in confidence across UK businesses. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has estimated that the strong growth being seen in the services sector means the UK economy as a whole grew by 0.6% in the second quarter of the year. That compares with 0.3% growth in the first three months of the year. NIESR says that while the recession may technically have ended, the period of depression, which it defines as a period when output is depressed below its previous peak, will continue for some time. The institute does not expect output to pass the peak recorded in early 2008 until 2015.

Allegations in 1964 about the pair's relationship caused such concern within Downing Street that the then head of MI5 was summoned to the Home Office. The government feared a scandal greater than the so-called Profumo Affair.

Declassified files 'Drunken' spies defections shook US confidence Frogman files reveal \"Buster\" Crabb blunders The Sunday Mirror - which did not name the pair - claimed to have a photo of Kray and Boothby together with the bisexual peer's chauffeur and lover, Leslie Holt. The men were later identified in a German magazine. Lord Boothby publicly denied having a homosexual or any other close relationship with Kray. At the time, he said the photograph showed them discussing \"business matters\", dismissing rumours about his personal life as a \"tissue of atrocious lies\". The Sunday Mirror ended up paying \u00a340,000 in damages to Boothby. But the papers - released as part of 400 declassified files by the Security Service (MI5), Foreign Office and Cabinet Office - reveal new information about their association.

Brooke feared the allegations might erupt into a scandal to rival the Profumo affair, which helped to bring down the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan. Sir Roger told the home secretary how MI5 had received reports that Lord Boothby was bisexual and had contacts with the Krays. But, since he had no access to official secrets, MI5 concluded that Boothby's private life was of no concern, the papers reveal. According to an MI5 source, Lord Boothby was in a relationship with Holt - his chauffer and\n\nSummary:","227":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But according to the daughters of a teacher who brought the lawsuit, the words were used without permission. Ellen Newlin Chase and Margaret Chase Perry had said the show should have bought the rights to the lyrics. Their mother Ellen, a nursery school teacher from New Hampshire who died in 2004, was said to have written \"soft kitty\" as a poem in the 1930s. The legal case, brought against network CBS, said The Big Bang Theory had used the lyrics on at least eight episodes, since March 2008. CBS was sued for copyright violation in 2015 but a New York district judge has now dismissed the case. In the show, Sheldon Cooper (played by Jim Parsons) describes how his mother used to sing him the two-line song - ending with \"happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr\" - when he was ill. The song has been been featured on Big Bang Theory merchandise, from T-shirts to fridge magnets. According to the dropped lawsuit against Big Bang Theory, Warner Bros. Entertainment and the show's other producers sought permission in 2007 to use the lyrics from Willis Music Co - a Kentucky-based company that had published them in a book called Songs for the Nursery School. But, according to the claim, Willis Music gave permission to use the lyrics without consulting Mrs Newlin's heirs even though the book makes clear that Mrs Newlin was the author and owned the copyright to the lyrics.

It took more than a month for the university to process a self-referral and a further month for her to see a counsellor, a court was told. The philosophy student, from Bradford, died a month later. Ms Thacker had suffered mental health problems since she was 13 and had a history of depression and self-harm, Gerard Majella Courthouse was told. The day after taking an overdose and being treated in hospital, she filled out a self-referral form for the university's mental health support team revealing she was struggling to cope, the inquest heard.

It was a further month before she had a face-to-face conversation with the first year student, the court was told. Ms Pendleton admitted she did not consider Ms Thacker to be at immediate risk despite confessing she had taken an overdose.

The scheme was originally due to run weekly but will run once a month due to operating costs of \u00a3195,000. Baldwin Street, King Street and all roads in the Old City will be closed during car-free Sundays. Mr Ferguson said five days were planned this summer, with the first on 23 June. The \u00a3195,000 cost covers all five days. 'Suck it and see' He said he had been inspired by similar schemes in Bordeaux in France and Bogota in Colombia. \"I'm very keen on taking a 'suck it and see' approach and this is why we're starting on a monthly basis - if it's a success we'll move it into a weekly basis,\" Mr Ferguson said. \"I want people to feel their way and see how they to respond to it. \"It will have some costs in the early stages while we set it up, but in time I hope it becomes a natural thing with a very low cost.\" He added the money would pay for marshalling the road closures and also to provide some of the entertainment. Blue badge spaces People will still be able to drive in to the city as there will be routes to the main car parks, Mr Ferguson said.

But it is not unprecedented. On several occasions in the last 30 years, the Palace has taken legal action against newspapers or action to prevent personal information being published. Only once has a case actually come to trial. On every other occasion the Palace has accepted an out-of-court settlement. The case that came to court involved Princess Margaret's son, Viscount Linley - coincidentally the owner of the French chateau at which William and Kate were staying when they were photographed this summer. In 1990, he sued the now-defunct newspaper Today for libel after it accused him of rowdy behaviour in a pub: He won \u00a330,000 damages. The Queen has twice sued the Sun for breach of copyright. The first time was in 1988, when relations between the royals and the tabloids were particularly bad. The paper reached an out-of-court settlement after publishing a stolen photograph showing Sarah, Duchess of York and her daughter, Princess Beatrice, which the royal family had planned to use on their Christmas card that year. The second time was in 1993 - when royal-tabloid relations were just as bad - when the paper paid \u00a3200,000 to charity in an out-of-court settlement after publishing a leaked text of the Queen's Christmas broadcast. That same year Princess Diana started legal action against the Daily Mirror when it published photographs taken with a hidden camera of her exercising in a gym. The paper apologised and reportedly paid Diana's legal costs of \u00a31m plus a further \u00a3200,000 to charity. But the gym owner refused to settle, caving in only in February 1995, a week before the case was due to start. He apologised and gave up the \u00a3300,000 he had made from selling the pictures.

Mr Michael's election was announced at a count in Port Talbot ahead of three other candidates. He was up against a Conservative candidate and two independents. Mr Michael resigned as MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, after a career in Westminster of 25 years, to run in the PCC election. His son Tal was fighting the north Wales PCC seat for Labour but he came second to independent candidate Winston Roddick, a barrister and former senior legal adviser to the assembly. Mr Michael is a former Welsh secretary, ex-Home Office minister and was the Welsh assembly's first leader. He says his priority as commissioner would be to make sure that South Wales Police focuses its resources on making communities safe and free from crime, and ensuring police are accountable to local people. \"The challenge now is to pick up the new role, which has not been defined adequately as yet, and to make sure I add value to the work of the police and the work of crime reduction,\" he told BBC Wales. \"When you speak directly to people, once people have a chance of asking you about what you're about and what the role can be used to achieve, you get very positive results.\" But he criticised the UK government for not explaining or promoting the elections, and for not allowing candidates to send material to electors through the post. \"I hope lessons will be learnt; the public will respect the elections if the government respects the public by allowing the elections to be organised properly,\" he added. Other candidates included former police officer Michael Baker, standing as an independent; Caroline Jones (Conservative) and retired businessman Tony Verderame, another independent.

But party leader Deputy Premier John Barilaro said: \"We are not anti-koala.\" He said his lawmakers would no longer sit with Premier Gladys Berejiklian's Liberal Party in the state parliament. It effectively puts Ms Berejiklian in minority government until the situation is resolved. She said she would strip National Party ministers of their portfolios if they did not change their mind. The dispute - dubbed a \"koala war\" by the Sydney Morning Herald - relates to the government's State Environmental Planning Policy (Sepp), which became law last December. It aims to better protect koala habitats. In June an inquiry found koalas would be extinct in NSW by 2050 without urgent action. Last summer's bushfires killed or harmed three billion animals nationally, according to a recent estimate. But Mr Barilaro argued the protection policy went too far by placing onerous conditions on property owners about how they managed their land. \"We think a Sepp like this is somehow a way to sanitise the regions, attack the property rights of landholders and do absolutely nothing to support koalas,\" he said. He added: \"The National Party stands for a thriving koala population. We actually want to see the population double. We are not anti-koala.\" But Liberal Party politicians said the measures were necessary and supported by the community. Federal Greens leader Adam Bandt tweeted the Nationals were \"blowing up the NSW government because they want rogue landholders to be able to kill more koalas\". Some conservationists have argued the current policy does not do enough to protect the animals. Ms Berejiklian said it was \"not possible\" for a minister to sit on the crossbench. \"If required, I will attend Government House tomorrow and swear in a new ministry,\" she said, giving Mr Barilaro a deadline of 9:00 Friday local time (23:00 GMT Thursday).\n\nSummary:","234":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Earlier this month, the entire leadership of Golden Dawn was convicted of running a criminal organisation. Party leader Nikos Michaloliakos and senior colleagues were given 13 years in jail, after a five-year trial. Golden Dawn had 18 MPs elected amid Greece's crippling financial crisis in 2012, but a criminal inquiry began into the party the following year after the murder of an anti-fascist musician. The sentences were passed on 14 October but Greek law does allow for the start of jail terms to be suspended during the appeals process. However, a court ruled on Thursday that most of the jail sentences should start straight away. Michaloliakos was among 37 people who turned themselves in. Giorgos Roupakias, who was convicted of the 2013 murder of the musician and given a life sentence, was under house arrest and was also handed over. While Pappas evaded arrest, a former member of the party hierarchy, Ioannis Lagos, who was also convicted and faces 13 years in jail, currently has immunity as he was elected as a Europe MP last year. What happened to Pappas? Christos Pappas's lawyer said his client would not surrender as he expected his conviction to be quashed on appeal. The former deputy leader also faces 13 years in jail. Greek reports said police had searched for Pappas at his Athens home and also a property in northern Greece late on Thursday. There was some surprise that police had allowed him to evade arrest as he was among several Golden Dawn figures supposedly being kept under scrutiny. Some reports indicated he had not been seen for several weeks. Citizen Protection Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis came under pressure to resign over Pappas's escape. \"You had one job!\" complained lawyer Thanassis Kampagiannis, who took part in the trial.

Mr Thomas built the additions at his luxury riverside home near the beauty spot of Salcombe without planning permission.

There are conflicting report about whether the blast occurred while people were watching football or a film. Militant Islamist group Boko Haram is being blamed for the attack. There was no immediate comment from the group. Formed in Borno State, the group has waged a brutal insurgency across the north-east for a decade. Ali Hassan, leader of a self-defence group in Konduga, told AFP news agency that the owner of the hall had prevented one bomber from entering. \"There was a heated argument between the operator and the bomber who blew himself up,\" he said. Two other attackers who were nearby then set off their devices. The number of deaths was so high because emergency services arrived late to the site of the blast and were not adequately equipped to deal with such a large number of wounded people, Usman Kachalla, head of operations at the State Emergency Management Agency (Sema) told AFP. Video halls are common across northern Nigeria. They are usually rudimentary buildings where people pay a small fee to watch football matches or films. Boko Haram has targeted them on several occasions, saying they are unIslamic. Konduga has been targeted before. In July 2018, eight people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated explosives in a mosque. At least 27,000 lives have been lost and about two million people forced to flee their homes in the conflict with Boko Haram. 'Daunting and complex security challenges' This latest attack comes at the end of a bloody weekend in northern Nigeria. There is rising concern of insecurity in other parts of the country.

This was as a result of tariffs being imposed by the countries on each other. \"It is not a cost we anticipated, and it's one we hope to take in our stride,\" he told the BBC. The company expects the tariffs to have only a small impact on the current financial year, and says it has various ways to mitigate the impact in the future. The tariffs have previously been imposed on items such as cars, food and footwear, but many people had not realised books would be targeted as well. Separately, Mr Newton said that some of Bloomsbury's illustrated books are printed in China, \"because the quality is so good and the pricing is so good\". 'Second-half weighted' Mr Newton was speaking after the firm said it expected its full-year performance to be in line with expectations. In the six months to the end of August, the publisher reported a 5% drop in sales to \u00a371.3m with pre-tax profits falling by nearly 19% to \u00a31.3m. However, the firm said it was confident about future sales. Mr Newton told the BBC: \"The publishing year is traditionally second-half weighted with back-to-university in October, and the big Christmas gifting season in the second half - so it's very much a game of two halves.\" This month, Bloomsbury has published titles including the illustrated version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In its results statement, the company said: \"With our strong consumer list in the second half, our sales are therefore expected to be even more second-half weighted than in previous years.\" In recent years, there were fears that the publishing industry would be harmed by the introduction of electronic books and other new technology.

The memo is set to be filed through the State Department's \"dissent channel,\" a way for employees to register policy disagreements with the Secretary of State and other top officials. While dissent cables are not that unusual, a State Department official has told the BBC that this document has garnered \"hundreds\" of signatures, which would be \"unprecedented.\" And while the dissent channel is meant to provide an avenue for protest without fear of reprisal, there are strong indications that this administration might not see it that way. Asked about State Department criticism of the immigration ban, the White House Spokesman Sean Spicer said if \"these career bureaucrats\" had a problem with it, \"they should either get with the programme or they can go.\" The draft dissent cable argues Mr Trump's Executive Order will be ineffective because of the \"vanishingly small\" number of terror attacks committed by foreign nationals admitted to the US on a visa. It warns that the ban will increase anti-American sentiment; that it will have an immediate and clear humanitarian impact; and that it will sour relations with the countries on the blacklist - Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and Libya - as well as much of the Muslim world. Going even further in a personal and moral appeal, the draft says the ban \"stands in opposition to the core American and constitutional values that we, as federal employees, took an oath to uphold,\" such as equality and an abhorrence of discrimination on race, religion, sex or national origin. Mr Spicer said the criticism was blown way out of proportion.

Proposals include the \u00a3100m scheme to include an embankment in the north west relief road plans. Hundreds of homes in the county were hit by storms in February. The project, which has secured more than \u00a370m of funding, could see a \"water-retaining\" embankment included in the plans for the relief road. This would reduce the risk for communities along the River Severn, south of Shrewsbury, according to the report. An alternative proposal also being considered would see a dam built further upstream, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The authority's director of place Mark Barrow said both proposals needed detailed work to \"assess their suitability\". The county has received claims for flood-related grants from 438 homes and 418 businesses, the report said. It also revealed that during the floods' peak its customer service centre averaged 23,000 calls a day, instead of its usual volume of about 2,500. And with river levels estimated to rise by 85cm by 2050, the report calls for action. \"In that context and left unaddressed, future flooding events could affect many thousands more properties, businesses and communities not previously affected,\" Mr Barrow said. \"In that sense relying on the measures currently in place and taking an ad-hoc localised approach to river defences is not sustainable.\" The cabinet is due to meet on 7 September.

But the organisers at a licensing meeting on Thursday called the measure disproportionate and said they were willing to increase security there. Licensing sub-committee members said they felt they had \"no other option\". Bo-Eun Jung, barrister for Thames Valley Police, called the event a \"hotspot for crime and gang activity\" and said it was \"only a matter of time before someone is killed at the carnival\". According to the force, a number of violent incidents took place during the event in Prospect Park in May last year including two teenagers being stabbed and reports of large fights. Ms Jung added police \"did not have confidence\" in the carnival's organiser, Reading Caribbean Cultural Group (RCCG), which the force said, was \"out of their depth\". Bill Donne, barrister for RCCG, said \"things have to change\" and organisers were committed to controlling numbers with advance tickets, hiring more security, and fencing off the event in Prospect Park after the procession. He added \"the vast majority of people were perfectly well behaved\" and police had put a \"very forceful case\" forward. The carnival has been running in the town since 1977. The council's principal licensing and enforcement officer Clyde Masson suggested organisers should consider moving out of Prospect Park, and it should be more multicultural and not just about \"one area of the town's history\". Mr Donne responded: \"It isn't exclusive to people of Caribbean ancestry, it is open to all and enjoyed by all.\" Delivering the decision chair of the sub-committee councillor Deborah Edwards said \"there were not sufficient plans or management structure in place to ensure a well-run and safe event\". She added she hoped \"whole-heartedly\" the RCCG would apply for another licence in time for May 2021.

The trial has been agreed after \"extensive preparation\" and assessment of the risk of bare legs being cut on broken glass, one council said. A few UK councils already allow shorts. Refuse loaders from South Cambridgeshire, Cambridge City and Huntingdonshire councils donned their shorts for the first time on Monday and will be allowed to wear the knee-length attire until October. Crew member Gordon Cullum said working in last summer's high temperatures had proved \"very challenging\". \"This has definitely lifted our spirits - it's already feeling a lot cooler for us when we're wearing shorts rather than trousers,\" he said. 'Risk of shorts' Rosy Moore, Cambridge City Council's executive councillor for climate change, environment and city centre, said: \"The Greater Cambridge shared waste service has more than 150 frontline bin collection staff, with each crew emptying up to 1,300 bins during a typical day.\" Each crew member walks the equivalent of about 12 miles (19km) during their shift, a South Cambridgeshire District Council spokesman said. Huntingdonshire has about 80 staff which collect an average of 23,000 bins a day. The trial will be \"carefully monitored\" and the \"risk of wearing shorts while emptying bins has been evaluated as part of this process\". \"Residents can play their part by keeping glass inside their recycling bin only and not in additional clear sacks,\" he said. The spokesman said he was aware of two other councils in the Midlands which currently allow refuse workers to wear shorts, as well as one in Wales and one in Scotland.

In a dengue-affected part of the Cayman Islands, researchers found the GM males mated successfully with wild females. In Nature Biotechnology journal, they say such mating has not before been proven in the wild, and could cut the number of disease-carrying mosquitoes. Dengue is caused by a virus transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito as it bites. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that there may be 50 million cases each year, and the incidence is rising, with some countries reporting what the WHO terms \"explosive\" outbreaks. As yet, there is no vaccine. Radiation damage As far back as the 1940s, it was realised that releasing sterile males into the wild could control insects that carried disease or were agricultural pests. When females breed with the sterile males rather than wild fertile ones, there will be no viable offspring, meaning there are fewer mosquitoes around to transmit the disease. In the 1950s, the screwworm fly was eradicated from the Caribbean island of Curacao using males sterilised by radiation. But the technology has not worked so well with disease-carrying insects. Generally, the sterilising process weakens the males so much that they struggle to mate; the wild males are dominant. Oxitec, a company spun off from Oxford University, uses a genetic engineering approach. Offspring of their GM males live through the larval stage but die as pupae, before reaching adulthood. In the latest study, the research group - which includes scientists from Imperial College London and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine - released batches of GM mosquitoes in 2009 in an area of the Cayman Islands where Aedes aegypti are common, and dengue sometimes present. A proportion of the eggs collected from the study area in subsequent weeks carried the introduced gene, meaning the biotech mosquitoes had mated successfully.

If the merger is cleared by regulators, the new company will be owned equally by current Dow and DuPont shareholders. The companies aim to achieve the split into three within two years of the completion of the merger. They hope to save $3bn through cost-cutting during that period. Potential tax savings were one reason for the complicated merger-before-breakup deal, analysts said. James Sheehan, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst, said: \"They need to merge first in order for the subsequent spin-offs to qualify as tax-free transactions in the United States.\" At the same time, DuPont announced a cost-saving plan that will involve cutting about 10% of staff.

Fund re-tests In May, the Irish government said it would fund re-tests for anyone concerned about previous assessments. Earlier this month, Emma Mhic Mhath\u00fana, a mother-of-five from County Kerry, died at the age of 37. She was one of the most public figures in the 'CervicalCheck' national screening programme crisis. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016 after receiving two incorrect smear test results. The Health Service Executive (HSE) said that between May and September almost 42,500 repeat tests were undertaken. However, the results of more than 86,000 samples have still not been progressed and reported. The normal backlog is around 23,000 tests. Some women are waiting 18 weeks to receive their results. The HSE also confirmed that Colposcopy clinics, which receive notifications of abnormalities, are experiencing an increase in demand. Additional capacity In a statement, the HSE said: \"The HSE regrets that we are currently experiencing significant delays in the reporting of cervical smear test results. \"The programme has operated for many years with a reporting time of between four and six weeks for cervical screening. \"Unfortunately results are currently being reported within 18 weeks of the test being taken.

Clashes between Chinese security personnel and Tibetans reportedly broke out following the self-immolations. More than 40 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in the past year. Five - these two men and three previous protesters - have self-immolated in the last 10 days alone, say campaigners, in what appears to be an escalation of Tibetan protests inside China. An unconfirmed report says one Tibetan was beaten to death. 'Batons spiked with nails' Twenty-year-old Lungtok and 21-year-old Tashi \"set themselves on fire inside a prayer-wheel hut near Kirti Monastery in Ngaba Town\", reported campaign group Free Tibet, using the Tibetan name for the town which China refers to as Aba. \"Once they were in flames, [they] came out of the hut and walked towards the street now known as Martyrs' Street,\" overtly linking their action to the protests of previous self-immolators, it said. Chinese paramilitary police quickly moved in with extinguishers, local sources said, and whisked away the two men. Free Tibet said Lungtok died and Tashi's condition was unknown. Multiple reports suggest that following the self-immolations Tibetans began to demonstrate and their numbers quickly increased. \"Eyewitnesses report that some demonstrators were beaten with metal batons spiked with nails and that some people were dragged away,\" said Free Tibet. Many people were injured and some were detained, it said. A source who spoke to Radio Free Asia (RFA) said one Tibetan was beaten to death, but this report has not been confirmed.

The rethink follows global outcry over the laws, including boycotts and celebrity protests. While still on the statute books for some crimes, no executions have been carried out in Brunei since 1957. Last month Brunei rolled out a strict new interpretation of Islamic laws, or Sharia. In a speech, the sultan said he was aware there had been \"many questions and misperceptions\" regarding the implementation of the legislation, called Syariah Penal Code Order (SPCO). While saying that a moratorium on the death penalty would be applied to the SPCO he also defended the new rules, saying their \"merit\" would become clear. The speech marks the first time the country's ruler has spoken publicly about the legislation since their introduction. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said she was \"delighted the death penalty has been removed and that the de facto moratorium which has been in place for more than two decades, will also cover the SPCO\". Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. What are the laws? The small South-East Asian nation first introduced Sharia law in 2014, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The first phase covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines. The laws introduced on 3 April marked the next phase of the legislation, and covered crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Under the legislation: What was the reaction? The laws sparked international outrage, throwing the tiny South-East Asian nation into the global spotlight.

The Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority said it had accepted the plan to return the bank to a firm footing. \"Supervisors will remain closely engaged with the bank while the actions announced today are taken forward. Implementation is subject to certain regulatory approvals,\" said the PRA, which is responsible for supervising the UK's banks and insurance companies. The debt-for-equity swap with hedge funds means that the Co-op Group's stake in the bank will fall from 20% to about 1%. The Co-op also said that the relationship agreement between the group and the bank, covering the promotion of bank services to members of the wider business and other matters, \"will naturally fall away and come to a formal end in 2020\". It added that it \"is supportive of the plan and intends to vote in favour of the capital raising\".

It has been offered to school-age girls, to protect them from cervical cancer, since 2008. However, there have been repeated calls for the vaccine to be given to all boys as well. In November 2015, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises all UK governments - called for the HPV jab to be offered to gay men up to the age of 45. The JCVI said there would also be a \"substantial benefit\" in reducing the number of genital warts. Health minister Jane Ellison announced: \"Through this pilot, the HPV vaccine will be offered during existing appointments at selected GUM (sexual health) and HIV clinics in England to test delivery in these settings. \"Public Health England is in the process of agreeing which GUM and HIV clinics will take part in the pilot. \"A full roll-out of a HPV vaccination programme for men who have sex with men will be dependent on the progress and outcome of the pilot.\" The jab is also being rolled out in Wales. Dr Shaun Griffin, from the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"The announcement of this pilot feels like a cynical stalling tactic. \"Back in November, the government said that all MSM up to the age of 45 would be able to access the HPV vaccine across the country - now, six months later, we are disappointed to see this has been scaled down to a small-scale and unnecessary pilot.\" Peter Baker, from the charity HPV Action, said: \"The extension of the HPV vaccination programme to protect men has been characterised by delay after delay. \"The best way of protecting men who have sex with men, as well as all other men, is to vaccinate all adolescent boys. \"It is vital that a decision on this issue is made soon because, with every year that passes, almost 400,000 more boys are left unprotected.\" Follow James on Twitter.

He went missing on 11 July and his family fears he will never be found. There are fears he might have collapsed in a remote area or even taken his own life because of health worries. Police have been concentrating their search in and around the market town as the last recorded use of his pass was when he caught the 78 Bristol to Thornbury service on the day he disappeared. Despite extensive publicity no-one has come forward to say they saw him then or on previous dates when records show he stayed for up to four hours before catching a bus back to Bristol. Det Ch Insp Matthew Iddon told BBC West's Inside Out family and friends know of no particular link with Thornbury and said officers really need to understand why he went there. DJ Derek had told a friend the night before he disappeared he had suffered bad head pains but they had gone away and he felt fine. Twin sister Shirley Griffiths fears her brother may have taken his life - if he had thought he had a health problem. She said she was chatting with him at a wedding weeks before and he was joking about getting old. \"He told me 'If I became ill, gaga, not with it I don't want family or authorities to have to care for me',\" she explained. \"My biggest scare... is we might never find him.\" Mr Iddon said a search of his flat found no evidence of foul play.

Deborah Moggach, author of the novel adapted for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel films about retired people from the UK going to India, said: \"Loneliness really is the last taboo.\" She said old age must not be an \"inevitable descent into despair\" and more efforts had to be made to stop people becoming isolated and lonely. \"We have to stop thinking of this as someone else's problem. As a society, we need to recognise loneliness as an issue, and put something in place that enables older generations to flourish - not flounder,\" said Moggach. 'Stigma' of loneliness The research from the LSE has been published alongside the Campaign to End Loneliness, a group set up by charities and local authorities. There are an estimated 1.2 million people in the UK who have \"chronic\" loneliness, with links to poorer physical and mental health and increased use of GPs, hospitals and social services. The campaign says it should be seen as a problem in public health terms, like obesity and smoking. For a decade of an older person's life, the extra economic cost of loneliness is calculated as \u00a36,000. Over five years, preventing loneliness could see a saving of \u00a33.6m, say the researchers. Loneliness is also linked in the study to earlier death and higher risks of dementia.

Mr Wright made the comment on Thursday when questioned by Labour's legal affairs spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds. In 2012, Mr Evans was found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, the previous year. He served half of a five-year prison term. But that conviction was quashed on appeal last April and he was found not guilty of the same charge at the subsequent retrial. Mr Wright said: \"We need to understand more about the decision in this particular case, we need to understand whether a change in the law is appropriate.\" He said, if a change was not appropriate, the government should look at the guidance given to judges about when evidence is admissible and the instructions judges give to jurors about how it should be used. \"I think we need to do all those things before we're in a position to understand what, if any, changes are needed,\" he added. During the retrial, the jury heard evidence from two men who had intimate relationships with the complainant around the time of the alleged offence of which Mr Evans was accused. Both described \"sexual behaviour\" similar to that Mr Evans said he had observed during his encounter with her. The decision to allow the details before the jury was heavily criticised by some, including blogger Jean Hatchet who said it was \"callous and cruel\". It was also criticised by former solicitor general Vera Baird QC. After the conclusion of the trial, BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said defence lawyers are usually barred from cross-examining an alleged victim about their sexual behaviour or history to protect them from \"humiliating treatment\".

Dr Stein had condensed Jung's theories, originally scattered across 18 volumes of his collected works, into an accessible primer for students and trainee psychoanalysts. His course became a book - Jung's Map Of The Soul - which is now recognised as one of the best introductions to the concepts of analytical psychology, reprinted 15 times in English, and translated into dozens of languages. Much to Dr Stein's surprise, it is also the basis of the latest album by South Korean pop phenomena BTS - set to go to number one on both sides of the Atlantic this week. \"A couple of months ago, a Japanese student told me he'd discovered that the BTS website was recommending my book,\" he tells the BBC from International School of Analytical Psychology in Zurich. \"I said, 'What is BTS?' and he told me, so I looked them up online, read a little bit about them and left it at that. \"Then about a month ago, the same student told me they were coming out with a new album titled Map Of The Soul: Persona. \"I was floored.\" It's not just the album title, though: BTS's lyrics delve into Jungian concepts of the psyche, ego and collective unconscious - with a particular focus on the idea of Persona. \"Persona is a reference to the theatre,\" explains Dr Stein. \"It's the Latin word for the masks that actors wore on the stage - and we all put on masks, in a sense, when we go out into public. \"It's part of being a social animal: Our need to get along with other people, our need to be polite, our need to be part of a group. \"In some cultures this is more important than others, and I must say in the Asian cultures of Korea and Japan, where BTS originate, persona is an extremely important part of their lives. \"How you present yourself, how you address other people, how you locate yoursel\n\nSummary:","264":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

One in five is not at the level expected for English at age 11. Rigorous teaching of phonics, which focuses on the sounds of letters and letter combinations, could help all pupils, of any background, she said. Passionate Ms Gilbert said: \"Despite some major initiatives in recent years to raise standards in reading and writing, the levels achieved by many children at the end of primary school fall stubbornly short of what is achievable.\" The literacy levels of England's 11-year-olds are measured by the national tests - or Sats - and are published in the primary school league tables. Last year 80% of pupils achieved the grade for English the government expects them to (Level 4), with girls (85%) outshining boys (75%). Reading levels are higher, with 86% making the grade, while in writing only 68% do so. Pupils are also assessed by their teachers at the age of six or seven in reading, writing, maths and science. The latest data on those Key Stage 1 assessments - published last Thursday - showed that nearly 85% of pupils were reading at the expected level (Level 2), with girls doing better than boys. Overall, there was a slight rise in reading and writing levels on last year's results. Ofsted has published a report which looks at how 12 top-rated schools teach children to read and write and hopes it will be a guide to the best practice in teaching phonics. Ms Gilbert said the schools represented a wide range of communities but shared some key similarities - they all had high expectations of all children and taught pupils to read using phonics. \"They are passionate in their belief that every child can learn to read,\" she said. \"Teaching children to read is at the heart of their curriculum. Rigorous, intensive and systematic phonics teaching underpins reading, spelling and writing.\n\nSummary:","265":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The king granted him a full pardon in May, three years after he was jailed for sodomy. Mr Anwar's former rival and current Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad - who is 93 - has promised to hand over power to him in two years' time. The pair shocked many by joining forces to oust the previous ruling coalition in May's general election. According to the Election Commission, Mr Anwar received 71% of Saturday's votes from Port Dickson, where a member of the current coalition stepped down to allow for his accession. Greeted by supporters at a polling station in the coastal town, Mr Anwar had told an AFP reporter: \"I will see you in parliament on Monday.\" Political drama resolved? Dr Mahathir's election win, at the head of the then-opposition party Pakatan Harapan, ended more than six decades of rule by the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition. Both he and Mr Anwar were formerly in power, as part of the BN, as PM and deputy respectively. Mr Anwar was seen as Dr Mahathir's heir apparent but the relationship soured when Mr Anwar was sacked in 1998 after a leadership dispute, and then jailed on corruption and sodomy charges, widely regarded as politically motivated. In 2004, his sodomy conviction was overturned and he led the opposition to unprecedented gains - though remained short of victory - in the 2008 and 2013 general elections. But that acquittal was itself overturned a year later - as he was preparing to fight a state election he seemed likely to win - and he was sent back to jail to finish his nine-year term. Mr Anwar has since insisted he holds no malice towards his former mentor, who secured his royal pardon.\n\nSummary:","266":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers, was brought in to complete the film, but fans complained he made the film too light-hearted. HBO's announcement comes a week before the release its new streaming service. Warner Media, which produced Justice League, is also the parent company of HBO. Competition among streaming services has heated up over the last year as more companies have entered the field. Announcing content with Hollywood A-listers or with popular franchise like the DC Comics or Star Wars has been one way that services have tried to attract subscribers. \"These brands come with built in fan bases so there will be eyes on the streaming service based on the brand recognition,\" said Vince Peters, chief executive officer of Inheritance AI. A darker Justice League Many fans have been calling for a \"Snyder-cut\" of Justice League since the film was released in 2017. Synder completed most the filming for the movie based on the DC Comic Book. But he stepped away from the project before post-production and editing work following the suicide of his daughter. Whedon, who created the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, did several reshoots and fans suggested he gave the film a lighter tone than Synder's original intent. On social media, the hashtag #ReleasetheSnyderCut has been used by fans calling for a new version of the film. It is not yet known whether the new version, set to be released in 2021 will be a six-part series or a nearly four-hour long directors-cut film.

His victims were made to work 90-hour weeks in squalid conditions in exchange for accommodation, leftover takeaway food and alcohol. Newcastle Crown Court ordered Bariana to repay the proceeds of his crime. Northumbria Police said assets worth \u00a3133,000, including two houses and a large amount of cash, had been seized. The remaining \u00a3142,000 will still have to be paid off, the force said. A spokesman said Bariana's victims, who were all white British men, were made to clean sewage pipes by hand and work 13-hour days in bare feet. The court previously heard they also had to work for free in his takeaway restaurant. Bariana, of Blue House Farm, Netherton, Bedlington, took all their housing benefit as payment. If the victims refused he would then resort to violence and intimidation, the force said. He was found guilty of six offences of requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour relating to four men between 2010 and 2016. Insp Billy Mulligan said: \"Hargit Bariana preyed on vulnerable victims for his own gain and their consistent bravery and strength during this whole process has been inspiring. \"Hopefully his victims can find comfort knowing that Bariana is not only behind bars but has now had these assets taken off him. It should also serve as a warning to anyone who thinks they can take advantage of others for their own selfish gains.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

It also highlights a tense relationship between Kitchener and Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. Churchill had 10 million rounds at his disposal but rejected the request with a reply of \"No, no, no, no...\" The exchange was found by military genealogy website Forces War Records in the National Archives at Kew. Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener was overseeing the British Expeditionary Force being overwhelmed by the German army in Belgium at the time. British and Belgian forces were trying to delay the Germans from breaking into France. But as they were pushed back to Antwerp, Kitchener - famed for featuring on WW1 recruitment posters with the slogan \"Your Country Needs You\" - wrote to the future prime minister on 27 August requesting help. \"My dear Churchill. As we are keeping Antwerp going with ammunition, please give any you can spare from your ships to us,\" he wrote in the letter from the War Office. \"I think you said 10 million rounds would be available. It makes me shudder to think of troops without ammunition.\" \"May I send an officer to the Admiralty to talk to your people about this and take over your contribution to Antwerp?\" Churchill, appointed to his post in Asquith's government in 1911, wrote a reply in red ink on the bottom of the letter for his secretary to write up. \"No, no, no, no. 10,000,000 rounds is all I have got for the fleet. I have already given 500,000 rounds,\" he said. \"I will see if anything can be scraped up from the ships to enable me to dispense with the 2,000,000 rounds we were counting on from you!\" Forces War Records suggests Churchill may have let his dislike for Kitchener influence his sentiments but says the actual letter his secretary sent to Kitchener would been \"more subtle\".

Victims of black-cab rapist John Worboys feel \"betrayed\" by the decision to release him, a solicitor has said. The PM also revealed that she knew one of Worboys' victims. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, she explained that the victim she knew had not been told that he would be released, but had heard about it through the media. \"I fully recognise why people are concerned about this\", she said. \"We want to ensure that victims feel confident enough to come forward, so that they feel confident that the police will take action, and confident that they will get justice.\" In a statement, the justice secretary, David Lidington, acknowledged that Worboys' release \"must have reawakened the most appalling memories\". He said there was a \"strong case\" to review the system in order to make sure that victims had the option to be kept informed about cases. Worboys, who was convicted of 19 offences and is suspected of attacking more than 100 women, has served ten years in jail. When sentenced, he was given an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection (IPP) and told he would not be released until parole officials were convinced he did not pose a threat to women. After a hearing about his case in November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with \"stringent\" licence conditions.\n\nSummary:","270":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A hearing took place in central London to lay out procedures for the inquiry, which begins on 21 May. A fire alert cut short the morning session, but there was no evacuation. An alarm sounded at Holborn Bars in central London at 12:35 GMT saying a fire had been reported and was being investigated, but people were urged to stay where they were. Richard Millet QC, counsel to the inquiry, said it was agreed that survivors and family members should be able to memorialise their loved ones \"calmly and with dignity\" ahead of the oral evidence. \"By starting the public hearings of this inquiry in this way, we can ensure that, however technical and scientific the issues may then become, however dry, however legal, we will never lose sight of who our work is for and why we are doing it,\" he said. The tower block fire in west London killed 71 people last June. Wednesday's hearing also heard that 150 venues were considered before it was decided to hold the inquiry at Holborn Bars. It will be screened at Notting Hill Community Church, close to the Grenfell Tower site, where affected people can watch it together. 'Touched a nerve' Aiasha Mohamed, 16, whose aunt and two cousins died in the fire, told the BBC that representatives at the inquiry should consider speaking in plainer English as she found it difficult for someone her age to follow. She also suggested translators were on hand for those who do not speak English, like her mother, Sayeda. Sayeda, who only speaks Arabic, told the BBC some of the statements were too short and they deserved to hear more. Grenfell Tower resident Nicholas Burton, whose wife died in January, said Wednesday's hearing was like being in the dentist's chair. \"It was when they touched a nerve, you heard the sound go up,\" he told the BBC.

Some of eastern DR Congo's numerous armed groups are based in the park. More than 130 park rangers have been killed in Virunga since 1996. Lawless region Mr De Merode was shot in the stomach and legs with four bullets, Cosma Wilungula, the secretary-general of the Congolese Institute for Conservation and Nature, told the BBC. The park said on its Twitter account that Mr De Merode was \"in a stable but critical condition\". Mr De Merode's work attracted him a lot of enemies, Mr Wilungula said. \"He was protecting the resources of the park and preventing people from accessing those resources,\" Mr Wilungula said. Mr De Merode was driving unescorted from Goma to Rumangabo when gunmen ambushed his vehicle on Tuesday, he added. Goma is about 50km (30 miles) from Rumangabo, the headquarters of Virunga National Park. Several diplomatic sources said Mr De Merode had attended a meeting with a state prosecutor in Goma before he was shot, reports the BBC's Maud Jullien from the capital Kinshasa. He had apparently handed the prosecutor sensitive information about oil exploration at Virunga, she says. UK-based oil firm Soco International is exploring for oil at Virunga, despite strong criticism from environmental organisations, our correspondent adds. The firm condemned the attack on Mr De Merode. \"Soco does not condone violence of any kind and makes it clear that any suggestion linking Soco to this crime is completely unfounded, defamatory and highly inappropriate,\" it said in a statement.

Flight operator LinksAir believes it will be a popular route, both for people travelling on business, and for tourists. The airline, which runs the daily Welsh Government subsidised flights from Anglesey to Cardiff, was looking for another destination to fly onto after Cardiff, because the plane was effectively sitting dormant for much of the day between flights to and from Anglesey. Norwich facts Source: Visit Norwich LinksAir looked for a route which was not already offered by Bristol airport. It hit upon Norwich. From April the 19-seater plane which flies from Anglesey to Cardiff will stop briefly in the Welsh capital to pick up and drop off passengers, before going onto Norwich. Later in the afternoon it will take the same route back to Anglesey. The main clientele LinksAir hopes to tap into, are business people connected with the energy industry. The airline's commercial manager Roger Hage said: \"We needed to do a route that was niche. This route is aimed at business as there are a number of employees who work in gas offshore in East Anglia and the Norfolk coast. Energy is very important to Norfolk, and Anglesey has set out its plans as the energy island.\" It is hoped the flights will be popular with these workers as, after Aberdeen Airport, Norfolk has the biggest heliport in the UK serving the offshore industry in oil, gas and windfarms.

Could 2015 turn out to be the worst ever festive season for retailers? We ask the experts. The pessimist Richard Hyman, veteran retail industry expert: The discounting this year is unprecedented. I've never seen anything like this and I've been working in the industry for 35 years. Retailers across every sector of the industry have spent the last year teaching customers to only buy on sale. UK retail now has too many companies, with too many stores and too many websites, chasing too few customers. An excess of supply over demand is forcing the majority of the industry to resort to price cutting in order to put money in the tills. And the message to shoppers is clear - if you see something you like, wait for the next promotion when it will be cheaper. Right now, 70% of companies are running a price promotion. Clearly, the majority of retailers feel that they cannot entice shoppers to spend without offering the price drug as an incentive. When most of the market is discounting, it tells you that they are doing it by default not by design. It suggests spending is so weak that sales are not coming through in the way retailers need and they have to turn stock into cash. What we're seeing now is a structural change in retail indicating a growing excess of supply over demand. Pre-Christmas sales have become the new normal. The problem is the new normal of having your margins cut and brand integrity damaged is neither healthy nor sustainable. Next year we will see the beginnings of a serious shake out. It will take several years for an effective reset of supply and demand to get to a more viable status quo.

Some cut-off communities have taken to starting their own services, with Wales and north-west England hardest hit. The government has encouraged councils and bus companies to work together to halt the decline. One lobbying group fears the scale of the miles lost are a sign buses are on course to be cut to the same extent railways were in the 1960s. During that decade thousands of miles of track were scrapped and hundreds of stations closed following a report by British Railways Board chairman Dr Richard Beeching. Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"We are not talking a loss of that level, but we are heading that way. \"We live in a society that is quite prepared to completely abandon certain groups of people and leave them with no options of getting around.\" Communities around the UK say the shrinking bus network is leaving people unable to reach basic services such as shops and GP surgeries. In Chard in Somerset, mother Melissa Whittaker told the BBC how a 10-mile journey to take her autistic son Issac to their nearest community hospital can take three hours, the same time it would take to walk.

Under proposals, its A&E will close and the maternity unit be downgraded after neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust ran up debts of \u00a3150m. The government said \"doing nothing is not an option\" and is to make a decision on 1 February. Campaigners are angry Lewisham Hospital, which is not part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, is being targeted in a re-organisation of services across the area following the trusts's financial problems. Under the plans, the trust's Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich would come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation. Lewisham's A&E unit would then be downgraded to an urgent care centre, meaning emergency cases would be seen at nearby hospitals. The maternity unit at Lewisham could also be slimmed down, meaning complex cases would be dealt with elsewhere. South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals, was placed in administration last year when it started losing about \u00a31.3m a week. The problems it faces are not unique. Last year it was reported 20 trusts had declared themselves financially unsustainable in their current form. Matthew Kershaw, a special administrator, said in a report to the government that the trust should be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of services. If implemented fully, Mr Kershaw said his recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London, and help deliver \"safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services.\" Mr Kershaw also recommended the Department of Health (DoH) write off any debts to ensure new organisations were not \"saddled with the issues of the past\". \"I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept,\" his r\n\nSummary:","280":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

So how long should a fridge or a freezer last, and is it worth spending a bit more on a better model? 'Going strong' Ann Barlow is expecting a visit from her grandchildren and begins mixing the ingredients for a cake. They are soon whizzing round effortlessly, if not noiselessly, in the same trusty electric mixer that she has used for 40 years. It is a Kenwood Chef bought locally in the West Midlands. Then - at the time of the miners' strike - it would have cost around a month's wages. But for Ann Barlow, it was her best buy ever. \"I hoped it would last well, but had no idea it would still be going strong for this long. It's never even been in for a service. It is a little bit noisy now, but that doesn't matter\", she says. 'Conking out' Our relentless demand for cheap household appliances is taking its toll on the durability of the products we buy. Blame it on the smartphone. With new technology constantly offering fresh features, many people have got used to the idea of upgrading devices nearly every year. As a result, it seems our expectation of the lifespan of household gadgets is also reducing. Shoppers constantly search online for the best deals and High Street retailers have to compete to make sales. It is this erosion of prices which has inevitably taken its toll on the build quality and longevity of mass-market products. On its website, the Whitegoods Trade Association (WTA) openly acknowledges that the average lifespan has dropped in relation to prices. Take the example of a washing machine. Its life expectancy has dropped by a full three years over the last decade or so, meaning many will conk out pretty quickly. \"Over 40% cost \n\nSummary:","281":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Findings Ofgem found that EDF had breached some aspects of the licences governing the information it gives when selling to customers. Customers were not always given complete information on matters including contract terms and the way their direct debits or annual consumption was calculated.

Mr Guaid\u00f3 has called on President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to resign. The two men have been at loggerheads for more than a month. While Mr Guaid\u00f3 has been recognised by more than 50 countries, Mr Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Cuba, insists he is the only legitimate president. Why is Mr Guaid\u00f3's return risky? After Mr Guaid\u00f3 proclaimed himself interim president on 23 January, Venezuela's Supreme Court - which is dominated by loyalists of President Maduro - placed a travel ban on the opposition leader. Mr Guaid\u00f3 defied that to attend a fund-raising concert in Colombia on 22 February organised by billionaire Richard Branson. Mr Guaid\u00f3 also led efforts to try to bring humanitarian aid, mainly donated by the US, into Venezuela. The government of Mr Maduro rejected the aid, arguing it was part of a US plot to overthrow him. The president ordered the closure of borders with Colombia and Brazil. Soldiers blocked the aid trucks, leading to clashes that left at least five dead. The Maduro government alleged - without giving any evidence - that the aid was contaminated and carcinogenic. How will he get back in? It is not clear. He had left by secretly sneaking across the Venezuela-Colombia border, reportedly with the help of sympathetic Venezuelan soldiers. Mr Guaid\u00f3 could sneak back over the porous 2,200km (1,370 mile) border on one of the many paths used by smugglers. He could also go via Brazil or Guyana, which also share borders, mostly in deep jungle. In all three cases, he would face a long journey to Caracas. The other option, and the most confrontational one, would be to fly directly into Caracas. There are direct commercial flights from Bogot\u00e1 and Panama City. How likely is his arrest?

But Matthew Ellis has decided to rescind the scheme and also begin a recruitment drive for new officers for the first time in over two years. Mr Ellis called it a \"small, important step\". A Staffordshire Police Federation spokesman welcomed the news. The PCC, who only took up his post last month, needs to find savings of \u00a338.7m over the next four years but has already made it clear that he wants more \"visible policing\". 'Immense pressure' He said: \"The operational policing ability of the force is being hampered by a loss of experienced officers because they're being forced to retire after 30 years' service and at the same time there's no new blood coming in which is a real problem.\" He said the police authority brought the measure in, which was due to be reviewed in April next year with the expectation that it would continue until 2014. \"My judgement is that that would put immense pressure at both ends on the police service and the priority has to be visible policing and an excellent police service,\" Mr Ellis said. \"There are officers being talked to who are on the cusp of retiring so they will be given the choice as to whether they want to go through with it or stay longer.\" Mr Ellis added that about 21 staff were currently nearing 30 years' pensionable service and that recruitment for 30 new officers had begun.

An inquiry was launched in April when it emerged Whitehall computers were used to make the disparaging entries. The edits included the phrase \"Blame Liverpool fans\". The 24-year-old junior administrator, who was born in London but lives in Liverpool, has been dismissed for gross misconduct. His sacking follows an investigation by The Daily Telegraph which identified him through his internet activity. The man altered the Wikipedia page for Hillsborough in 2012, including one entry that parodied the Liverpool fans' anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by changing it to \"You'll Never Walk Again\". 'Unacceptable conduct' A Commons statement from Cabinet Officer minister Francis Maude said: \"I was deeply distressed that, at a time when the hearings of the Hillsborough inquests were unfolding, the Civil Service was brought into disrepute by these edits. \"Our position from the very start has been that the amendments made to Wikipedia are sickening. The behaviour is in complete contravention of the Civil Service code and every canon of civilised conduct. It is entirely unacceptable.\" The department had feared the length of time since the amendments, which were made in 2009 and 2012, would make it impossible to identify those responsible. However, Mr Maude said the investigation had not been able to identify the culprit of the 2009 Wikipedia edits, owing to technical obstacles.

The Weinstein Company directors said that \"in light of new information about misconduct\" his employment had been terminated \"effective immediately\". Mr Weinstein had been informed. His sudden departure comes after the New York Times published a report last week about sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades. The 65-year-old apologised and said he planned to take a leave of absence. \"The way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologise for it,\" Mr Weinstein said. However, he later disputed the report, which said he had reached at least eight settlements with women, and vowed to take legal action. Speaking up Mr Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms. The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan. Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was \"not at all surprised\" by the revelations about Mr Weinstein, a major backer of Democratic candidates. Many Democratic lawmakers have since vowed to give their contributions from Mr Weinstein to charity.

On 6 June 1944, around 156,000 troops, mainly from Britain, the US and Canada, landed in Nazi-occupied France. The huge force broke through the German army's defences and began an attack that would eventually take them all the way to the German capital, Berlin.

The move comes exactly two months after the devastating earthquake and tsunami. Earlier Tepco said it had found another leak of highly contaminated water into the sea but was able to halt the flow. A Tepco spokesman said workers stopped a leak into a storage pit, which lay outside reactor No 3 and within metres of the ocean. A similar leak at the Fukushima Daiichi plant's reactor No 2 was sealed in April with a special chemical known as liquid glass. The plant has been leaking radiation since the 11 March earthquake and subsequent tsunami damaged cooling systems at the six-reactor plant. More than 80,000 local residents living within a 20km (12 mile) radius of the plant have been evacuated from their homes. Agriculture and businesses have been hit and there is no timescale yet for allowing residents to return - Tepco has said that it may take up to nine months to achieve a cold shut-down at the plant. Tepco is seeking a 2 trillion yen ($24.8bn) loan to see it through the initial emergency. It also expects to pay 50 billion yen ($620m) in initial compensation to those evacuated around the plant. Overall damages are unknown but are expected to be much higher. The government is considering establishing a new body to deal with the payments in case they exceed Tepco's ability to pay.

Why was the UK given a warning? Under EU law, when air pollution limits are breached member states must implement air quality plans to bring the levels back down. The commission says the UK failed to address repeated breaches of legal air pollution limits for nitrogen dioxide levels in 16 areas including London, Birmingham, Leeds, Southampton and Glasgow. It says if the UK fails to act within two months, it could take the matter to the European Court of Justice. The UK could face a lump sum fine or a daily penalty payment decided by the court. The commission says more than 400,000 people die prematurely in the EU every year as a result of poor air quality. How does the UK compare with the rest of Europe? Germany, France, Spain and Italy were also served with warnings. To date, legal action on NO2 has been taken against 12 member states, the commission says, with ongoing infringement cases against Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK. The commission says air quality standards are being exceeded in 23 out of 28 member states - including more than 130 cities across Europe. What are your solutions for air pollution? What does the European Commission say should be done? It suggests possible measures to lower polluting emissions include reducing overall traffic volumes and switching to electric cars.

The officer, identified as PC Y, denied gross misconduct, saying he believed her rape claim was \"sexual fantasy\".

The panel said PC Y, who joined the police in 1996, abused his position when he revealed to the woman he was a police officer and sent her a photo of himself in uniform to gain her trust. Representing Avon and Somerset Police, Briony Ballard said even one instance of an officer abusing his position for sex was \"a betrayal\".

Ms Ballard said: \"She told you she had previously been raped.

The density of O2, for example, is probably about five trillion times less dense than the oxygen that blankets Earth. The presence of an exosphere, as it is more properly called, was confirmed by instruments on the Cassini probe which orbits the ringed planet and its moons. The discovery is reported in the online version of Science magazine. Oxygen exospheres have been seen at Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede, but this is the first time such a detection has been made in the Saturnian system. Ben Teolis and colleagues say the tenuous envelope around Rhea is maintained by high-energy particles that constantly bombard the moon's icy surface. \"As the magnetic field rotates around Saturn, particles carried in the field slam into the hemisphere of Rhea that's facing their flow,\" Dr Teolis from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, US, told BBC News. \"They hit that hemisphere and break water molecules on the surface. The atoms are then rearranging themselves to make O2 molecules, which are sputtered from the surface by additional impacting particles.\" It is an ongoing process. As fast as the oxygen is created, energetic processes around Rhea are whipping the O2 molecules out into space. The mechanism driving the production of carbon dioxide is less obvious, say the researchers. Some of it, like the O2, could be being produced as a result of high-energy particle impacts. Such CO2 could certainly result if organic compounds are present in the surface ice. It is possible also that the carbon dioxide was made in deep sub-surface processes and the CO2 is slowly escaping the moon's body. Previous efforts to try to identify an exosphere at Rhea using Earth telescopes and even the remote-sensing instruments on Cassini had failed. Only by getting up close to Rhea could Cassini make a positive detection. \"What we've been able to do now with Cassini is actually fly through this atmosphere an\n\nSummary:","298":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Reading Crown Court also heard graphic details of 40 injuries she had suffered with a claw hammer. Brown, 47, of Winkfield, admits killing his wife but denies murder. He also denies obstructing a coroner from holding an inquest. Mrs Brown's body was found buried on the Queen's Windsor Estate on 5 November 2010, four days after she was reported missing. 'Secluded corner' Pathologist Ashley Fegan-Earl told the court the mother-of-two sustained injuries to her hands and arms as she defended herself against the attack and suffered fractures only usually seen in road accidents. The court heard earlier how British Airways pilot Mr Brown had dug a grave in a secluded corner of the site weeks before the murder on 31 October last year. On the night of the attack, after dropping their two children at his new girlfriend's house, he allegedly dragged the body to the site and dumped it in a coffin-sized plastic garden crate modified to make it waterproof. Mr Brown put his hands over his eyes as the court was shown the box where Mrs Brown, an upmarket guest house owner originally from the Isle of Man, was found wrapped in a bin bag and zipped inside a black surfboard bag. Inside the crate with the body, police found two pairs of latex gloves, blood-stained duct tape, cable ties and a mallet. Forensic archaeologist Professor John Hunter said judging by the root growth in the 4ft-deep (1.2m) hole and the slumping of the sides, it would have been dug \"at least a few weeks\" before Mrs Brown's body was dumped. The jury was sent home until Monday. The trial continues.\n\nSummary:","299":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

There's something visceral about their sound, which can make your hair stand on end during a horrifying film sequence. In Joker, the cello conveys the inner turmoil of Joaquin Phoenix's character Arthur Fleck, as he contorts into a murderous clown. The film's soundtrack is the work of Icelandic composer and cellist Hildur Gudnadottir - the only woman nominated for best score at this year's Oscars. Anyone who's seen the film will know the music plays an integral part. \"Joker is the story of basically one person, so it felt fitting that one instrument was leading the way into his head, leading us forward,\" she tells BBC News. Of all the instruments at her disposal, she chose the cello. \"It's my instrument, so it was convenient as I played it on the soundtrack,\" she says. Hildur was lured into working on the Joker origin film by director Todd Phillips, and she recalls: \"The script was just fantastic - it struck me very hard.\" She collaborated on Arthur's transformation into Joker with Phillips and Phoenix, the favourite to win best actor at the Oscars. \"I fell in love with the film and wrote all the main themes before they started shooting, so they were able to use that music, and I was able to be a part of that.\" Hildur's music was pivotal to a key early scene in the film - the \"bathroom dance\" where Arthur, dressed as Joker, begins to inhabit his alter ego. Her score triggered an unexpected response in Phoenix. In the half-light of a bathroom, he slowly twists his arms in a series of oddly balletic poses as a haunting cello solo plays. It makes for compelling, if creepy viewing. \"Joaquin was basically responding in real time to the music - the scene wasn't scripted like this at all,\" she said. \"The scene in the bathroom where he's being led by the music and improvises a dance, it was just bas\n\nSummary:","302":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

MP Tim Farron called it a \"slap in the face\" while one trade union leader said it was like \"rewarding the captain of the Titanic for jumping ship\". Network Rail admitted the \"timing is difficult\" given the current issues. Passengers have faced delays and cancellations since a major overhaul of rail timetables took effect on 20 May. Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, has laid some of the blame for recent disruption at Network Rail's door, saying the organisation had been \"very late\" in approving the new timetables. The chairman of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy, said Mr Carne had made a \"tremendous contribution\" to the UK's railways over his four-and-a-half years in the role. Since he was appointed chief executive in January 2014, Mr Carne, a former oil executive, has overseen a large investment programme, including the rebuilding of London Bridge and Birmingham New Street stations and the upgrading of signalling systems, as well as the Crossrail and Thameslink projects. He announced in February he would leave Network Rail later this year. 'Pantomime' Emily Yates, of the Association of British Commuters, called the award a \"pantomime\", adding it is \"a sign that the rail industry is really out of touch with the real pain and suffering that people are going through\".

One man even donated his own personal collection of Sheffield-made blades. The Ken Hawley Collection now has about 1,500 stainless steel knives made by about 1,000 different makers. Nick Duggan, an archive volunteer, said: \"We have had a staggering 110 people contact us with a story about their ancestor being involved and we had many Sheffield-made knives donated.\" The online archive has given \"a new momentum to the search and has taken it world-wide\", added Mr Duggan. Caroline Sage, a descendant of cutlery-maker George Bishop, told the archive how three generations of her family were named after a special pattern called Iviene. \"My daughter, my mother and my grandmother were all named after the cutlery. \"My grandma, who was George Bishop's granddaughter, was named Iviena after the [decorative] pattern. Sharing the information about our family's link was a nice thing to do.\" Dr Richard Brown donated more than 70 examples that yielded 11 knives by previously unknown Sheffield makers, said Mr Duggan. Another nine were by known makers for which the archive had no example of their work, he added. Dr Brown, originally from London, amassed his collection during several years of combing antique shops. \"There are still a large number of manufacturer's buildings still around in the city, even though most have long since ceased to operate\", said Dr Brown.

The deal will make Toshiba the world's biggest POS system provider. \"Toshiba Tec enjoys a strong presence in retail store solutions in Asia-Pacific, including Japan, and we are confident that this acquisition will support expansion in North America, Europe and the emerging economies,\" said Norio Sasaki, Toshiba's president and chief executive. \"I also expect this significant step to support innovation and the creation of new business opportunities for Toshiba Group.\" IBM's retail store solutions business had revenues of $1.15bn in 2011 and employs approximately 1,000 workers worldwide. Twin factors Analysts said while Toshiba was looking to increase its presence in the sector, other factors may have also played a part in its decision, not least a strong Japanese currency. The yen has risen 12% against the US dollar in the past 12 months, giving Japanese firms greater purchasing power. That has resulted in Japanese companies going on a buying spree. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, Japanese companies did more than 600 such deals in 2011, spending nearly $70bn on them. \"The strong yen is definitely a factor here,\" Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology Japan told the BBC. At the same time, Japanese firms have had to deal with a stagnant domestic economy and an ageing population, factors which have forced them to look beyond Japan for growth. \"The only way for these firms to grow is by acquiring businesses that have a global presence,\" said Mr Fasol.\n\nSummary:","305":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It is estimated survival rates have improved by 30%. It started at the old Frenchay hospital before moving to the new \u00a3430m Southmead super-hospital four miles away in 2014. A cluster of six other hospitals - including Bristol Royal Infirmary - operate as major trauma units in a network around it. But Southmead, one of 27 MTCs across England, is in line to take the most critical cases first - involving up to 1,500 patients a year. Dr Ben Walton, consultant in intensive care medicine, said it offered a consistency of service which was not possible before. \"The feeling when these centres were first set up in London it would take five years to see improvements - we've seen it in 18 months,\" he said. \"In the past, if a patient was seriously injured in a road traffic collision or fell at home, they'd be taken to the nearest hospital with an emergency unit. \"Now, if they fulfil certain criteria and the assessment of the ambulance or pre-hospital doctor crew is that they're likely to have a serious injury, they will by-pass their nearest emergency department and be transferred directly to the major trauma centre.\" Dr Walton said the major trauma centre could gather together multiple specialists around the clock and deal with injuries which are often complex. \"Patients are met by a trauma team which is 24\/7, 365 days of the year and there will always be a senior clinician - a consultant - leading that team. \"That's of benefit to patients and can't be provided at every hospital, it's impossible.\" There is a flow of patients between the other trauma units and the MTC, depending on the seriousness of their condition and stage of their care.

The case could lead to further claims if other vulnerable asylum seekers can prove they have links to the UK. Campaigners said the decision was groundbreaking, although the Home Office may appeal. The three 16-year-olds, who in legal terms are classed as children, have been living in the so-called \"Jungle\" camp for at least two months. The fourth claimant is the 26-year-old brother of one of the other three and suffers from a serious mental illness. All four had fled the Syrian civil war, saying they had witnessed traumatic events including bombings and death. Two of them were detained and tortured by the Syrian government. None of them had been able to make effective asylum claims in France - but they all have adult brothers who are legally settled in the UK as recognised refugees. Lawyers told judges at the Immigration and Asylum Tribunal earlier this week that the group were suffering \"intolerable\" conditions in the massive and unsanitary camp and were desperate to be reunited safely with their siblings.

Profits for the six-month period came in at \u00a310m, down 36% from a year ago. Mulberry warned in October that profits would fall short of expectations due to weak international demand, including a drop in wholesale orders from Asia. 'Challenging environment' The British company, some of whose handbags cost \u00a34,500 each, repeated that its wholesale business was facing \"a more challenging external environment in Asia, resulting in cautious ordering by franchise partners\". However, chief executive Bruno Guillon said that he expected wholesale sales to rebound in the New Year. Retail sales growth meanwhile was 7% on a like-for-like basis - excluding the effect of changes in floorspace - compared with the 26% growth rate seen in 2011. However, the firm said this growth rate had picked up in October and November, reaching 11%. On top of the slowdown in sales, Mulberry also revealed a squeeze in its profit margins, due to the cost of employing higher quality materials and manufacturing techniques for its goods. \"The UK retail business and key wholesale accounts have continued to perform well in the context of a challenging economic environment,\" said Mr Guillon. \"During the period, we have rationalised certain wholesale accounts and refocused the outlet business, which has impacted financial performance in the short term.

Clashes were also taking place in nearby Sadad, a mostly Christian town. The latest development comes amid air campaigns in Syria by Russia and a US-led coalition. IS has been expanding from its mainly northern and eastern strongholds towards Homs in central Syria in recent months. The group overran the town of Tadmur - home to the ancient ruins of Palmyra - in May, and later took al-Qaryatain town in August. The latest offensive on Maheen and Sadad brings IS to within 20km (13 miles) of the main road that links the Syrian capital Damascus to Homs and other cities further north. Christian population The Observatory said at least 50 government soldiers were killed or wounded in the fighting. The attack on Maheen began late on Saturday with twin suicide car bombs, a favoured tactic for IS militants launching an assault. By Sunday morning the Observatory reported that the whole town was reported to be in IS hands. An IS statement also said the group had taken the town. Maheen is home to a large military complex and arms depot. Meanwhile, clashes between government troops and IS are said to be continuing on the outskirts of Sadad. The town is reportedly home to 15,000 people, mostly Syriac Orthodox Christians, and has 14 churches and a monastery. The fighting comes amid continued Russian air strikes in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which Russian officials say are targeting IS and other \"terrorist groups\".

The couple, who live in Abergavenny, are appealing the decision. The Home Office said it was considering Mrs Waterman's appeal and the new information she had provided. Mr Waterman, 56, uses a wheelchair and has regular seizures after having a severe stroke in September 2015 when living in the Philippines. After spending more than a month in hospital, Mr Waterman and his wife and children - now seven and 10, visited family in Monmouthshire in December 2015. Shortly afterwards Mr Waterman developed seizures and the couple decided to stay near his family for support. On the expiry of Mrs Waterman's visitor's visa in July 2016, she applied to remain in the country. She said a solicitor told her she could make the application from the UK because the deterioration in her husband's health would be considered \"exceptional circumstances\". But the Home Office rejected the application in August. If Mrs Waterman's appeal is unsuccessful she will have to travel to the Philippines to apply for a new visa, either leaving her family or taking the children away from their father. Mr Waterman, who can communicate with the help of an app, said he was \"mad, sad and disappointed\" with the decision.\n\nSummary:","318":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Its publisher Time Inc UK said the decision to stop its print edition is due to rising production costs and a \"tough\" advertising market. Instead, it will be \"focusing investment on further expanding NME's digital audience\". The magazine launched in 1952 and has featured global superstars on the front including David Bowie, Oasis, Dua Lipa, Amy Winehouse and Sam Smith. Its website launched in 1997 and the magazine went free in September 2015. The hashtag \"RIP NME\" has been trending on Twitter - with several musicians sharing images of when they were on the front cover. Fans of the magazine have also been reacting to the news. Time Inc's UK group managing director Paul Cheal said: \"NME is one of the most iconic brands in British media and our move to free print has helped to propel the brand to its biggest ever audience on NME.com. \"The print reinvention has helped us to attract a range of cover stars that the previous paid-for magazine could only have dreamed of. \"At the same time, we have also faced increasing production costs and a very tough print advertising market. \"Unfortunately we have now reached a point where the free weekly magazine is no longer financially viable.\" NME will continue to publish special issues in print, such as its new paid-for series NME Gold.

Tonga is made up of over 170 islands in the Pacific Ocean, east of Australia. A team from the Sea Education Association and Nasa visited the small land mass in October, having previously kept watch through satellite imaging. How exactly was the island formed? Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai - named after the two islands it is nestled between - was born in December 2014 after a submarine volcano erupted, sending a stream of steam, ash and rock into the air. When the ash finally settled, it interacted with the seawater and solidified. A month later, the new island was formed. It isn't uncommon for underwater volcanic eruptions to form little islands, but they usually have shorter life-spans. Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai is one of just three to emerge in the last 150 years that have lasted more than a few months. \"In this case, the ash seemed to have a chemical reaction with the seawater that allowed it to solidify more than it usually would,\" volcanologist Jess Phoenix told the BBC. She compares the island to Surtsey, an island in Iceland that was formed in a similar way in the 1960s, and is still around today. What did scientists find when they got there? Nasa researcher Dan Slayback was among those who visited the island in October, and said they were \"all like giddy school children\". He found a light-coloured, sticky clay mud on the volcanic mass - something that left him mystified. \"We didn't really know what it was and I'm still a little baffled of where it's coming from,\" Mr Slayback said in a recent Nasa blog post. According to Ms Phoenix, the animal and plant life is easier to explain. \"It's not at all surprising that there's vegetation growing actually,\" she said. \"It's likely that it was transported by animals - most likely through bird droppings - and volcanic land is pretty fertile\".

Mr Yentob said the murder of a boy who had been using Kids Company's services took place five days after it shut. He said it was related to \"the absence of a place for these children to go\". The leaders of Kids Company, which had worked with vulnerable young people, also denied claims of financial mismanagement during the Public Administration Select Committee hearing. The charity collapsed in August days after receiving a \u00a33m grant from the Cabinet Office and in the midst of a Scotland Yard investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse. The closure came after ministers said they wanted to recover the grant - with officials saying they believed conditions attached to the use of the money had not been met. 'Kiss of death' The pair claimed the charity would not have folded if there had not been \"malicious allegations\" of sexual abuse. \"Only our finance person and the Cabinet Office knew that the money had hit our account. Suddenly out of the blue we get allegations that we don't even know relate to sexual abuse,\" said Ms Batmanghelidjh. \"That was the kiss of death for a charity dealing with children.\" Mr Yentob said that while he believed the allegations had not come from \"anywhere near the Cabinet Office\", he believed the leak was malicious.

The following morning, Mrs Seery was called by doctors who said her husband was \"not going to make it\". \"It was horrendous,\" she said, adding: \"I was pacing up and down waiting for the phone to ring again, but also not wanting it to ring as I didn't want to hear what they might have to say.\" Before she could get to hospital, his low oxygen levels started to improve and he was getting better. But several days later she got another call saying \"he is going\" and would she want to go to the hospital and, while wearing protective equipment, hold his hand. \"Straight away I said yes and they said they would call me back with more information, but they never did,\" Mrs Seery said. \"I didn't know it but he was picking up then.

Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Support for shielders, such as food and medicine deliveries, will continue. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. In England, those shielding will be advised that they can go outside once a day, with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance. In Wales, outdoor exercise for people shielding will be unlimited. Those shielding should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. Around 2.5 million UK people were advised to stay at home as lockdown began, because they were identified as being at particularly high risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus symptoms. Most were notified by their GP. The list of people who should be shielding includes solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma. Some people shielding to be allowed outdoors Not all elderly people were asked to shield. Some were later removed from the shielding list if they no longer met the requirements.

Experts say the results, while not conclusive, appear to back current advice that babies should be exclusively breastfed for six months. But they say mothers should still have a choice about whether or not to do it. Regarding the findings - published in The Lancet Global Health - they stress there are many different factors other than breastfeeding that could have an impact on intelligence, although the researchers did try to rule out the main confounders, such as mother's education, family income and birth weight. Dr Bernardo Lessa Horta, from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, said his study offers a unique insight because in the population he studied, breastfeeding was evenly distributed across social class - not something just practised by the rich and educated. Most of the babies, irrespective of social class, were breastfed - some for less than a month and others for more than a year. Those who were breastfed for longer scored higher on measures of intelligence as adults. They were also more likely to earn a higher wage and to have completed more schooling. Long-term impact Dr Horta believes breast milk may offer an advantage because it is a good source of long-chain saturated fatty acids which are essential for brain development. But experts say the study findings cannot confirm this and that much more research is needed to explore any possible link between breastfeeding and intelligence. Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing, Public Health England, said there was strong evidence that breastfeeding provides some health benefits for babies - reduced respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in infancy, for example. He said: \"PHE's advice remains that exclusive breastfeeding for around the first six months of life provides health benefits to babies. \"We recognise\n\nSummary:","326":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Supporters say the decision effectively marks the end of the proposal, while Inox said a \"miracle\" was needed. International support A petition of nearly 5,000 signatures in favour of the stadium was handed in to County Hall before the meeting. Ian Connell, chairman of the Cornish Pirates rugby club, said: \"We are hugely disappointed. The decision was greeted with total dismay from supporters, some as far afield as New Zealand.\" Rob Saltmarsh, the managing director of Inox, said: \"I can't see a way forward.

At least one draws attention to the upcoming trial of activist Najla Hariri, who was arrested after posting a video of herself driving on YouTube. Joy and jubilation Initial reactions on Facebook to King Abdallah's announcement are almost all positive and express gratitude to the royal family for their role in the reforms. Commenting on \"We are all Manal al-Sharif\" - a Facebook page set up in support of another Saudi rights activist who was arrested after posting a video of herself driving a car - user \"Noor Ali\" writes: \"God protect you, O Sheikh\", referring to King Abdallah. Other users simply say \"Thank God\" or \"Congratulations\" on posts announcing the news. On a post on the \"Saudi Women Driving Campaign\" page, \"Bana Jomaa\" writes \"we're getting there inshallah we're getting all our rights\", showing how quick Saudis were to notice that their original demand has not been addressed. More reforms soon? Despite the positive reaction, many Saudi social media users are sceptical about the move.

The Peak District is dominated by ash so without intervention the area could be devastated by the disease, said NE. Joe Alsop, from NE, said planting using drones had not been done on any of its sites in the Peak District before. 'Challenging' The project will focus on several woodlands and there are plans for about 200,000 trees to be planted. Mr Alsop, senior reserve manager at the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve, said the drone planting trial would be done towards the end of the five-year project, probably in 2024 or 2025. He said tree seeds would be wrapped in a small ball of fertilizer and specially-adapted drones would broadcast them on the planting site. \"We will probably trial it on a range of different sites where planting will be really challenging,\" he said, adding the use of drones was \"experimental\". \"We don't know how effective it will be,\" he said. \"We are not relying on it.\" Mr Alsop said he understood drone planting had been done elsewhere in the UK but he did not believe it had been done in the Peak District before. NE said the ravine forests of the Peak District have high levels of ash dieback infection and have lost mature trees. The organisation said although lime and wych elm trees are being planted in the spaces when ash have died, they won't give up on ash and will find species that might be resilient to the disease. The project has received \u00a33.6m in funding from the EU Life programme, as well as funding from the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, the National Trust and the Chatsworth Estate.

Saudi air defences did not stop the drones and missiles because they were pointed southwards, to prevent attacks from Yemen, they added. Iran denies involvement in the attacks, which disrupted global oil supplies. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi rebels said they had launched the drones that struck the Abqaiq oil processing plant, the world's largest, and the Khurais oilfield. They have launched attacks into Saudi Arabia before, but US officials said on Sunday they believed the drones and missiles did not originate from the south or south-west, and instead were launched from the north or north-west. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the attack a reciprocal act by the \"Yemeni people\". Oil prices soared 20% after the attacks, at one point reaching $71.95 (\u00a357.53) a barrel. But they have since pared their gains as it appeared market disruption would not be as bad as feared. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said he expected production to be fully back online by the end of the month, adding that half the production at the damaged facilities had already been restored. Brent crude - the international benchmark used by traders - was trading at about $64 (\u00a351.20) after the announcement. What has the US said?

The family's car got stuck in the taiga - a vast swathe of coniferous forest with large areas of boggy ground - leaving them with no choice but to call the emergency services, Ren TV reports.

We were shooting and making noise for about two hours so that the predators did not come close.\" Happily, despite the setting and a temperature hovering around 5C, Mrs Matrosova delivered a healthy baby girl.

But Water UK says it is \"not convinced\" and Severn Trent Water has refused the council a \"trade effluent\" permit. The cremation company Resomation says waste water does not contain human DNA. On the company's website its founder Sandy Sullivan explains that after the cremation, liquid is \"safely returned to the water cycle free from any traces of DNA\". But a source at Water UK, a membership organisation that works with water companies on industry standards, said it had \"serious concerns about the public acceptability of this\". \"It is the liquefied remains of the dead going into the water system. We don't think the public will like the idea.\" The process of \"water cremation\" involves a body being placed in a metal chamber, where it is reduced to liquid and ash using a process known as alkaline hydrolysis. The process, which takes three to four hours, has not yet been used in the UK, although it is operational in a number of US states. Resomation says the process produces a third less greenhouse gas than cremation, needs a seventh of the energy and allows for the complete separation of dental amalgam and bodily implants for safe disposal. Mercury from crematoria is believed to be the cause of 16% of UK airborne mercury emissions. Sandwell Council, in Oldbury, West Midlands, which is working to offer water cremation at Rowley Regis crematorium, said it hoped to \"offer people more choice\".

It comes after criticism that the national system was not tapping into local knowledge. The approach has been used in virus hotspots like Blackburn and Luton. And it's now being offered to all councils that are responsible for public health in their area. Test and trace is staffed by NHS clinicians and people who were trained to become contact tracers during the pandemic. NHS staff who offer advice to people who have tested positive for coronavirus will not be laid off. But the national service will shrink from 18,000 contact tracers to 12,000 with the remaining non-NHS call handlers redeployed as part of dedicated local test and trace teams, the Department of Health says. This means local areas will have \"ring-fenced teams\" from the national test and trace service. Another 200 walk-in testing centres will also open by October. As part of NHS Test and Trace, public health teams dealing with outbreaks in factories or care homes have consistently reached more than 90% of the contacts on their lists. Outside of those very localised outbreaks, it is call centres who trace contacts. But they don't reach as many contacts - their success rate for reaching contacts who don't live together peaked at just over 70% in the middle of July, but has fallen since then. A return to old-fashioned contact tracing? In May, the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, announced that an \"army\" of contact tracers would be recruited for the NHS Test and Trace service.

He described the accord as a bad deal and said his pro fossil fuel policies had made the US an energy superpower. The earliest he can formally start the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord is 4 November. The pull-out will take effect a year later - the day after the 2020 US presidential election. The Paris agreement brought together 195 nations in the battle to combat climate change. It committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. President Trump said if he couldn\u2019t improve that deal he\u2019d pull out, but diplomatic sources said there\u2019s been no major effort at renegotiation. A seek-and-destroy mission In the meantime, the president\u2019s staff have conducted what critics call a seek-and-destroy mission through US environmental legislation. Mr Trump promised that he\u2019d turn the US into an energy superpower, and he\u2019s attempting to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He categorised former US President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. The gas and oil industries are indeed thriving, but Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to resurrect the coal industry has proved much more challenging. Coal can't compete on price with gas - or, for that matter, with renewables whose costs have plummeted. Firms are also reluctant to invest billions in coal-fired plants which could have a limited life if the next administration rejoins the rest of the world on climate change. As coal is the dirtiest fuel, the industry\u2019s woes have held down US emissions, despite the President\u2019s policies.

This figure has been rising in recent years. The EA clarified the financial position of schools in response to an enquiry from the UUP MLA Rosemary Barton. There are just over 1,000 schools in Northern Ireland, all of which are given a yearly budget allocation by the EA. Most of their funding is based on pupil numbers, but there are a number of other factors that decide how much money they get. Collectively, 451 schools went over budget by a total of \u00a362.6m in the 2018\/19 school year. The bulk of a school's budget is spent on employing teaching staff. There have been a number of warnings about the impact of financial pressures on schools, most recently from the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee of MPs. In August, the Institute for Fiscal Studies also said that Northern Ireland had faced the highest cuts to school spending in the UK. 'Perilous situation' Ms Barton said that many schools were in a \"perilous\" situation. \"From regularly talking to school principals across the country, I know that they have cut costs in almost every area,\" she said \"Class sizes have grown, extra-curricular activities have been cancelled and valued staff have unfortunately been let go. \"Yet despite all those actions a record number of schools are now being left with no choice but to spend money that they simply do not have.\" A spokesperson for the Education Authority said schools and other services to children and young people needed more funding. \"We have been highlighting and acknowledging the financial challenges facing schools and the wider education sector for some time,\" they said.\n\nSummary:","346":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Abdelbaset al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted over the bombing of Pan Am 103 in 1988. The plane was on its way from London to New York on 21 December when it exploded above Lockerbie. A total of 270 people died in the bombing, including everyone on board the plane and 11 people from the Scottish town. Megrahi, who was found guilty of mass murder and jailed for a minimum of 27 years, died in 2012 after being released from jail on compassionate grounds in 2009. He had terminal cancer. Stephanie Bernstein, a US citizen whose husband was among those killed in the attack, said she was \"surprised, delighted and really gratified\" by the news that two further suspects had been identified. \"There are many, many people who I hope are not sleeping so well tonight knowing that the Scottish government and the US government are committed to pursuing this case,\" she said. Frank Duggan, president of Pan Am 103 Relatives, which represents many of the US victims of the bombing, said he was not confident there would be further prosecutions. \"It's been 26 years. It's too long, people are dead, stories have been forgotten,\" he said. \"I'd like to think that it will be one small measure of closure but I don't expect the kind of justice that we all hope for.\" But Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter died in the bombing, claimed that any prosecution would \"need to be supported by very much better evidence\" than that used against Megrahi, who Dr Swire believes was not responsible for the attack.

Nesbo is the latest contemporary author to be commissioned by the Hogarth Shakespeare project to rewrite the Bard's works for a 21st Century audience. The best-selling Norwegian author said the play's dark themes did not \"feel too far from home\". The project launches in 2016 to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. \"Macbeth is a story that is close to my heart because it tackles topics I've been dealing with since I started writing,\" Nesbo said. The tragic protagonist of 'The Scottish Play', he continued, was \"a main character who has the moral code and the corrupted mind, the personal strength and the emotional weakness, the ambition and the doubts to go either way.\" He described Macbeth as \"a thriller about the struggle for power, set both in a gloomy, stormy crime noir-like setting and in a dark, paranoid human mind. \"I will not attempt to do justice to William Shakespeare nor the story,\" he went on. \"I will simply take what I find of use and write my own story. \"And, yes, I will have the nerve to call it Macbeth.\" Nesbo's books have sold more than 20 million copies worldwide. The Harry Hole novels include The Snowman, The Leopard, Phantom and, most recently, Police. Already announced as authors on the new Hogarth Shakespeare list are Margaret Atwood, Howard Jacobson, Anne Tyler and Jeanette Winterson.

Fullscreen describes itself as a \"modern media company\", part talent agency, part content producer. It has a roster of 75,000 \"partners\", predominantly recruited through YouTube. The company has traditionally made money by brokering advertising deals for its talent, providing support to smaller video-makers in exchange for a cut of their ad revenue, and by selling tour tickets and merchandise for its biggest stars. But it said it had needed to create its own subscription video platform to let video-makers \"fulfil their artistic ambition\". \"Social media is a great place to make quick, inexpensive content to engage a fanbase,\" Fullscreen founder George Strompolos told the BBC. \"But when it comes to longer form or premium productions, the economics of producing it on the free web just don't work out. \"We needed to create a premium destination for that work that has a higher quality.\" Consumers are increasingly rejecting expensive cable television packages and instead subscribing to individual streaming services, known as over-the-top services.

He was arrested in 1605 after the failed attempt to blow up Parliament and kill King James I. Oldcorne was later executed, despite no evidence linking him to the assassination attempt. The crucifix was found after troops discovered the Jesuit hiding inside a priest hole at Hindlip Hall - a stately home in Worcestershire. It is now on display at the Bar Convent Living Heritage Centre. 'Historic event' Sister Patricia Harriss described the cross housed in a wooden case as \"one of the most remarkable items in our possession.\" \"Today, Bonfire Night is a celebration with fireworks but in 1605 it was an event that had a profound effect on Catholics and shocked the whole country,\" she said. \"This crucifix, now more than 400 years old, was hidden in the priest's hole with Blessed Edward Oldcorne and would have offered him comfort in his final days. \"It is incredible that it has survived and can now be used to tell the story of these men and of this extraordinary historic event that has such strong links to the city of York.\" Father Oldcorne was hung, drawn and quartered in 1606 in a crackdown on the Catholic faith in the aftermath of the Gunpowder Plot. He was beatified, the first step to becoming a saint, by the Vatican in 1929. The Jesuit priest had attended St Peter's School in York, alongside Fawkes and fellow plotters Christopher and John Wright.

The earlier collections will be picked up by delivery staff as part of their existing rounds. The majority of those switching as part of today's announcement will be in urban and suburban areas, with an indicator tab showing whether a collection has been made. Post men and women empty some 12,000 postboxes in rural areas and many of the new boxes will be targeted at these areas, the company said. Royal Mail said many post boxes no longer cover their costs: \"Rather than decommission uneconomic postboxes, while staying within the regulated density requirement, Royal Mail will ensure their viability by improving the efficiency of its collections arrangements.\" Alternative providers? The regulator, Ofcom, requires Royal Mail to have post boxes within half a mile of 98% of households. In response to the new plans it said: \"Ofcom recognises the need for Royal Mail to become more efficient so it can sustain a universal postal service that consumers value highly.\" \"While the changes won't affect the majority of postal users, Ofcom expects Royal Mail to communicate clearly with any affected consumers and ensure that their reasonable needs continue to be met,\" the statement said. Ofcom reviewed customers' attitude to posting times last year and found that 91% of postal users did not choose a postal box based on collection time. Alexander Jackman, head of policy at the Forum of Private Business said: \"As Royal Mail faces increasing competition, it's understandable that the service needs to be a leaner operation. \"However, as businesses see service levels decline while postage costs continue to rise it is inevitable that many will look for alternative providers if that's an option for them.\"\n\nSummary:","355":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Prof Martin Cowie, who led the UK-based part of the study, said it could save up to 10,000 lives each year. The trial involved more than 6,500 people in 37 countries who already used standard treatments such as beta-blocker drugs. Over a typical study period of two years, ivabradine cut the risk of death from heart failure by 26%. It had a similar impact on the likelihood of patients being admitted to hospital. The research findings were presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual meeting in Stockholm. More than 700,000 people over the age of 45 are thought to live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Heart failure uses up 1% to 2% of the total NHS budget and direct medical costs alone amounting to \u00a3625m each year. Unlike other treatments, such as beta-blockers, ivabradine lowers the number of heartbeats per minute without also reducing blood pressure. 'Clinical breakthrough' Prof Cowie, a consultant cardiologist at London's Royal Brompton Hospital, described as conservative estimates that 10,000 deaths could be prevented in the UK by prescribing the drug to eligible patients. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that one in four people in the UK could develop heart failure in some point in their lives. The drug worked by slowing the pulse down so that it helped to take some of the strain off the heart, he said. \"For people who have heart failure, their heart is always going too fast. Even when they are sitting doing nothing, their heart rate might be going along at 80 or 90 beats per minute and this drug helps slow that down,\" he added. \"In the past we have been able to do that with drugs called beta blockers... but many patients can't take beta blockers because they have asthma or it drops their blood pressure. \"This drug has the advantage that it can be added to beta blockers or it can be given t\n\nSummary:","357":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Making them public would not help \"public confidence in the immigration system\", he told LBC Radio. Ministers were contradicting themselves and were \"in a hopeless mess\" over the issue, Labour's Chris Bryant said. People from Romania and Bulgaria have been free to live in the UK and anywhere else in the EU since 2007, but in the UK have either had to apply for one of the limited work permits available, been self-employed or worked in a specific list of jobs such as seasonal agricultural ones and domestic servants. According to the ONS, in July 2012 there were 94,000 people who were born in Romania and 47,000 people who were born in Bulgaria resident in the UK. Ministers say that the impact of the transitional controls, and the fact that eight other EU countries will see those restrictions end at the same time as the UK at the end of 2013, make forecasts difficult. Speaking on his weekly LBC phone-in show, Mr Clegg said the government had \"estimates, but they are estimates\", adding, when asked to reveal them: \"I don't think it helps public confidence in the immigration system.\" He said: \"I don't think we as a government should start bandying around estimates, estimates which at the moment aren't very precise.\" 'Publish impact assessment' The then Labour government used a prediction of 13,000 arrivals when Poland and other countries joined the European Union in 2004 - a figure which was exceeded many times over. Asked whether the current estimate was more than 13,000 he replied: \"I can't give you clues... you are inviting me to get into a sort of guessing game about an estimate.\" The deputy prime minister added that Labour's incorrect prediction had \"undermined much of the fabric of public support for immigration\" and caused \"the loss of confidence\" in it. He added that \"one of the reasons that happened\" was because Labour \"were bandying around guesstimates\".

A full statement will be released in due course.\" In a statement on its website on January 11, the CFA said: \"Having taken advice and guidance from The FA it has been agreed that the incident does not fall within the jurisdiction of The Cornwall FA to issue charges via the Football judicial process\". It said the club had \"sincerely apologised\" to everyone affected, including \"supporters as well as anyone staying at the accommodation in Plymouth that night\". Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of \"an incident that appeared on social media that allegedly showed a football team from Cornwall having a party\", but it was not reported at the time. However, officers visited the property at a later date to speak to the owner of the letting. During the pandemic, fines have only been issued when supported by evidence captured by officers at the scene, so no action was taken against members of the football club, the police said.

In contrast, there were only nine in the whole of 2012. More than 5,000 properties have been flooded over this period, although the Environment Agency says investment in flood defences over the past decade has protected a further 1.3 million properties. 'Exceptional' Speaking ahead of the launch of a Met Office report - produced by the Centre of Ecology and Hydrology - into recent climatic events, Dame Julia said the UK had seen the \"most exceptional period of rainfall in 248 years\". Unsettled weather at this time of year was not unexpected - but the prolonged spell of rain, as well as the intensity and height of coastal waves, was \"very unusual\". \"We have records going back to 1766 and we have nothing like this,\" she said. \"We have seen some exceptional weather. We can't say it is unprecedented but it is exceptional.\" The report links the recent extreme weather in Europe and North America to \"perturbations\" in the North Atlantic and Pacific jet streams, partly emanating from changing weather patterns in South East Asia and \"associated with higher than normal ocean temperatures in that region\". \"The attribution of these changes to anthropogenic [caused by humans] global warming requires climate models of sufficient resolution to capture storms and their associated rainfall,\" it says.

But sometimes there can be legitimate business reasons to volunteer for a smaller pay packet, even if you are not a senior executive. Mr Pennycook said that long days and weekends working away from his family at the office last year had justified his \u00a33.6m total take-home pay in 2015. \"We've been through a difficult period which was very intense and I hope members would regard my remuneration as having been appropriate for that time,\" he told the BBC. But now, according to Co-op chairman Allen Leighton, the company's continued recovery represents an opportunity for his chief executive to take a pay cut. 'Refreshing lesson' Mr Pennycook has subsequently suggested he should not be held up as an example for other top executives. But Simon Walker, head of the Institute of Directors (IoD), called the decision \"refreshing\" and said the move should serve as a lesson for other company chiefs. \"The proactive steps taken today by Mr Pennycook and the Co-op's board should be a wake-up call to other companies,\" he said. \"Being open, honest and transparent about the salaries of senior executives can go a long way to restoring public trust in British businesses.\" Top executives faced withering scrutiny about their pay during the 2008 financial crisis, prompting a growing public examination of the relationship between chief executives' compensation and company performances. The Co-op's boss seems to be bucking the trend in this respect. Corporate bosses, particularly in the banking sector, have fought a rearguard action against losing their bonuses after the financial crisis caused a backlash against corporate largesse.

Earlier this week, police used water cannon to disperse demonstrators and there have been scuffles as officers tried to clear small tented camps set up by protestors. Last night, a Porsche garage was torched. On Thursday night a huge demonstration is planned. On Friday, protesters aim to stop world leaders getting into the summit. At Hamburg's police headquarters, there is an atmosphere of nervous tension. Teams of officers in minibuses drive in and out past lines of water cannon and police vans, parked up and ready for action. About 20,000 officers are on duty over the course of G20. The police, it seems, are taking no chances. They say up to 8,000 extremists, armed with home-made weapons, are targeting the city. \"Some of these militants will be very aggressive,\" said Ralf Martin Meyer, the chief of Hamburg police. \"In the last few days we've seized improvised weapons like slingshots, ball bearings and fire extinguishers filled with flammable liquid which were intended for use against police officers. \"The amount of tools and weapons we found make us very concerned.\" The police operation has divided opinion in Germany. Too many officers, too heavy handed, say those worried that the decision to seal off part of the city centre and keep protesters out is an infringement of Germans' right to peaceful protest. As mounted units patrol the area around the summit hall and workers in orange overalls use forklift trucks to place concrete blocks along the pavement, many question the wisdom of holding an event like this in a congested city centre. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel proposed that G20 summits should held regularly in the United Nations building in New York instead of being hosted by the country which holds the rotating presidency, citing high costs - suspected to be at least \u20ac150m (\u00a3130m) - and security concerns.

In a letter to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACoBA), the current First Minister, Mark Drakeford, said he did \"not feel that any action by me is necessary\". Mr Jones has denied any wrongdoing. The allegation that Mr Jones had breached the code related to accepting a job as a global advisory board member of GFG Alliance, the parent company of Liberty Steel. ACoBA raised concerns with Mr Jones, regarding his access to contacts and information from within the steel industry during his time in office. The body said there was a risk that such insight would give GFG Alliance an unfair commercial advantage. Writing to Mr Jones in October, the chair of ACoBA, Lord Eric Pickles said: \"The committee considers joining the GFG Alliance global advisory board whilst you are subject to the government's business appointment rules is contrary to its advice. \"As a consequence you are in breach of the government's business appointment rules.\" Allegations regarding serving or former Welsh Government ministers are subsequently referred to the current Welsh first minister, and former ministers must abide by the Code for two years after leaving office. Ignoring the advice of ACOBA is considered a breach of the ministerial code.

He faced questions after inspectors Estyn said a fifth of children were functionally illiterate when they arrived at secondary school. But Mr Jones said reforms for the under-sevens had won praise. At his weekly question time in the Senedd, he said he was confident the literacy and numeracy programmes would improve the figures contained in Estyn's annual report. The report says 20% of children start secondary school with a reading age below nine years and six months - generally considered the level of functional literacy. 'Damning indictment' Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones said the statistic was a \"damning indictment\" of the Welsh government. The first minister pointed out that Estyn's report covered a period when Plaid was in coalition with Labour. But the Plaid leader said Welsh Labour ministers had held the education portfolio for more than 12 years. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said Estyn had repeated criticisms it made last year. She said: \"When hospitals fail you tell this chamber it's the fault of the local health boards. \"When our schools fail you try to blame it on the local authority, you try to blame it on schools, you try to blame it on the head teacher, you just tried to blame it on Ieuan Wyn Jones - anybody but your own government.\" Mr Jones said extra funding for children from less well-off backgrounds - part of a budget deal agreed between Labour and the Lib Dems - would help pupils reach the desired standards. Estyn had praised the foundation phase for the under-sevens, said performance in most schools was mainly good and welcomed an improvement in well being, he said. \"Yes there are areas where there needs to be improvement, but let's not suggest everything is difficult in terms of education in Wales,\" he said.

Prime ministers, in a more understated manner, have also come to believe in British exceptionalism, the idea that Westminster is the mother parliament, and that the UK has a governing model and liberal values that set the global standard for others to follow, not least its former colonies. In the post-war Anglo-American order those ideas came together. In many ways, it was the product of Anglo-American exceptionalist thinking: the \"city upon a hill\" meets \"this sceptred isle\". Nato, the IMF, the World Bank and the Five Eyes intelligence community all stemmed from the Atlantic Charter signed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill in August 1941. The liberalised free trade system that flourished after the war is often called the Anglo-Saxon model. The post-world global architecture, diplomatic, mercantile and financial, was largely an English-speaking construct. In recent weeks, however, the Anglo-American order has looked increasingly weak and wobbly. The unexpectedly messy result of the British election makes it look still more fragile, like a historic edifice left tottering in the wake of a major quake. There is uncertainty in Westminster, and something nearing chaos in Washington because of Russian probe at the White House and on Capitol Hill. Neither Britain nor America can boast strong and stable governments. Neither have the look of global exemplars.

In a debate that took a full day from start to finish, members went through various options. The original proposition, by Senator Francis Le Gresley, asked ministers to reconsider their decision not to hold a full committee of inquiry. But that was changed with additions from Deputies Montfort Tadier and Bob Hill. They narrowed down what the inquiry should look at including specific questions about the care homes themselves, and the prosecution service. Members in favour of the inquiry said the victims of abuse need closure. They said there were still unanswered questions about how it was able to happen, and that people should be brought to account. Senator Jimmy Perchard said the States needed to make reparations to make sure this did not happen again. He said: \"There were people in this chamber in past decades who were aware of these allegations. \"There were members of our police force in past decades who were aware of these allegations. \"There were members judiciary in past decades who were aware of these allegations. \"I want to know why these people chose to turn a blind eye and ignore the cries of helpless children.\" Others thought an inquiry was needed to look into the action of police leading the investigation or to finally put some of the conspiracy theories to bed. Positive alternatives Politicians on the other side of the debate were not convinced that a public committee of inquiry would give the victims the outcome they wanted. They suggested what they thought might be more positive alternatives.

Donald Trump will continue to have a Republican majority ready and willing to confirm his executive and judicial appointments. The only question now is the size of his party's advantage. In the House of Representatives, however, the story is different. The path of least resistance for Democrats to a majority in that chamber led through educated suburban districts that had long voted for Republicans, but contained voters that may have been uneasy with Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. One by one, those districts were carried by the Democrats. In Virginia, Illinois and Florida, moderate Republicans lost. In places like Colorado, New Jersey, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York Democrats are poised for victory. It won't feel like the tsunami many on the left were hoping for, but a steadily rising tide is still lifting Democrats to enough victories to give them control of the House for the first time in eight years. With that comes the ability to stop the Trump legislative agenda in its tracks and puts some teeth in congressional oversight of his administration.

Mr Poots said he was \"happy to consider any proposals put forward\" and called for a \"balanced approach to tackling climate change.\" He claimed he was finalising a discussion paper on a future climate change bill consultation and that it would be released in \"the next number of weeks.\" \"I have written to all of my Executive colleagues requesting that they highlight what steps they are taking in their departments to contribute to reducing Northern Ireland's carbon footprint,\" he said. \"I have also had discussions with the Environment Minister in the Republic of Ireland around this important issue to gather information on how they intend to tackle this issue. The minister said he had asked for advice from the UK Climate Change Committee on what Northern Ireland's contribution to the UK's 'net zero' 2050 emissions target should be. \"I want to consider this information to ensure our emissions reduction targets are credible and evidence based,\" he said.

Popular petitions have raised issues such as sick pay for the self-employed, pay rises for NHS workers and tuition fee refunds for students. Ms McKinnell said the number of online submissions was \"unprecedented\". In a letter to other committee chairs, she said the issues raised had fed into letters MPs had written to ministers on their handling of the pandemic. However she added it is not possible to schedule debates on petitions in Parliament because the normal venue, Westminster Hall, is closed. Normally petitions are considered for a debate in Parliament if they gain 100,000 names. Those with 10,000 signatures also receive a government response. Parliament's Petitions Committee website reopened in early March after closing down because of the general election in December last year. In the weeks afterwards, the pandemic has worsened in the UK and the government has introduced social distancing and curbs to normal life to slow the spread of the virus. The economic impact has led to a surge in applications for welfare benefits, while so far 2.8m have been put on the government's furlough scheme. The most popular online petition, with 696,682 signatures, calls on the government to extend statutory sick pay to people who are self-employed. A breakdown by parliamentary constituency reveals it was most likely to be signed by voters in the south of England, notably London, Bristol and Brighton. The two next most popular petitions, launched on 6 and 12 March, called for ministers to consider closing schools and implement a \"lockdown\" - both measures which have since been imposed in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. A petition calling for students affected by university closures to have tuition fees reimbursed has garnered 330,859 signatures - perhaps unsurprisingly, it received much greater levels of support in citie\n\nSummary:","375":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Mr Rowlands is standing for election in Cardiff South and Penarth in May. In a report seen by BBC Wales, the ombudsman said he had breached the local authority's code of conduct. It added his behaviour suggested \"a significant lack of judgement\". Neither Mr Rowlands nor Cardiff South and Penarth Conservative Association have responded to requests for comment. It is unclear if the association was aware of the investigation into Mr Rowlands when he was selected to stand. The initial report recommended no further action be taken against Mr Rowlands. However, BBC Wales understands an appeal against that decision has been made. Due to the way the Public Service Ombudsman's procedures work, the finding is effectively quashed pending the appeal. Mr Rowlands was a director of The Watering Hole caf\u00e9 and wine bar at the time it opened in June 2019. A complaint was filed to the ombudsman by Vale of Glamorgan council leader, Neil Moore, that Mr Rowlands had opened the premises, despite change of use planning permission not being in place. Mr Rowlands was at that time, and continues to be, a member of the council's planning committee. In its report, the ombudsman said: \"Councillor Rowlands said he found planning matters complicated and difficult to understand. \"Councillor Rowlands said his understanding was that\u2026 (planning permission) was a grey area, and he had not grasped that\u2026 (not having it) would be a breach of planning control.\" The report said the opening of The Watering Hole was \"subject to objections from residents and negative publicity in the press\". Mr Rowlands, who was mayor of Vale of Glamorgan council between 2018 and 2019, was also pictured wearing his mayoral chains on the website of the company which owned The Watering Hole. In his defence, Mr Rowlands said his relationship with his \n\nSummary:","376":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Herald previously made headlines when a sexually explicit phrase appeared in an advertisement. Publisher Tom Sinclair said there was no question of the paper closing. \"I had a very clear aim when I decided to start the newspaper which was that the Pembrokeshire Herald will be a paper that is a campaigning paper, a paper which has got a distinctive voice, and a paper that is not frightened to speak the truth and to tell the news no matter what,\" said Mr Sinclair, who is no relation to the paper's former editor. 'More successful' \"It was unfortunate that although Bruce Sinclair was a very good journalist, he wasn't the right person to take the Pembrokeshire Herald in the direction that we, the founders, wanted to take it in.\" He added: \"I don't think there's any question of if the paper will survive, I think it certainly will. I think the paper will be more successful if it is a paper which gives the real news and tells the real stories. \"The point is we've always said we want to be a newspaper and not a snooze-paper. \"It's all very well having the small little stories about raising money for the lifeboats and charity things - that's all important, of course - but we have to have investigative journalism, we have to be able to say what's going on in Pembrokeshire.\" In a statement, Bruce Sinclair said he had enjoyed being with the paper since its launch, but following the inclusion of the opinion piece - Badger Knows Best - against his wishes he had decided to part company with it. \"While I have certainly enjoyed the challenge of creating a new newspaper from scratch, a lack of editorial resources has made my role difficult,\" he said.

Last week, news of the deal angered Bayer investors, with one describing it as \"arrogant empire-building\". The offer marks the biggest ever bid by a German company, dwarfing the Daimler's $38.6bn acquisition of Chrysler in 1998. John Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, said it was an unusual approach for a German firm, which he said typically opted for lower risk expansion. \"The Bayer bid is clearly designed to leave the board of Monsanto with little room for manoeuvre. The large cash bid means - despite Monsanto's dislike of European ownership - they will appear as though self interest is prevailing if they reject it. \"Few megabids go well and research shows more than half destroy value, and only around a quarter deliver on their promises,\" he said. Bayer's farm business produces seeds as well as compounds to kill weeds, bugs and fungus, but it is better known for its healthcare products such as Asprin and Alka-Seltzer. Analysts said if the deal went through, almost half of the merged firms' business would be agriculture, a mix likely to displease investors who had bought shares in Bayer for its pharmaceutical offering. Bayer's shares, which fell 8% when the merger talks were announced last week, fell 3% in early trading. The offer comes amid a wave of mergers in the industry. 'Perfect match' Rivals Dow Chemical, DuPont and Syngenta have all announced tie-ups recently, although they have yet to be cleared by regulators. The drop in commodity prices has put pressure on firms such as Monsanto, with farmers' cutting orders for supplies.

The party has agreed to scrap the president's role, give members an equal vote, and set up a leader's team which it says will ensure clearer leadership.

The review, called Moving Forward and led by Plaid's economic policy adviser Eurfyl ap Gwilym, recognised the party's lack of electoral progress. It laid out structural and membership recommendations that will be reflected in the new constitution.

But it has cut the scheme for 2018\/19, as the cost of uniforms had \"reduced\". The Bevan Foundation said it was a \"mealy-mouthed\" justification for a cut that would save a small sum. Dr Victoria Winckler, the think tank's director, said the grant was \"not perfect\" but the decision to end it was a \"surprise\". \"It's quite a big expense, especially if you've got more than one child,\" she said. \"And that comes on top of an expensive school holiday period, where you've had to pay for extra meals, and perhaps for entertainment and so on. \"For families that are already on low incomes, it can be a real blow. \"It's no accident that pay day loan companies are very active around that time of year, the start of the school term.\" The scheme was introduced in 2005 with its latest incarnation offering eligible pupils \u00a3105 before they start secondary school in Year 7. The grant has been administrated by councils, with parents applying to their local authority for the money. Dr Winckler also called for low-cost uniforms to be available in supermarkets and other outlets, and to have sew-on badges. Staff at Ysgol Friars in Bangor, Gwynedd, already buy poorer pupils items such as shoes they cannot afford, according to headmaster Neil Foden. \"Children can be very cruel to those who are somehow different,\" the NUT Wales chairman told BBC Radio Wales. \"If they are obviously different and dressed differently, it does draw attention.\" He said the school was holding charity dress-down days but these have reduced, adding: \"Children from poor backgrounds simply can't compete in the fashion stakes with their wealthier peers.\" Mr Foden described the uniform as \"eliminating differences between pupils\" and said undermining it create divisions.

Chwayita Bam, 31, real estate agent: I'm in a new relationship now and one of the first things we spoke about is condoms. I told him straight, \"I don't know where you've been, you don't know where've I've been. I don't know your status so we have to use a condom.\" He wasn't too happy with the decision but he agreed. It becomes a bit awkward because at times in the heat of the moment we need to stop what we're doing to grab a condom and it interrupts the whole thing. We've spoken about getting tested for HIV together so we can stop using them but I've explained to him that because I'm not on any contraception - this is my only way of preventing pregnancy. I've been in a situation in the past where a guy wanted to have sex without a condom and we had a massive fight about it, he even became physical. He didn't understand why I wouldn't sleep with him without it. I was blunt. I told him, \"If you force yourself on me it will be rape.\" That scared him and he stopped. I didn't ever see him again. People say when you're having sex without a condom it's a lot nicer, I agree and I think that's why some people, including women, don't like them.

Hitherto, the Galapagos Islands have avoided a similar fate. But Dr Parker, who contributed towards a new report about avian malaria on the archipelago, believes it could be just a matter of time before the virus claims its first species. The disease is already prevalent in the yellow warbler and Galapagos penguin, which has an estimated population of just 3,000 individuals. The parasite that causes avian malaria (Plasmodium) requires passage through the digestive and circulatory systems of a biting insect in order to reproduce. \"The insect is considered the primary host of the parasite,\" explains Dr Parker. Suitable hosts However, for the Plasmodium parasite to complete its life-cycle it must then be transmitted to a suitable bird host through the saliva of the biting insect. \"The parasite then goes through a massive multiplication phase in the liver of the animal before entering the bloodstream,\" says Dr Parker. \"From there, the next biting insect that takes a blood meal picks them up.\" But not all birds are competent hosts. \"We are trying to identify which species of mosquito is responsible for vectoring it and which bird species is the reservoir for this parasite,\" says Dr Parker.

She was attending a meeting for people affected by the scandal Spaniards call \"ninos robados\" - stolen children. She has three daughters and lots of grandchildren, but she has never got over the loss of her first-born - a son - nearly 40 years ago. She had come to think she was crazy for believing he was alive, instead of dead and buried as hospital doctors had told her. \"Now,\" she said, gripping my hand tightly. \"Look around the room at the other women here. All like me. The same background. The same experience. I'm not mad and my family finally believes me.\" In 1971 Manoli, who was 23 at the time and not long married, gave birth to what she was told was a healthy baby boy, but he was immediately taken away for what were called routine tests. Nine interminable hours passed. \"Then, a nun, who was also a nurse, coldly informed me that my baby had died,\" she says. They would not let her have her son's body, nor would they tell her when the funeral would be.

Mr Caudwell, who sold Phones 4U to Providence Equity and Doughty Hanson for \u00a31.5bn in 2006, has called on the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to investigate the networks' actions. He suspects the companies may have colluded to remove Phones 4U from the high street in an attempt to reduce competition, but admits that he has no evidence. John Fingleton, former chief executive of the Office for Fair Trading, said: \"It doesn't look very pleasant, it looks very sudden and very abrupt. But that's a very different thing than alleging that the phone companies have got together to try and raise prices or to exclude somebody with the intention of raising prices. And I see no evidence for that.\" EE told the programme its decision to end its relationship with Phones 4U was based on its strategy to focus on its own shops and cut out intermediaries, while Vodafone rejected an suggestion that it had acted inappropriately during contract negotiations. An O2 spokesperson said: \"We informed Phones 4U of our decision to stop connecting new customers through our partnership back in 2012. \"We subsequently took the decision not to extend our contract beyond 31st January 2014.

Manager Mike Matthews said all 70 rooms will be available for people in need. Homeless charity Shelter said councils must provide safe accommodation to those in need during the new lockdown which starts on Thursday. Under government guidance hotels, hostels and other accommodation should only open for those who have to travel for work purposes, from Thursday. Mr Matthews said he has started a dialogue with Shropshire Council and will open the hotel doors to rough sleepers and vulnerable people from Wednesday. Fifty-seven people were housed at the Prince Rupert during the previous lockdown. One man has been hired as a chef and Mr Matthews had plans to hire another, but this has been postponed until after lockdown. Chris Bennett, who stayed at the hotel during the last lockdown after finding himself homeless after leaving hospital, has now been placed into council housing. Shropshire Council placed a full-time position in the hotel to help people out and the hotel continued to welcome paying-guests after the lockdown. Mr Matthews described it as \"an experiment\". \" \"I've puzzled why it hasn't been rolled out across the country,\" he said. \"These are totally unprecedented times.

In the referendum on 23 June the UK voted to leave the EU, with 51.9% in favour of leaving and 48.1% supporting Remain. Critics said that those protesting who lost the vote were \"having a tantrum\". Demonstrators gathered around Park Lane before setting off for Parliament Square. A rally also took place in York. An organiser of the London march, Keiran MacDermott, said protesters hoped to stop the government from triggering Article 50, which begins the formal process of the UK's withdrawal from the EU. Fellow organiser Mark Thomas, an activist, said he felt \"anger, frustration\" and a \"need to do something\". At the end of the two-mile route, protesters gathered in front of Parliament, and listened to speakers including Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, leftwing commentator and activist Owen Jones and musician Bob Geldof. Mr Geldof urged Remain campaigners to take to the streets, speak to their neighbours and work to stop the UK's exit from the EU. \"We need to individually organise ourselves.

Ministers want to reduce the number of councils from 22 to eight or nine. Council leaders said they had \"responded positively\" in seeking new ways of running services. Five years into the longest period of sustained spending reductions since World War Two, he said public services needed to be reformed, but that had been \"overshadowed\" by local government reorganisation. 'Longer term' The Welsh government's council merger plans have had a hostile reception from political opponents and some Labour council leaders. \"There has been a lot of debate about the nature of services, but it has been overshadowed by what kind of structure of local government we want,\" Mr Thomas said. \"What's more important for people is not necessarily what council is there, but the services they are providing, it's certainly been a distraction. \"It's affected, I think, the ability of some councils to think beyond four or five year horizons. They need to think much longer term.\" He said councils in England were \"redesigning themselves\" and \"we need to be doing the same in Wales\". \"But there's almost a desire to do as little change as is needed,\" Mr Thomas said. Cuts in Westminster have cost devolved services \u00a31.2bn in real terms (7%) since 2010 and that is predicted to rise to \u00a31.8bn (11%) by 2019-20. Yet demand for services from a growing and ageing population has continued to increase. In the latest in a series of reports assessing public services, Mr Thomas said there had been some improvements, for example in public health, the quality of NHS services and cancer survival rates. Education results have also got better, albeit from a low base in some areas. But waiting times, including for cancer treatment, emergency care and planned operations, have all got worse.

However, police said they had concerns about them tipping over at roundabouts or on tight turns. They also said the lack of doors meant any side-on impact would result in \"injury or worse\" to any occupants. A report to the local authority's licensing panel asks it to consider whether it is satisfied, in principle, that a tuk-tuk is suitable for use as a taxi or private hire. The tuk-tuk is a motorised version of the traditional pulled rickshaw or cycle rickshaw. They are popular in countries with tropical climates with the biggest manufacturer based in India. A request has now been received which could pave the way for their use in the cooler climes of south-west Scotland. It has prompted concerns from both council officers and police. Transport manager Gordon Bryce said he did not believe the vehicle was suited to the region's roads, as its top speed of about 40mph would make it an obstruction on trunk and B roads, increasing the risk of accidents. He said the lack of safety devices like air bags was his \"greatest concern\". He suggested it would be more appropriate to look at using electric tuk-tuk vehicles in a major town on agreed routes and within agreed times. Sgt Jonny Edgar, from Police Scotland, said negotiating the likes of the large A75\/A76 roundabout at any speed would make a three-wheeled vehicle liable to tip over. He also highlighted the small size of the vehicle as a concern. \"Coupled with no airbags or side impact protection, I fear death or serious injury is a very real possibility,\" he said. He added the lack of doors on the vehicle was also of particular concern if it was used by \"intoxicated patrons or children\". \"There are reports of intoxicated passengers falling from the rear of a tuk-tuk to their death,\" he said. \"Although seatbelts would be present it would be naive to believe that all passengers wear them.\"\n\nSummary:","393":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A spokeswoman said the tool was used to \"ensure public safety\" and was one of \"a number of detection and tracking methods\". The local council said it was unaware that the system was in place. It was first reported by the Financial Times. In a statement, developer Argent said it used cameras \"in the interest of public safety\" and likened the area to other public spaces. \"These cameras use a number of detection and tracking methods, including facial recognition, but also have sophisticated systems in place to protect the privacy of the general public,\" it said.

Reptile curator, Tim Skelton, said it was a 40-year \"career highlight\" as the species was very difficult to breed. The youngster, called Vernon, is being kept in a climate-controlled room and hand fed chopped worms by keepers. He currently weighs 28g and measures around 5cm (2in) long. 'Boggy tank' \"Not a lot is known about this species so we can learn an awful lot from this baby to improve our chances of breeding more in future,\" said Mr Skelton. \"These are secretive animals so we are keeping it in a warm, humid and quiet room with a constant temperature, in a boggy tank to replicate its natural habitat where it can burrow among the soil and leaves.\" As well as being a UK first, Bristol Zoo is also only the second in Europe to have bred the species, with success also having been seen at a zoo in Germany. The zoo is part of a European breeding programme with private turtle experts and now has a total of seven Vietnamese box turtles. Hunting for their meat, or medicinal use, or as pets, led to the species being listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

They added the real reason for the decision was because the prime minister took a \"personal interest\". Mrs Justice Andrews, who analysed arguments at a hearing on Skype in April, has dismissed the NFU challenge. The cull was set to go ahead in Derbyshire last winter in a bid to control bovine TB. But in September the government said it would not grant the county's farmers licenses to do it. NFU lawyers told Mrs Justice Andrews lobbying by Badger Trust chief executive Dominic Dyer included meeting Mr Johnson's partner, Carrie Symonds, in Downing Street. Sir James Eadie QC, from Environment Secretary George Eustice's legal team, said the idea that there was \"something sinister\" about Mr Johnson's involvement was \"unsustainable\". Farmers believe culling is necessary to control the disease that affects the beef and dairy industries, but opponents say it is inhumane and ineffective. In March, the government announced it would be phasing out culling in favour of vaccinations. Mrs Justice Andrews said, in a written ruling published on Wednesday, it was a \"difficult\" decision which involved the \"exercise of complex political and ethical value judgments\". She added the direction made against culling was not irrational. \"In short, however compelling the case for permitting the licence to be issued might appear, there were countervailing political considerations which legitimately led the responsible decision-maker to conclude that no licence should be granted in Derbyshire for that year,\" she said. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it welcomed the ruling. He said: \"The government remains committed to its strategy to combat bovine TB which leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers.\" Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

He said: \"Jonathan taught us how big a heart a person can have, and how it will guide how we live and what we do for a living.\" Demme's own Oscar was for best director for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992. The second film to feature serial killer Hannibal Lecter, it is one of only three films to win the so-called \"big five\" Oscars. As well as best director, the 1991 film was named best picture, won a screenplay prize and saw both of its lead actors honoured. Demme also steered Mary Steenburgen to a best supporting actress Oscar for his 1980 film Melvin and Howard. In recent years he worked with Anne Hathaway on Rachel Getting Married and directed Meryl Streep in both Ricki and the Flash and his 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate.

But China has been showing a very different face to countries closer to home in an increasingly tense confrontation over rival claims to the resource-rich waters of the South China Sea. It is a region where the peaceful nature of China's rise is starting to be questioned as it pushes a long-standing maritime claim that stretches deep into South East Asia. \"China is becoming much more confident in the region and there are signs it is becoming giddy with success. It has become much more influential much more quickly than it expected,\" says Dr Kerry Brown of the Asia Programme at Chatham House in London. Vietnam and the Philippines in recent months have seen the snarl of a resurgent regional power that is fast losing patience with the gripes of smaller neighbours over maritime borders. \"If these countries do not want to change their ways with China, they will need to prepare for the sound of cannons. It may be the only way for the dispute in the sea to be resolved,\" said the state run newspaper, the Global Times, in a recent editorial. Hard power Chinese officials have been more restrained in their comments, but foreign ministry spokesmen have issued a series of warnings about what they see as encroachments into Chinese waters.

The party had earlier won Battersea, Croydon Central and Enfield Southgate. The Liberal Democrats also had a resurgence in south west London with Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey both returning to parliament. The Tories have managed to win 21 seats. Labour's Emma Dent Coad's victory in Kensington was the final result to be returned in the 2017 General Election. She beat Tory incumbent Victoria Borwick, the city's former deputy mayor, who had a 7,000 majority in the 2015 election. Justine Greening was one of the Conservatives to be returned to Parliament, although her majority was vastly reduced from more than 10,000 to about 1,500. Zac Goldsmith won Richmond Park back from Lib Dem Sarah Olney with a majority of only 45. Labour was already dominant in London, having won 45 seats in 2015, compared with 27 for the Conservatives and one for the Lib Dems. Marsha De Cordova defeated former junior minister Jane Ellison in Battersea, while Tory housing minister Gavin Barwell lost his seat to Labour's Sarah Jones. Bambos Charalambous defeated David Burrowes in Enfield Southgate by 4,355 votes. Labour also won comfortable majorities in marginal seats such as Ealing Central and Acton, with Rupa Huq increasing her majority from 274 in 2015 to nearly 14,000. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who took over Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's former seat in Tooting, also increased her majority from 5.3% to 26.6%.

The firm said management layers would be reduced and simplified under a plan to be substantially completed by January next year. A BAT spokesperson declined to give any details of where the jobs would go. The company has its headquarters in London and has 55,000 employees worldwide, with 55 factories in 48 countries. BAT shares were up 2.5% in Thursday morning trading in London. \"With the focus on simplification and removal of management layers, it is expected that over 20% of the senior roles in the organisation will be affected,\" it said. New chief executive Jack Bowles, who has been in the role for five months, said he wanted to \"ensure a future fit culture\". \"My goal is to oversee a step change in 'new category' growth and significantly simplify our current ways of working and business processes, whilst delivering long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders.

Many Moldovans live in dire poverty. Mr Gaburici only became PM in February. \"The issue of my school diploma... will be removed from the agenda,\" he said, announcing his resignation on TV. Moldova, an ex-Soviet state, signed a far-reaching association agreement with the EU in 2014, angering Russia. Moldova, bordering on Ukraine, is one of Europe's poorest countries and has been plagued by political instability. The capital Chisinau saw angry demonstrations in May when news of the banking scandal broke. Pro-Russian separatists have run a breakaway region, Trans-Dniester, since a war with Moldova in the 1990s, and they have Russian backing. Mr Gaburici was appointed to head a minority coalition government, formed by two pro-EU parties. \"I would like the government to focus on the fight against corruption, depoliticisation of all institutions and on ensuring the security of the financial and banking sector,\" he said in his resignation address. On Monday prosecutors said they suspected that a signature and a stamp on two of his school documents had been forged. In May, an Israeli-born businessman, Ilan Shor, was placed under house arrest in connection with the $1bn that went missing from Unibank, Banca Sociala and Banca de Economii.

A question mark still remains over the long-term future of Belfast City Hospital's A&E unit which closed temporarily on 1 November last year. The Health and Social Care Board is due to discuss the issue on Thursday. When the City's A&E unit shut, it was reported that hospitals nearby would have to cope with an extra 40,000 patients attending their emergency departments. Reduction At a specially convened meeting of Belfast Health Trust on Tuesday, senior executives were given details about how the closure has been affecting Belfast's other two main hospitals over the past nine months. Dr Patricia Donnelly, the trust's director of acute services, produced figures showing that the number of people going to emergency departments at the Royal Victoria and the Mater hospitals had dropped by around 15%. She also confirmed that over the same period, there has been a 26% reduction in patient waiting times at both those emergency departments. Dr Donnelly said trust executives discussed three options which included having A&E services at all three main Belfast hospitals, retaining emergency units at the Royal and Mater and thirdly, concentrating A&E services at the Royal only. She explained the trust had looked at different criteria, including patient safety and quality of service before deciding to endorse the option of retaining A&E at the Mater and the Royal only.

Mr Smith is also expected to meet party leaders with T\u00e1naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney at 17:00 GMT on Thursday. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties split in a row. With no devolution, political parties have called on Mr Smith to intervene on health - but he has insisted it remains a matter for them. About 15,500 nurses in Northern Ireland staged a strike action on Wednesday in a dispute over pay and patient safety. It follows weeks of industrial action by other healthcare workers over the same issues. Major investment needed The secretary of state said he wanted to be as \"activist\" as possible in getting the executive restored, but insisted he has no powers to intervene directly on health. Asked if the British government would contribute funding towards health if the parties could reach consensus, Mr Smith said he was \"expecting a number of financial requests\" from the parties.

Many were killed or captured and enslaved. Yazidis follow an ancient faith that jihadists regard as devil worship. The report, commissioned by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was based on more than 100 interviews with survivors of attacks in Iraq between June 2014 and February this year. Among the atrocities it says were perpetrated against the Yazidi community by IS (also known as ISIL), were: The reports adds: \"In some instances, villages were entirely emptied of their Yazidi population.\" A statement by the OHCHR says: \"One witness described how two ISIL members sat laughing as two teenage girls were raped in the next room. \"A pregnant woman, repeatedly raped by an ISIL 'doctor' over a period of two-and-a-half months, said he deliberately sat on her stomach. \"He told her: 'This baby should die because it is an infidel; I can make a Muslim baby'. \" The plight of the Yazidi population was brought to international attention when IS captured the town of Sinjar in August 2014. Thousands of residents, mainly Yazidis, were forced to flee. Many were trapped on nearby Mount Sinjar, which was surrounded by IS fighters. Airstrikes led by the Unites States, and an offensive led by Kurdish peshmerga forces, helped break the stranglehold on Mount Sinjar. Who are the Yazidis? Who, What, Why: Who are the Yazidis?

'Second-class status' More than 4,500 women are currently being held in prisons across Iraq, according to the 105-page report, titled \"No One is Safe\" - The Abuse of Women in Iraq's Criminal Justice System. A vast majority of them are Sunni Muslims, but the abuses documented by HRW showed \"women of all sects and classes\" were affected. Many of those interviewed described being \"beaten, kicked, slapped, hung upside-down and beaten on their feet, given electric shocks, and raped or threatened with sexual assault by security forces during their interrogation\". Sexual violence was so commonplace that one employee at a women's prison facility was quoted as saying: \"We expect that they've been raped by police on the way to the prison.\" Contrary to Iraqi law, most of the female detainees had no access to a lawyer before or during their interrogations, the study found. \"Iraqi security forces and officials act as if brutally abusing women will make the country safer,\" said Joe Stork, HRW's deputy Middle East and North Africa director. \"Both men and women suffer from the severe flaws of the criminal justice system.

Many people have cover for blocked drains as part of their home insurance. However, sometimes a CMC will offer to handle the claim for them, charging a significant sum. Direct Line says some people end up paying thousands of pounds to such companies when they could contact their insurance company for free. The firm says there has been a sharp rise in the number of claims being made for blocked drains. In the first quarter of 2017, it estimates the number increased by 22% compared to 2016, with no apparent or logical explanation. Hefty cost It's thought that in some cases, unscrupulous drainage firms are selling details of their clients to CMCs. Those CMCs then approach the householder and ask them to sign a bit of paper, typically promising to give the management company 10% of the eventual insurance payout. Direct Line says that in some cases, people can also be confused about whether they are dealing with a drain repair company or a CMC. \"It is important that vulnerable customers who have an issue with their property are not taken advantage of by companies that are looking to profit from their misfortune,\" said Katie Lomas, director of Direct Line Home Insurance. \"Fraudulent and inflated claims drive up the cost of policies for all consumers. Anyone that thinks they may need to make a claim on their insurance policy should contact their provider directly.\" As part of its research, Direct Line examined more than 2,000 drainage claims made in the last year.

Officers searching his luxury ranch seized 17 paintings believed to be by famous artists such as Joan Miro, Fernando Botero and Leonora Carrington. Police continue to search for Mr Duarte, who has been charged with organised crime and money laundering. Mr Duarte denied the accusations made against him before his disappearance but has not spoken out since. Veracruz Governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares, who took over as governor last week, said the works of art seized on Sunday would be auctioned off. The proceeds would be used to finance a children's hospital, he said. Luxury retreat Mr Yunes alleged that the property had been furnished using money siphoned off from public funds. \"More than 200m pesos ($9.7m; \u00a37.6m) stolen from the people of Veracruz were spent doing up this house so that Duarte could have people over, now he won't host anything any more,\" he said. Officials said the paintings would still have to be verified by experts but they believe they are dealing with works by Mexican painters David Alfaro Siqueiros and Rufino Tamayo, Spanish artist Joan Miro and English-born Mexican painter Leonora Carrington. Officers also found a sculpture by Mexican artist Javier Marin and copies of historic documents such as Mexico's Declaration of Independence. They said the combined value of the works of art seized would still have to be determined. They had been stored in a cellar in Mr Duarte's weekend retreat. The ranch has 25 rooms, a helicopter landing pad, two tennis courts and extensive grounds just outside the city of Cordoba, in north-eastern Veracruz.\n\nSummary:","409":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Care Forum Wales also said there were still problems with the number of false positive and inconclusive results. A minister said the time during the Welsh lockdown was being used to boost testing in care homes. Gaynor Jones, of Orchard Care Group which runs two homes in Wrexham, said they tested staff on a Wednesday - and receive the results four days later on a Sunday. \"You hold your breath to see if any of your staff test positive. If there was a large amount of positive results, what would we do? Who looks after the residents? We haven't got a massive pool of staff.\" There have also been issues with couriers not arriving on time to pick up swabs to take for testing. She said on one occasion she did not receive any results at all and was told \"there was a backlog in the labs\". \"The whole thing is a mess to be honest... we are doing our best and we have contingency plans in place should we be unfortunate enough to get a positive test. \"It makes you very fearful. \"We're doing all we can to keep Covid out, we're testing staff temperatures when they arrive and staff don't travel in uniform.\" Staff at the company's Bay Tree and Cherry Tree care homes moved in for six weeks during the first lockdown to avoid transmitting Covid-19. A recent survey by Care Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 care homes, nursing homes and other independent health and social care providers showed 29% of homes had experienced false positive results, while 28% had waited for at least one result for seven days.

Not yet - and the privacy-conscious way in which they are designed could mean we will never know how effective they have been. Last month, the UK government announced that it was abandoning a centralised NHS contact-tracing app for England and switching to a decentralised version, based on the Apple-Google toolkit. This model has been favoured by privacy campaigners because the matching process takes place on users' smartphones rather on a central computer, providing a greater degree of anonymity. But the government stressed that the new version would not arrive in a hurry, and Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that no country in the world had a functioning contact-tracing app. The Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Keir Starmer, immediately pointed to Germany, as did many others who disputed the prime minister's claim. Germany's Corona-Warn-App was rolled out nationwide in June. A few days ago, the Robert Koch Institute provided an update on its progress, celebrating the fact that it had now been installed by around 16 million people. \"A successful start that speaks for great interest and acceptance among the population,\" a statement from the app's developer said. Bear in mind, however, that there are 83 million Germans, and it is thought more than half of the population need to have an app before it is truly effective. \"The app works\" added the institute's president Prof Lothar Wieler. He went on to say that about 500 app users had tested positive for the virus and \"had the opportunity to warn others via the app\".

The report calls for more flexibility in the workplace for carers. The charity's head, Helen Walker, says that 15% of the working population is \"now working and caring\". The report estimates that almost five million people are trying to balance looking after relatives with working - up from about three million in 2011. An ageing population has pushed this increase - but the report says not enough employers are offering flexibility over working hours or taking leave. 'Not a penny to spare' Carers UK is calling for employment rights to formally recognise the needs of carers, such as providing five to 10 days per year of paid leave. Such carers in work are typically aged over 45 and the report says that their caring responsibilities \"often go unnoticed\". Among those giving up their job is Terry, who has left his role as a duty hospital manager in London to move to Monmouth to look after his father. The 92-year-old was living alone after Terry's mother died and he had begun to \"struggle with everyday tasks\". For Terry, it has meant going from a well paid job to relying on a carer's allowance and accepting that he now \"doesn't have a penny spare\". The report follows a warning from the Office for National Statistics of growing numbers of people who not only have to look after an elderly relative but are also caring for their children. There are 1.3 million of these mid-life \"sandwich carers\", says the ONS, with many feeling ignored and undervalued. More than a quarter of such carers are suffering from depression or stress, says the ONS. Carers UK says there is a \"real social and economic imperative\" for workplaces to be made \"carer friendly\". \"Better workplace support for people juggling paid work with caring for a loved one is becoming an incr\n\nSummary:","412":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But, as one senior minister suggested tonight, for the rebels ranged against Boris Johnson next week, being angry about the time they have at hand isn't going to achieve their goals. \"The thing for them is not to be outraged, it's to change the law.\" Within days we will know if the MPs who are implacably opposed to leaving the EU without a deal can really do that. With lots of former ministers on the backbenches, the group which is openly fighting against the possibility of leaving the EU without a deal has a different complexion. And the opposition parties, including the Labour leadership, now appear fully engaged in next week's plan. This is a big, powerful and diverse group, rather than a handful of experienced backbenchers doing their best to get huge numbers of MPs on side. The strange political rainbow that is the loose rebel alliance now ranges from Conservatives like Philip Hammond at one end, all the way through to Jeremy Corbyn on the other - from dark blue to dark red, taking in yellow, green and all sorts of other shades in the middle. Brexit continues to do weird things to the shape of our politics. They are united in a determination to make it impossible for the prime minister ever to take us out of the EU if he hasn't been able to agree a new deal with the EU, or get one that's approved by Parliament. It's a broadly held fear that leaving without formal arrangements in place could cause havoc - politically, and for the economy. But given Boris Johnson's main reason for success in the Tory leadership election was to leave the EU whatever it takes at the end of October, it is a pretty major goal for a group of backbenchers and opposition politicians.

Syria's army controls access to Rukban, which is near a US-backed rebels' base. Jordan is also blocking aid supplies. There have been reports of children dying due to poor sanitary conditions and a lack of healthcare at the camp. A cluster of about 10,800 makeshift tents and mud huts, the camp has been called \"one of the most desperate places in Syria\". The UN estimates that 80% of the people stranded at Rukban are women and children, while aid groups say that pregnant women at the camp have given birth without basic medical care. The aid convoy, operated jointly by the UN and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, arrived on Saturday. \"Seventy-eight trucks are delivering 10,475 food parcels and flour bags, clothes for 18,000 children, 10,075 hygiene kits and plastic sheets, [and] newborn baby kits for 1,200 children,\" the Syrian Arab Red Crescent said in a statement. The delivery is expected to take three to four days. \"We are also conducting an emergency vaccination campaign to protect some 10,000 children against measles, polio and other deadly diseases,\" UN humanitarian co-ordinator Ali Al-Za'tari said. The UN added that the overall humanitarian situation at the camp remained \"at a critical stage, with reported shortages of basic commodities... and the death of several children who reportedly were unable to get further medical treatment.\" Those at the camp began arriving in late 2015 after fleeing areas of Syria previously controlled by the militant Islamic State (IS) group. They wanted to cross into Jordan, which has taken in 670,000 Syrian refugees since the civil war began in 2011, but the kingdom sealed the crossing near Rukban in June 2016 after six soldiers were killed in a bomb attack claimed by IS.

Only one in three attempts at IVF results in a baby as abnormalities in an embryo's DNA are common. Large trials are now needed to see how effective the method is, experts say. If there are abnormalities with the packages of DNA, called chromosomes, in the embryo then it will not implant in the womb or if it does the foetus will not reach term. It is a problem which increases rapidly with age. One quarter of embryos are abnormal in a woman's early 30s, but this soars to three quarters by the time a woman reaches her late 30s and early 40s. Some clinics already offer a form of chromosome screening, but it can add between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 to the cost of IVF in the UK. Connor's mother, Marybeth Scheidts, said it would have cost her $6,000 (\u00a34,100) for the test in Pennsylvania. The new test takes advantage of the dramatic advances in sequencing the human genome. Within 24 hours it can ensure the correct number of chromosomes are present. Dr Dagan Wells from Oxford University told the BBC: \"Current tests are adding a significant amount of money on to an already expensive procedure and that is limiting access; most patients are having to pay for this out of pocket themselves. \"What our technique does is it gives you the number of chromosomes and other biological information about the embryo at a low cost - probably about two thirds of the price of existing methods of screening.\" He says trials are now needed to see if it could improve IVF success rates. Tears of joy The baby and a further pregnancy resulting from the screening method will be announced at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference. Marybeth Scheidts, 36, and her husband David Levy, 41, had been trying to conceive naturally for four years and also tried artificial insemination.

East Kent Against Fracking is concerned the drilling will cause light, noise and traffic pollution and could lead to hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\". A fracking expert said methane drilling was different to shale gas exploration. Julie Wassmer, vice chair of East Kent Against Fracking, said that the petition, which started on Wednesday had already gathered a lot of support. 'Shallower wells' She added: \"In spite of what happens below the ground with fracking, above the ground certainly what will happen with an exploratory well site is there could be potentially hundreds of such wells in a single well field. \"Residents in those sites will experience high levels of noise and light pollution from floodlights. \"There will be many heavy goods vehicles going to and from the site, risk of spillage of toxic fluids, local road damage and there could also be flaring of methane gas.\" Parish councils are holding meetings this week to discuss the plans, which are only for exploration, and have been submitted to Kent County Council. The authority said residents had until 15 November to make comments about the applications. Dr Chris Green from Gfrac, a hydraulic fracture consultancy firm, said drilling for methane gas was different to exploring for shale gas, which is what provoked protests in Balcombe in East Sussex. Sand and chemicals He said it used lower pressures and the wells are shallower. He added: \"It depends on the coal and that is what we need to figure out, what kind of coal bed we have. \"It may not be necessary to fracture and in which case it is just a case of pulling off the water for a period of time and then it starts to produce its own gas.\" Hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\" is a process by which sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well.

Under the plan, Nationwide is closing three offices in Swindon, with 3,000 staff either moving to the nearby HQ, working from home, or mixing the two. Other UK staff may be able to work from their local High Street branch if they prefer, rather than travel to offices. In a Nationwide survey of staff, 57% said they wanted to work from home full-time after lockdown ends. More than a third - 36% - said they preferred a mix of home and office-based work. Joe Garner, chief executive of Nationwide, said: \"The last year has taught many of us that 'how' we do our jobs is much more important than 'where' we do them from. \"We are putting our employees in control of where they work from, inviting them to 'locate for their day' depending on what they need to achieve.\" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Garner said that research suggested staff made better decisions when working from home. \"A third of our people are saying they have an even greater consideration of the human impact of their decisions,\" he said. \"And perhaps that's not surprising because people are in their home environment, they're seeing other people's children on the screen - [as well as] cats, dogs, etc.\" Nevertheless, he said the office would still play an important role, but people would not be told how often they have to travel into work. \"People do want to go,\" he said. \"They just don't want to be compelled to go every day.\" The move towards flexible working will see a change to the configuration of offices, with more collaboration spaces and fewer meeting rooms, as well as introducing quiet areas and designated walking and cycling routes.

Taxi drivers, pubs workers and hotels staff have already been given advice in how to spot the signs of grooming. Telford & Wrekin Council agreed to launch an independent inquiry, after the claims the town has endured a persistent problem with abuse, and set aside \u00a3350,000 to pay for it. As well as child sexual exploitation, refuse collectors will also be trained to spot and report modern day slavery and drug use. Sgt Ram Aston, from West Mercia Police, which is running the training with the council, said: \"They might see a young person that is walking through an estate on their own that might just prick their conscience and think: 'I see that person every morning, why are they not in bed? Why are they out so early? They've not got a paper round bag.'\" Tim Walters, from Veolia, which run's Telford's refuse collections, said: \"It is a question of getting the right message across for the bin men so they can help the communities they serve.\" One survivor, who was abused in the 1980s, told the BBC she thinks the training is a good thing, as long as police act quickly on information they receive.

The Keogh Review found the trust, which runs Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, had major failings. Maternity safety It was criticised for poor communication with patients, poor management of deteriorating patients, inappropriate referrals, delayed discharges and long waits in A&E. The hospital was later told by the Care Quality Commission it must take urgent action to improve safety on a maternity unit. In November health regulator Monitor said the hospital's problems were broader than first thought and said it must take urgent action or face leadership changes. The trust said in a statement Ms Harker and Mr Devlin had decided to hand over leadership of the trust to a new team. \"I would like to thank Mark and Denise for their dedication and integrity,\" said Colin Wilby, its senior independent director. \"Their commitment to public service is indisputable and we wish them both every success in the future.\" Earlier this week it was announced Medway Maritime's A&E department would undergo a \u00a35m redevelopment.

Jesus is a member of the now defunct Ninos Ricos (Rich Kids) gang in the Panamanian port city of Colon. A year ago, the Rich Kids heard about an amnesty which newly elected President Juan Carlos Varela was offering gang members willing to join a re-socialisation programme called Safer Neighbourhoods. Carrot and stick The president's offer followed the classical carrot-and-stick approach: incentives for those willing to sign up to the three-year programme and the threat of long prison terms for the rest. The Rich Kids had already been hit hard by a police crackdown, and with 38 of the 65-strong gang in jail, the remaining 27 sat down to discuss their options. Jesus had joined the gang at the age of 14. He insists he never killed anyone, but admits to taking part in shoot-outs with rival gangs. Since many of the gang members were fathers of young children and afraid of long jail terms, they made a unanimous decision to take up the president's offer. In a local evangelical church, they now attend daily classes teaching them basic values and life skills. But just months into the programme, they were faced with the hardest test yet for their resolve to change. 'No revenge' It came one Sunday morning as they were leaving church and about to set up a makeshift goal in the street for a game of football. Rival gang members drove up in a car and fired at them, killing one of their group. But instead of reacting to the assault as they would have done in the days before the programme, they just \"sat still and did nothing to avenge\" the murder of their friend. The programme tries to teach former gang members not just how to change their behaviour but also how to make a valuable contribution to society.

Sony also confirmed the PS5's \"digital edition\" - which does not have a disc drive - would cost about 40% more than the low-end Xbox Series S. Both PS5 consoles are set to be released on 19 November in the UK, and 12 November in the US, Japan and Australia. That puts them slightly later than Microsoft's 10 November launch date. Sony was the clear leader in the previous generation of the so-called console wars. The various PlayStation 4 consoles outsold the Xbox One range by a factor of more than two to one. But the \u00a3449\/$500\/\u20ac500 cost of the Japanese firm's new top-end machine and \u00a3360\/$400\/\u20ac400 price of the digital edition means it may be a closer battle this time, at least to begin with. Some industry-watchers believe Microsoft's combination of a \u00a3250 price for the XBox Series S and the value offered by the Xbox Game Pass subscription service could give the US firm an advantage. Microsoft offers members its first-party blockbuster games at launch in its games library, unlike Sony's existing PlayStation Now services, which is limited to older major releases. Sony's decision to price some of its first PS5 releases at \u00a370 - including the \"ultimate edition\" of a new Spider-Man game, and Demon's Souls - represents a rise, and will also have to be taken into consideration. It showed off a new subscription service called the PlayStation Plus Collection for the PS5.

In its annual assessment, the IMF also forecast France's economy would contract slightly more than forecast. It said GDP would fall 0.2% this year. ``We see deep structural issues affecting growth potential in France due to loss of competitiveness,'' said Edward Gardner, the chief of the IMF's mission to France. Shrinking economy The IMF expects the French economy to shrink 0.2% this year, down from a previous estimate of 0.1%. It predicts economic growth of 0.8% in 2014, just below its previous prediction of 0.9% growth. Mr Gardner praised two recent reforms in France: a tax credit that reduces payroll taxes for companies paying low salaries and a change to employment law aimed at reducing the cost of firing staff.

The aim is to deter the dirtiest vehicles in an effort to reduce diseases and premature deaths. The initiative comes as scientists say the impacts of air pollution are more serious than previously thought. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC the threat of air pollution, which is mostly invisible to the naked eye, was \"a public health emergency\". He added: \"One of the things that has troubled me is that because we can't see the particulate matter, the nitrogen dioxide, the poison, you don't take it seriously.\" But over the last few decades, research has revealed how gases like nitrogen dioxide and tiny particles, known as particulate matter or PM, can reach deep into the body with the danger of causing lasting damage. How polluting are idling cars and buses? Wood burners under fire in clean air plan Asthma attack The most obvious effects are on our breathing - anyone suffering from asthma, for example, is more likely to be at risk, because dirty air can cause chronic problems and also trigger an attack. \"I had to stay up one night because my chest was really bad because [of] all the polluted air,\" 10-year-old Alfie told me. \"I couldn't go to sleep and my mum had to stay awake.\" \"All that polluted air can hurt your lungs, it can even damage you brain, it can damage nearly everything in your body,\" he said. A pupil at Haimo Primary School in Eltham, close to London's busy South Circular Road, Alfie is one of 300 children across the capital taking part in unique research. The project involves each child wearing an air-monitoring backpack, specially built by Dyson and fitted with instruments to measure nitrogen dioxide and the smallest particles, called PM2.5. One motivation for the work is that breathing in dirty air at an early age can have implications that last a lifetime.

You may well wonder - as did I - why the paper was launched a week after the prime minister ruled out staying in the single market, and after the Scottish government's version had been discussed in Whitehall. Was the Welsh Government late with its homework? First Minister Carwyn Jones told me: \"Bear in mind as well that this document is supported by three parties in the assembly. This is not a document that is produced by one party or one government and we want to make sure that we have the widest buy-in possible to make sure we had the support that is needed.\" 'Norway' Both Mr Jones and Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, standing alongside one another said they respected last June's referendum result. But both maintain the prime minister is wrong to conclude that the logical consequence of the vote means leaving the single market. Carwyn Jones's approach was heavily influenced by his recent visit to Norway, which is part of the single market but is not in the EU. He suggested that freedom of movement rules could require EU migrants to have a job offer before moving here. His said UK legislation needed to be enforced to prevent workers' being exploited. Asked what message he would give to a Bridgend plumber concerned that his job could go to a Pole, who would do it for less, the first minister said: \"It's quite simple. You have to make sure people are prosecuted when they breach the law.\" Leanne Wood told the briefing: \"We do not accept that freedom of movement is a problem.\" She said that the number of EU migrants in Wales was small - 79,000, all of whom could fit in the Principality Stadium.

Much of the decrease has been put down to an increase in the cost of learning and then running a car. Some of the prices have risen slightly. Some, like car insurance, have rocketed. Twenty-year-old Chris started driving lessons a few years ago but had to stop because he couldn't afford it. He said: \"I don't have the money to spend on driving lessons so it's quite difficult because it means I have to rely on public transport such as the buses or getting lifts from my parents.\" Cost of learning Living in rural Suffolk, it can be a long wait for a bus. Chris can only work in his nearest town between 10.30am and 4.30pm because they're the times of the buses. His last bus home is at 4.55pm. \"If I miss that last bus then there's no way of me getting home,\" he said. \"I have to rely on my parents to pick me up which they don't normally like.\" According to a recent government survey, almost two thirds of young people who can't drive said they were put off by the cost of learning. It's not just down to the cost of lessons and driving test, both of which have increased. There's also the rise in taxing your car, filling it up with petrol and the biggest rise for young people - the cost of car insurance. Five years ago a 35-year-old would have paid around \u00a3245 for car insurance. That's risen to \u00a3325. A 17-year-old would have paid around \u00a32,500. That's now at least \u00a34,000, significantly more if you're male. EU legislation Insurance companies say that's because a young male driver is 10 times more likely to have an accident then someone over 35. Simon Douglas from the AA says having fewer young drivers on the road isn't necessarily a good thing. He said: \"It doesn't matter what age you learn to drive, the longer you spend behind the wheel the better you'll be as a driver.\" There are signs the c\n\nSummary:","428":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But a report to Norfolk County Council claimed cancelling the project could cost \u00a3100m in penalties. The council voted 40 to 38 accept the proposals for the incinerator after they were backed by officers in a report. The report by the council's director of environment, Mike Jackson, and the interim head of finance, Peter Timmins, says the burner could still save money. The incinerator has been opposed by local councils, MPs and tens of thousands of people in west Norfolk. 'Argued for years' George Nobbs, Labour leader of Norfolk County Council, said he was relieved at the outcome of the vote. \"I hope and pray that this is an end to the matter because people have argued for years that the council have never had a full debate about it,\" he said. \"We have achieved that today. We've had a totally free vote in every political party, as far as I know. I don't think there's any doubt about the result.\" He said the vote had not been about the rights and wrongs of the incinerator itself. \"The issue was whether or not to walk away from a contract and all the consequences of that - finding \u00a330m in 35 days - and I think they made the right decision,\" he said. The council's cabinet is expected to approve the decision at its meeting on Tuesday.

Northern Ireland, which will enter a new lockdown on 26 December, has \"never been in such a bad position\", with the health service in danger of being \"completely crushed\", according to Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. Some 38 million people in England will be subject to the nation's strictest measures from midnight. Wales had already announced a lockdown from 28 December, while Scottish leaders are warning they cannot rule out a similar move. 2. Lockdown restrictions hit retail sales Store closures enforced by Covid restrictions pushed down UK retail sales by 3.8% in November, ending a six-month streak of rising trade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest. Clothing store sales saw a sharp fall in volumes when compared with the previous month, the ONS says, while business feedback suggests consumers have brought forward Christmas spending. 3. Patients to get 'long Covid' checks at six weeks Patients in hospital with coronavirus should be offered a follow-up six weeks later to check for \"long Covid\" symptoms, says the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which issues guidance to the NHS.

The man in his late 20s reportedly said he was a former gymnast. South Korea's military announced it would now check every sensor at the inter-Korean border. The system was installed in 2015 and is supposed to alert guards if there is some impact on the fence. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff on Thursday said that because of loose screws, sensors had not worked properly. The gymnast defector was later picked up by surveillance cameras. There has been strong criticism over the issue in the South as it's seen as a failure to respond to a potential North Korean infiltration. After the defector had been tracked down, an inspection of the fence showed it had been pressed down - which should have in turn triggered the sensors, had they been working. According to South Korean media, authorities also had the young North Korean jump several times to verify his story of how he crossed the border.

It follows Wednesday's report by Lancashire County Council planners recommending refusal because of noise and traffic problems. Cuadrilla said it needed time to apply measures to address concerns. The firm said in a statement: \"Lessening any potential impact of our proposed operations on local residents is important to us.\" It said it would apply a further sound barrier around the major parts of the drilling rigs to reduce night-time noise levels. The company also said it had \"agreed in principle\" with Ministry of Defence for all HGV site traffic to go through the RAF Inskip site rather than through the villages of Wharles and Roseacre. The county council's development control committee was due to consider the application in two two-day hearings.

Lamington Viaduct - which crosses the River Clyde in South Lanarkshire - was damaged by severe storms in late 2015. Network Rail allowed several trains to use the crossing before it was closed for major repairs to its foundations. The bridge carries trains travelling between Carlisle and Glasgow. The government-owned company, that is responsible for Britain's rail infrastructure, was prosecuted following an investigation by the ORR - the rail regulator. A report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch published in November 2016 outlined major flaws in Network Rail's bridge-monitoring and safety assessment programme. It found that floodwater had scoured out much of the foundations of the second pier during Storm Frank on New Year's Eve 2015. HM Chief Inspector of Railways Ian Prosser welcomed the result of the court case. \"Our investigation revealed that Network Rail staff were unaware that they held safety critical duties under Network Rail's processes to manage infrastructure during extreme weather,\" he said. \"The viaduct was on Network Rail's list of high risk structures vulnerable to being washed away by moving water, yet despite this being a known issue, severe damage went unrecognised because Network Rail failed to implement its own procedures which would have meant no passenger trains should have passed over the viaduct. \"This verdict should be a reminder to Network Rail, as it progresses plans led by its two new task forces, that it must continue to acknowledge and act to guard against the serious impact of severe weather on infrastructure.\" In August, Network Rail launched task forces to consider the impact of heavy rainfall on the railway and the management of cuttings and embankments.

The bird's feathers are \"remarkably preserved\", including the chemical that gave them sparkle. The animal belongs to a group of early birds known as enantiornithines, which lived during the Age of the Dinosaurs. All known specimens come from rocks in Liaoning, China, which have yielded numerous fossils of feathered dinosaurs, primitive birds and pterosaurs. \"Many enantiornithine birds possessed ornate feathers,\" said lead researcher Dr Jennifer Peteya of the University of Akron, Ohio, US. \"This new specimen shows that some enantiornithines also had iridescent feathers and unlike most modern birds, these flashy ornaments developed before the animal was fully grown.\" Prehistoric plumage Scientists have limited knowledge of the plumage of birds from the time of the dinosaurs. Melanosomes can be seen in the fossil - microscopic structures that give rise to a broad range of colours in modern birds. They also produce iridescent effects, according to the way they reflect light. This is the first time evidence for iridescence has been found in enantiornithines, said Dr Stig Walsh, senior curator of vertebrate palaeobiology at National Museums Scotland. The colouration is used by birds today mostly for sexual selection. \"Although this particular individual was a very young adult, its tail feathers were already long and formed a kind of streamer,\" said Dr Walsh, who is not connected with the research. \"Again, this kind of extravagant feather array, like the tail feathers of peacocks, is usually used for mate attraction. \"It seems this bird was an adolescent out on its first attempt to 'pull', so to speak.\" The research is published in the journal Palaeontology.

The chancellor said the plan could cost up to \u00a37bn - but could be cheaper if existing rail lines were updated. Labour said \"nobody\" believed the Tories could deliver jobs in the north. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme - before a speech in Manchester - that the cities in the North of England were individually strong but were \"collectively not strong enough\". He said that in the past few decades giant global cities, such as London, had emerged - and that the string of northern cities, with better transport links and careful planning, could take them on and be \"greater than the sum of their parts\". Mr Osborne said the building of the east-west link should be considered as part of a review into the second phase of the \u00a350bn HS2 high-speed rail project. The current plan for the first phase of the project between London and Birmingham has proved controversial. Some residents are set to be disrupted and there is criticism of its price tag. The government's preferred route for the second phase involves extensions linking Birmingham with Manchester and Leeds - with the final route expected to be chosen by the end of this year. Mr Osborne said in his speech that it was not \"healthy for our economy, not good for our country\" if \"the powerhouse of London dominates more and more\". Along with improving roads - the M62 already links Liverpool on the west coast with Hull on the east coast, via Manchester and Leeds - Mr Osborne says a new high-speed rail link should be considered, based on the existing rail route but with new tunnels and infrastructure.

Protestors say the field by the M1 fulfils the legal criteria to be designated a village green, including proof it has been used unhindered by residents for 20 years. The council is expected to put the request to a public inquiry. Plans to build on the land at Ickley Close, which was given to the council by developers George Wimpey in the 1970s for residents, were approved by the council in July. The development includes more than 50 dwellings with 23 earmarked for social housing and shared ownership. Resident Stephanie Stiff, who has lived next to the field for 27 years, said Luton was already \"very depleted\" in open space. \"We know we need housing, it's desperate but there are brown field sites in Luton for them to build on,\" she said. \"Our open spaces are so important for the children, it's no good having houses everywhere and nowhere for people to breathe.\" She revealed that designating it a village green would give it \"an awful lot more protection\". \"Luton Borough Council will find it incredibly difficult to build on,\" she said. To be designated a village green, the land has to comply with section 15 of the Commons Act 2006, which states that \"a significant number of the inhabitants of any locality .... have indulged as of right in lawful sports and pastimes on the land for a period of at least 20 years\". Ms Stiff said that the land \"fulfilled the criteria\". \"We have signed legal statements from people saying what they have used the land for and for how long they have used it going back to before 1970,\" she said.

An ageing population, not enough of the right skills for future employment, and also lack of connectivity - both digitally and in transport. The next two months are crucial.

The Department for Transport (DfT) says there is no evidence older drivers are more likely to cause an accident, and it has no plans to restrict licensing or mandate extra training on the basis of age. There were 10,974 accidents involving drivers over the age of 70 in 2011, says the DfT. That compares with 11,946 accidents involving 17-to-19-year-old drivers and 24,007 accidents involving 20-to-24-year-old drivers. Its statistics do not account for who caused the accident. Figures also show that 46 drivers aged 16 to 19 died in an accident, while 173 drivers aged between 20 and 29 involved in an accident died. That compared with 59 deaths in drivers aged between 70 and 79 involved in an accident, and 52 over the age of 80. The young-versus-old driver data is used by a number of road safety charities to argue elderly drivers don't pose the greatest danger behind the wheel. \"There's a stat that young drivers under the age of 24 have twice as many crashes as you'd expect, given the numbers on the road, and older drivers have half as many as you'd expect, given the number on the road,\" says Neil Greig, director of policy and research at the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM). Research by the RAC Foundation suggests drivers aged 75 and over make up 6% of all licence holders but account for just 4.3% of all deaths and serious injuries. By contrast, drivers aged 16-20 make up just 2.5% of all drivers but 13% of those killed and seriously injured. But although both charities believe older drivers ar\n\nSummary:","444":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

This could be the outcome if proposed changes by NHS England are given the go-ahead. The proposals would curb the prescription of items such as silk garments for eczema sufferers, needs for some insulin pens for diabetics, and Amiodarone to treat abnormal heart rhythms. 'Life-saver' Jasper is three years old and has eczema. Besides using special creams, he also wears silk vests, leggings and gloves. As well as providing comfort for the little boy, the silks control the scratching which can cause bleeding and secondary infection. Even though some of the items have to be ordered via the family doctor, they still come under the 'low-priority' NHS prescription list. Jasper's mum Amanda says the silk clothing isn't a luxury, it's a \"life saver\" for her son. The family have a low income and would find it impossible to afford if the NHS prescription was removed. Dr David Hodges' son is aged six and also has eczema. Like Jasper, he wears silk garments which his father says have made a massive difference in the treatment of the condition. A GP in Stockton-on-Tees, Dr Hodges sees both sides of the debate - as a doctor and parent. He says the NHS England recommendations are both \"frustrating and inconsistent\". He claims GPs are under constant pressure to reduce prescribing costs, but then have to deal with criticism from upset patients. As such, any future decisions should be made on a \"case-by-case basis\". 'False economy' Julia Mackinder from Wimbledon has type 1 diabetes. This means having to inject insulin a minimum of four times a day, using a fresh needle each time. Like Amanda and David, Julia's concern is that removing lifesaving items such as needles and testing strips could be a \"false economy\". \"There's a risk of infection and long-term damage which would cost the NHS long-term to treat,\" she says.

Magic Leap has not been seen in public, but reports suggest that its headgear projects images onto users' eyes. The show will be part of the Manchester International Festival next July. Titled The Age of Starlight, it is one of the first three productions to be announced for the 18-day event. Also on the line-up are a ballet created by choreographer Wayne McGregor, musician Jamie xx and artist Olafur Eliasson, and a family show telling the life story of children's TV favourite Mr Tumble. 'Transformative technology' In October, Magic Leap made headlines when it received $542 million (\u00a3346 million) from investors led by Google. Promotional videos suggest the technology will allow users to \"see\" computer-generated images in front of them as if those objects were really there. Now the Magic Leap team are working with Prof Cox, Framestore visual effects director Tim Webber - who won an Oscar for Gravity - plus Kevin Macdonald, who directed The Last King of Scotland and State of Play, and Manchester designer Peter Saville. Their show will address \"the deepest possible questions\" about the origins of the universe, Prof Cox said. \"It's the premiere of a technology that allows you to put digital images into your field of vision directly,\" he said. \"I saw the prototype in Miami a few months ago and it's stunning. \"It is going to be transformative technology, there's no doubt about that.\" The experience will \"disturb\" audiences and put them \"off balance\", he predicted. \"That's what it did when I saw it demonstrated.\" Prof Cox has presented TV documentaries including Human Universe and Wonders of Life.

Mr Farrer said the BID was \"unfair, unjust and snuck in\". The judge, sitting at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court, granted liability orders against 26 firms. The BID, created to support town centre shops, launched in April after being backed by a poll of business owners. Furniture seller Mr Farrer, a member of Test Valley Borough Council, told the court the authority had cast votes on behalf of 13 car parks in order to achieve a three-vote majority in favour. He told the court: \"Andover town centre is on its knees. I can't afford it. \"Ninety-three per cent of people in Andover say this was unjust and unfair.\" Judge Timothy Pattinson heard complaints from four other Andover traders before granting the orders to the council, which collects the BID levies. Mr Farrer then left the court shouting: \"I just resigned. I can't work with hypocrisy. That's another closed shop.\" Afterwards the Andover Alliance party member said he would continue to refuse to pay, despite being warned by the judge that he could be jailed. \"BIDs across the country are a cancer against retail businesses,\" he said. \"Why would you enforce a tax on an already-struggling high street?\" Andover BID manager Steve Godwin said the company would collect \u00a31m in levies over five years to be spent on projects including fairs, free wi-fi for shoppers and a radio security system.

In 2002 a French court convicted him of defending the use of torture. He was stripped of his Legion of Honour, one of France's top merit awards, after the book appeared. Aussaresses never regretted the use of torture. He said \"it became legitimate when the situation demanded it\". He also maintained that the government of the day was not only aware of the atrocities, but also approved them. A member of the National Liberation Front (FLN) who fought in the war, Louisette Ighilahriz, said Aussaresses should have expressed remorse. \"He was honest. He admitted torturing Algerians... But he didn't go all the way. He should have expressed regret,\" she told the AFP news agency. Man of war Born in November 1918 at Saint Paul Cap de Joux in the south of France, Aussaresses enlisted in the French secret services and went on to found the counter-espionage unit. In 1957 he was approached to establish order in Algeria. He himself described the unit he was heading as a \"death squad\" that was charged with carrying out night raids, torture and the removal of certain detainees. After the Algerian war he went to lecture the US special forces at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in the \"techniques of the Battle of Algiers\" including the use of torture. Analysts say many of those techniques were used during the Vietnam War. In 1973, he was sent to Brazil during the military dictatorship as French military attache. In a statement to the French broadcaster, France 24, the French rights group, Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT) said that \"during his career Aussaresses not only practiced torture, but also taught the techniques of torture in clandestine programmes with Latin American dictatorships in the 1970s\".

It has been reported that Lynton Crosby, the prime minister's adviser, is keen to abandon the plan. Mr Clegg said he had so far been unable to secure agreement for the register from both sides of the coalition. Lobbyists are firms or individuals which are paid to influence government decisions. They are often former politicians or civil servants who have developed personal contacts with those in power. Scandal In recent years there have been several scandals involving lobbying, including the resignation of Defence Secretary Liam Fox. Mr Fox allowed defence industry lobbyist Adam Werritty, Mr Fox's former flat mate, to accompany him on foreign trips where he met diplomats, defence staff and defence contractors. Fox said he had \"mistakenly allowed\" personal and professional responsibilities to be \"blurred\". Before the last election, Mr Cameron said of lobbying: \"It is the next big scandal waiting to happen. \"It's an issue that crosses party lines and has tainted our politics for too long, an issue that exposes the far-too-cosy relationship between politics, government, business and money.\" The coalition agreement, which set out the government's programme in 2010, said: \"We will regulate lobbying through introducing a statutory register of lobbyists and ensuring greater transparency.\" Mr Clegg said: \"I do think we need to just honour what we said in the coalition agreement...

The escapees were caught in China's Yunnan province. North Korean refugees tend to make their journey to South Korea by first heading to China. China often repatriates them to the North, ruling them economic migrants. China is North Korea's only ally and a major trading partner. \"The DPRK [North Korea] calls upon the countries concerned... to send back its inhabitants as early as possible as required by international law,\" a statement by North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said on Friday. It described those who helped the defectors as \"agents and human traffic dealers of the South Korean Intelligence Service\" and accused them of \"abducting inhabitants of the DPRK to forcibly take them to South Korea\". Rights groups say refugees who are repatriated can face punishment and imprisonment. In June, the UN said it was dismayed over reports that China and Laos forcibly repatriated nine young North Korean refugees. Escaping North Korea is extremely difficult as all its borders are heavily patrolled. Most North Korean refugees leave via China and head for nations in South East Asia, from where they can get to South Korea - which provides financial assistance and training. However, the number of North Korean refugees arriving in South Korea dropped by 40% last year. Activists say North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is taking stronger measures to prevent people from trying to leave.

He was speaking after the council's standards committee found former Tory leader Derrick Murphy had brought the office of leader into disrepute. The council said its code was approved by the Local Government Association. Mr Murphy stood down as council leader in January ahead of a standards committee hearing into allegations against him. They related to an email sent to the BBC by a political assistant at County Hall at Mr Murphy's request, allegedly disparaging West Norfolk Council leader Nick Daubney. Mr Murphy was cleared of various accusations but found to have brought the office of leader into disrepute and ordered to undergo ethics training. He did not contest his Freebridge Lynn seat in last month's local elections and is no longer a councillor. 'Storing up problems' Mr Murphy has now made a formal complaint to the Local Government Ombudsman about the standards investigation. He alleges the council did not apply its new code of conduct during its investigation and that members of the standards committee had not been trained. A spokesman for the Local Government Ombudsman was unable to confirm whether the complaint had been received. Mr Neill said: \"Norfolk County Council is storing up huge problems for itself by continuing to enforce a code of conduct that is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. \"It could learn a great deal from other authorities, like South Norfolk District Council, which have made the simple transition to a set of new standards arrangements that are light-touch and good for local democracy.\" Mr Neill also criticised the council's \"highly unusual\" decision to employ barrister Jenni Richards QC and another lawyer to conduct its investigation, at a cost of \u00a344,000.

Toby, from Osmondthorpe, Leeds, became ill at Christmas 2016 and on his fourth birthday in January 2017 his family was told he had a stage four neuroblastoma tumour. He had struck up relationships with several players and staff at Elland Road. Last year the club raised the \u00a3200,000 needed to fund his cancer treatment. Tributes have poured in since news of his death emerged. A statement said he died \"in the arms of mummy and daddy\" at home with all his family around him on Saturday afternoon.

Feminine forms for jobs like prosecutor or firefighter are already often used. But until recently the academy objected to such changes as \"barbaric\". In its report it said \"the academy considers that all developments aiming at recognising in language the place of women in today's society can be foreseen, as long as they do not contravene the elementary and fundamental rules of language\". It will now accept, for example, professeure for a woman teacher instead of the masculine professeur. But the male-dominated body, which dates back to the 17th Century, said it would not draw up an \"exhaustive list\" of names, accepting that it would be an insurmountable task. It pointed out that several feminine versions of auteur (author) had already come into usage, including auteure, autoresse and autrice. What other names may change? Some French jobs already have feminine forms such as infirmi\u00e8re (nurse) but the vast majority of job titles are masculine. The feminine definitive article is commonly used to distinguish between sexes, for example la juge (judge) or la ministre (minister). Any changes may simply be a matter of making formal a job title that already exists. Some will just have an extra \"e\" as a suffix and maybe an accent, such as pr\u00e9f\u00e8te (prefect), d\u00e9put\u00e9e (MP) avocate (lawyer) and procureure (prosecutor).

The prime minister says it is unfair housing benefit claimants can live in properties other workers could only dream of. His opponents argue - in the strongest terms - the policies are profoundly unfair. Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant said they would lead to the \"cleansing\" of the poor from expensive areas. A government impact assessment provides plenty of numbers over which both sides of the debate can argue. It shows the restriction of Local Housing Allowances - which are currently based on the median rent in an area - to the 30th percentile of private rents will affect 774,970 households across the UK, who will lose an average of \u00a39 a week. Substantial saving New limits on the amount paid according to the size of a property, including a cap of \u00a3400 a week on a four bedroom house, will affect fewer households more dramatically. A total of 21,060 will lose on average \u00a374 per week. The percentage of privately rented properties available to housing benefit claimants in central London will fall from more than 50% to just 7%. That impact will be felt most keenly in expensive inner city areas, but some MPs in the suburbs are said to be anxious about the impact of a possible influx of would-be residents. Labour MPs are keen to point out this is not just a discussion about the unemployed. There are 680,000 working households claiming housing benefit, 14% of the total housing benefit caseload. And yet there is one rather straightforward number the government would have us bear in mind considering all this. Housing benefit payments cost the taxpayer around \u00a320bn a year. As housing minister Grant Shapps pointed out to a Parliamentary committee recently, that is roughly equivalent to the police and the whole of the universities' budgets put together.

But this summer, La Isla's team captain played as a pro in Mexico. \"I never thought it'd be possible,\" Michel Enriquez admits, back in his hometown of Nueva Gerona. But the small experiment he was part of is now being rolled out across baseball and other sports. In a huge policy swing, Cuba says it will allow players to sign for professional sides abroad. \"I think it's very positive,\" Enriquez says, as he drives to a training session ahead of the season's first home game. He manoeuvres the silver saloon slowly through the narrow streets to avoid other traffic, mostly horse-drawn carts and bicycles with extra passengers balanced precariously on the handlebars. His car was a recent reward for his years representing Cuba at the highest level. Before that, he would catch the bus or hitch a lift to training like everyone else. Like all Cuban athletes, the star third baseman received a salary linked to a phantom profession - a state job he never did as he was playing baseball full time - of around $23 (\u00a314) a month, plus bonuses for his many medals. But Enriquez says that by playing in Mexico for just one month before he got injured, he earned \"$5,000 or $6,000\" (\u00a33,075-3,700). \"We're moving away from the idea that the state has to look after us, and we're taking care of ourselves,\" says Enriquez, explaining how the policy change has made it possible for him to buy furniture, furnish his kitchen and install air conditioning in his home. \"I think it's a big advantage. We can afford things with our own salaries and don't have to wait for gifts from the state,\" he argues. State cut There are restrictions built into the new arrangement.

Mr Irving said he wanted to send a \"massive thank you\" to everyone who supported the men during their time in India. He told reporters at the airport: \"I just want to thank everyone, they've been so kind. \"Thank you for your support, thank you so much. It feels excellent to be home.\" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the men's return was \"wonderful news\" and added their families and campaigners would be \"delighted to see them return home after being separated for so long\". The men were working on the anti-piracy ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio, owned by the US-based company AdvanFort, when they were arrested in 2013. They were held along with three Ukrainians, 14 Estonians and 12 Indians when customs officials and police found weapons and ammunition on board, which Indian authorities said had not been properly declared.

Nick Dunn from Ashington, Northumberland Billy Irving from Connel, Argyll Ray Tindall from Chester Paul Towers from Pocklington, East Yorkshire John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria Nicholas Simpson from Catterick, North Yorkshire Initially the charges were quashed when the men argued the weapons were lawfully held for anti-piracy purposes and the paperwork, issued by the UK government, was in order.

This was the first genocide verdict given by the UN-backed tribunal on Pol Pot's brutal 1975-1979 regime. Up to two million people, mostly from the Khmer majority, are believed to have died during those four years. But the larger-scale killings of the Cambodian population do not fit the narrow definition of genocide under international law, says BBC South East Asia correspondent Jonathan Head, and have instead been prosecuted as crimes against humanity. Friday's verdicts will almost certainly be the last from an unusual attempt at transnational justice that has lasted more than a decade, our correspondent adds. The pair were also found guilty of a litany of other crimes, including the crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, enslavement and torture. The two men - already serving life sentences for crimes against humanity from a separate trial - have again been sentenced to life. They are two of only three people ever convicted by the tribunal, which has faced criticism for its slow pace and for being subject to alleged political interference. Judge Nil Nonn read out the lengthy and much-anticipated ruling to a courtroom in Phnom Penh full of people who suffered under the Khmer Rouge. He described the terror of the regime, and spoke of forced marriages where couples were ordered to have children. But the landmark moment came when Nuon Chea was found guilty of genocide for the attempt to wipe out Cham Muslims and ethnic Vietnamese Cambodians, and Khieu Samphan was found guilty of genocide against the ethnic Vietnamese. Researchers estimate that 36% of the Cham population of 300,000 died under the Khmer Rouge. Most of the Vietnamese community were deported, and the 20,000 who remained were all killed. Why is the genocide verdict significant? The Khmer Rouge's crimes have long been referred to as the \"Cambodian ge\n\nSummary:","463":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The former soldier - who was suspended by Labour following the fracas - has already announced his intention not to seek re-election in 2015. 'Too many Tories' Police were called to the Palace of Westminster following reports of a disturbance shortly before closing time on 22 February. The MP had been singing loudly, and lashed out after declaring there were \"too many\" Tories in the bar. He pleaded guilty to four charges, including one of assault by beating, and was given a fine, a 12-month community order which included a curfew from Friday to Sunday, and was ordered to pay \u00a31,400 in compensation to his victims. In a statement to the Commons, Joyce apologised to Conservative MPs Stuart Andrew, Jackie Doyle-Price, Andrew Percy and Alec Shelbrooke, as well as Labour MP and whip Phil Wilson. Mr Andrew, MP for Pudsey, was headbutted by Joyce, while Mr Wilson, who represents Sedgefield, was also assaulted. Joyce also apologised to Tory councillors Luke Mackenzie and Ben Maney, whom he hit, to police officers who attended the incident and to \"everyone else affected by my actions that evening\". \"That will clearly not be an exhaustive list,\" he told the House.

The stock opened at HK$94.50 (\u00a39.13 ; $12.19), well above the list price of $9.11. The company raised $3.48bn and was valued at $29bn ahead of its trading debut. JD.com will still retain a majority stake in JD health, which will remain a subsidiary of the e-commerce giant. The company hopes to cash in on China's large and growing market for health services and pharmaceuticals. According to the consultancy Frost and Sullivan, China is the world's second-largest market for health care, reaching $998bn in 2019. What is JD Health? JD Health started as an online pharmaceutical and healthcare product retailer, but has branched out into other healthcare services. The firm's IPO prospectus showed it had 72.5 million annual active users as of June 30, compared to 53.5 million at the same time last year. It is one of China's biggest pharmaceutical retailers, selling both to businesses and consumers, with a 30-minute drug delivery service to its users. The company also offers a variety of online telemedicine services, including specialist medical services and traditional Chinese medicine. JD Health launched an online primary care channel in August, with a target of serving 50 million Chinese families in the next five years. According to the prospectus, the company makes more than 80% of its revenues from pharmaceutical and healthcare products. However, the company said that in the first half of 2020, it had an average of approximately 90,000 daily online consultations, an almost six-fold increase from the same quarter in 2019. More listings ahead JD Health isn't the only division of JD.com that's expected to list.

Actresses Taraji P Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae cried as they watched clips ahead of an on-stage Q&A. Henson apologised afterwards for being so overwhelmed. \"I never got into acting for the accolades. I'm a girl from the hood. I didn't grow up with much, so all I had was dreams and hope,\" she said. \"This story is so important. Had I known about these women coming up, maybe I would have aspired to be a rocket scientist.\" In Hidden Figures, Henson plays mathematician Katherine Johnson, alongside Nasa colleagues Dorothy Vaughan (Spencer) and Mary Jackson (Monae). Cameron Bailey, the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival, said the women had been a \"visionary trio who had crossed race and gender lines\". The cast also includes Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst and Big Bang Theory star Jim Parsons. Spencer said her character Dorothy \"could disassemble anything and put it back together\", a skill she had used to fix Nasa's IBM computer. \"No women, not black or white, were mentioned in Apollo 13 or all of these other movies,\" Spencer said, adding that she was sad that the real Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson had not lived to see their story told on film. \"But I'm excited that Katherine Johnson will,\" she said, her voice breaking with emotion. \"I just want her to be proud,\" added Henson. \"People come up to me and they're like, 'Oh, Oscars!' Everybody wants to put on that pressure. \"I don't accept that pressure - I'll let you all say it - but what I was most concerned about was if Katherine would be proud, because she's still alive - this is her story.\" The film, directed by Theodore Melfi, is due out in early 2017.

Morrissey has previously expressed support for the far-right For Britain party and earlier this month wore a badge with its logo on during a TV show, but he denies he is a racist. Merseyrail apologised and said the posters did not reflect its \"values\". The adverts, which contain no political message, were removed after a traveller on a Southport service to Moorfields contacted the company to ask if it agreed with Morrissey's opinions. The man, who asked not to be named, told the BBC he was not \"offended\" by the posters and did not demand they were taken down. He said he just questioned the company on whether they were appropriate. In a statement, Merseyrail said: \"Any content used within advertising on the Merseyrail network does not reflect the organisation's values and we apologise for any offence the publication of these posters may have caused.\" The company said advertising was managed by an external third party. Morrisey has not responded to the rail company's decision. But in a message on his website on Friday, he said: \"With voice extended to breaking point, I call for the prosperity of free speech; the eradication of totalitarian control; I call for diversity of opinion; I call for the total abolition of the abattoir; I call for peace, above all; I call for civil society.\" Earlier this week, the world's oldest record shop, Spillers Records in Cardiff, took the decision to stop selling Morrissey albums.

It is asking people to use a mobile phone app to record problems found on rights of way, such as blockages or fallen trees, and send them in. The Big Pathwatch will then allow the Ramblers to protect the path network. 'Crisis point' There are 140,000 miles of pathways across England and Wales but the Ramblers fear more and more are becoming overgrown, flooded or blocked. More than 86,000 problems were reported on England's paths alone last year, including missing signs and broken gates. Ramblers chief executive Benedict Southworth said the path network was \"one of our nation's biggest assets\". He said: \"We know that there are currently problems on our paths that stop people in their tracks. \"We need to find the true extent of the problem and explore how this affects anyone who uses our paths, whether that's on their shortcut to the shops or while they're out enjoying our glorious countryside. \"With a 20% cut in the workforce looking after our paths over the last five years, it's no surprise that these problems appear to be mounting and that we've now reached this crisis point.\" Are Britain's footpaths in slow decay?

A JCS official said at least one of the missiles travelled about 690km (428 miles) and appeared to be a new design. It marks the first time North Korea has fired any missiles since leader Kim Jong-un's impromptu meeting with Donald Trump late last month. It also comes after anger from the North over planned military exercises between South Korea and the US, an annual event. The North warned they could affect the resumption of denuclearisation talks. The first missile was launched at about 05:34 Thursday local time (20:34 GMT Wednesday) and the second at 05:57, said the JCS. Initial reports said both missiles travelled about 430km, reaching an altitude of 50km, before falling into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea. But after analysis from US and South Korean intelligence officials, the JCS said at least one was likely to have been a \"new type of missile\". Japan's defence minister said the launches did not reach Japanese waters and had no immediate impact on its national security. It is not clear if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw Thursday's launch. South Korea's defence ministry has urged Pyongyang to stop acts that it said were unhelpful for easing tension, reported Reuters.

Two Scottish sites have announced plans to bid for the spaceport licences - Prestwick airport and Machrihanish. However, the government said there was currently no timetable for the introduction of the bill. There is a growing market for launching small or nano satellites which could be used for communications such as broadband. The Scottish sites want to tap into this market and also lay down the infrastructure for future developments such as space tourism. Legislation concerning space is reserved to Westminster. The UK's government's Department for Transport (DfT) is responsible for the Modern Transport Bill, which would set regulations for driverless cars as well as allowing UK aerodromes to access space. It told BBC Scotland that it had been working hard on the bill but parliamentary time had been limited by events such as Brexit and the discussions over triggering Article 50. A spokeswoman for the DfT said: \"The final date for the introduction of the Modern Transport Bill will be announced in due course. \"We are creating the legislative and regulatory framework to allow the development of spaceports in the UK. It will be for the market to decide where the first spaceport will be established.\" Prestwick airport's director of spaceport development Richard Jenner said it had done a lot of work in preparation for applying for a spaceport licence.

It is 18 months since a promise retail would be made a priority, but there is frustration at a lack of progress. The Welsh Government said it \"remained committed\" to working with retailers. Sara Jones, head of the WRC, said: \"Young people don't always see retail as their first choice when it comes to a career option, but it's a hugely meritocratic industry. \"It's a fantastic place to work, great opportunities, the total reward you get from being part of the industry can be something to be proud of and something hopefully people will want to work in.\" But there is disappointment about the range of apprenticeships offered, compared to the digital and tech economy. Lucy Dolton, store manager at Debenhams in Cardiff, joined 13 years ago as a graduate trainee. She said retail can offer a rewarding career and a chance to progress - and companies link-up with schools to try to get the message across. \"When I finished uni there were so many options - I did what made the most sense at the time and chose something that I loved - which was shopping,\" she said. \"I hoped I'd liked it - and found I really loved it. Every day is different, it's exciting, dynamic, the people you meet, you can never get bored.

But Mohamed al-Taher Siala told an Austrian newspaper that all North African countries reject the idea. Instead, he said, Libya was working with its southern neighbours to reinforce their common borders. Mr Siala is foreign minister for Libya's UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). The GNA is nominally in power in the capital, Tripoli, but rival political factions and militias occupy much of the rest of the country. Libya has been mired in political chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. What is the EU plan? In June, the EU proposed \"regional disembarkation platforms\" in North Africa, where the UN and other agencies could screen those who have a genuine claim to asylum in Europe. Those not eligible would be offered help to resettle in their home countries. The plan was to break the business model of people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. The move followed complaints from Italy, which has long been the main arrival point for boatloads of migrants from African countries fleeing poverty and violence. According to the United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018. What has Libya said? \"All North African countries reject this proposal - Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Libya, as well,\" Mr Siala told the Austrian newspaper Die Presse.

On 10 August, Turkey sent the seismic research ship Oruc Reis, accompanied by two auxiliary vessels, to search for potentially rich oil and gas deposits south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo. At the time, the Greek foreign ministry called the move a \"new serious escalation\" which \"exposed\" Turkey's \"destabilising role\". There are also tensions around Cyprus over rival exploration rights. The Republic of Cyprus and Greece do not accept any such rights for Turkish-controlled northern Cyprus in the region. On Sunday, Mr Akar confirmed that the Oruc Reis had returned to Turkish waters. Ship-tracking websites showed it near the port of Antalya. \"There will be planned movements backwards and forwards,\" Mr Akar told state news agency Anadolu. Last week, Turkey's navy said that the Oruc Reis would continue operations in the area until 12 September. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said exploratory work would continue but there were no plans so far for an extension to the ship's mission. The Turkish pro-government newspaper, Yeni Safak, said the decision not to extend the ship's mission was \"a step towards giving diplomacy a chance\". \"This is a positive first step.

It shows 4,628 such incidents recorded in 2012-13, compared with 5,389 in the previous year. The victims of the incidents were overwhelmingly male. White British people and those of Pakistani origin each made up 23% of the total. The figures indicated that 36% of the victims were in the age group 26-35. Of the former police areas, all but Strathclyde were able to provide a more detailed breakdown of the ethnic origin of those complaining about a racist incident. In those areas, 19% were of Pakistani origin, 16% were recorded as \"other white\" and 13% were \"white Scottish\". The category \"white English\" was recorded for 5% of victims. Where the perpetrators were known, 37% were aged 20 or under. Zero tolerance Community Safety Minister Roseanna Cunningham welcomed the decrease, but added: \"Racism is completely unacceptable and we cannot allow the actions of a minority to spoil this country's reputation as a warm, welcoming, tolerant nation where diversity is valued.\" Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC said: \"The decreasing trend generally is welcomed but I too would warn against complacency. \"It was interesting to note that many of the racist incidents recorded were committed in the street on a Friday and Saturday night. It is my view that many racially-motivated offences are linked to social disorder and this is a cause for concern for law enforcement. \"The Scottish prosecution service has a zero-tolerance approach for any hate crime and I would urge the public to continue to report all such offences to the police. They can have the confidence that crimes of racial hatred, bigotry and prejudice will be investigated carefully and sensitively and prosecuted robustly.\"\n\nSummary:","480":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It was commissioned after complaints about managers and other employees. The trust said it was investing in staff support services and developing new training for managers. The inquiry found a third of the 4,500 staff had witnessed bullying, mostly of their colleagues but also of managers. Some staff said they felt intimidated in the workplace by sexual behaviour. More news and stories from Devon and Cornwall Report author Prof Duncan Lewis, of Plymouth University, said \"budgetary pressures and rising demands\" had \"led to tensions between all grades of staff\" which \"can develop into bullying and harassment\". Chris Nelson of Unison said that \"for too long the culture within areas of the ambulance service has been all wrong\". He said \"inaction of some managers meant that bullying and other bad behaviour was effectively given the green light\". \"Whenever staff complained, they felt that the perpetrators were let off the hook, and sent away with a slap on the wrist, or a training course at best,\" he said. Trust chief executive Ken Wenman said \"inappropriate behaviour\" by staff included \"banter that may have been acceptable years ago, but is not acceptable today\". He said the report would be a \"catalyst for significant change\", with the trust developing new training for managers and investing in staff support services.

Holyrood has not backed the bill but there was little time on Tuesday for MPs to discuss their concerns. The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford described the lack of debate \"a democratic outrage\". Scottish Labour's Ian Murray accused the UK government of failing to provide adequate time. But Scottish Secretary David Mundell insisted the voices of the people of the UK as a whole had been listened to and acted on. Mr Mundell said he was \"very disappointed\" by the lack of devolved consent, but insisted that \"the bill can prevail without it\". The Scottish government, however, says its wants changes to the devolution settlement. MPs are debating the EU Withdrawal Bill, the UK government's flagship piece of Brexit legislation, across two marathon sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday. The government saw off a move to give MPs the decisive say on what happens over Brexit if they do not agree with the deal it negotiates, winning the key vote by 324 to 298. Devolution was to be debated in the second half of Tuesday's session, but there were only a few minutes left for this after voting on amendments went on for almost three hours. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We were continually promised by David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, that he would bring forward amendments, that we would have debate in the House of Commons. \"What happened last night was a democratic outrage.

Both men say they had consensual sex. The woman said she has no memory of the incident and the prosecution at Caernarfon Crown Court argues she was too drunk to consent to sex. But jurors heard how Mr McDonald told police the girl was not \"slurring her words and falling all over the place\". In police interviews read to the jury, Liverpool-born Mr McDonald said Mr Evans, originally from St Asaph, Denbighshire, had invited him on a night out in the seaside town on a Bank Holiday weekend. Questioned by Det Con Philip Williams, Mr McDonald said he met the complainant at the end of the night out, in the early hours of Monday, 30 May, 2011 as the footballers were standing with friends near a takeaway. A fight broke out among other revellers and Mr McDonald said he decided to move away from the disturbance. \"I was looking to get a taxi, I just wanted to go home,\" he told police. He said he was \"tipsy\" after the night out but \"knew what he was doing\". He \"bumped into\" the woman on a corner and asked her where she was going, to which she replied: \"Where are you going?\" 'Pretty' He said he told her he was going back to his hotel and she responded: \"I'm going with you.\" Mr McDonald described the woman as \"pretty\".

The extradition ruling will be passed to the Home Secretary for approval. If he is sent home from the UK and found guilty, it will be a spectacular fall from grace for a man whose lifestyle brands have achieved global recognition and who has even spent time as a politician. Mr Mallya became chairman of conglomerate United Breweries Group in 1983 aged just 28, inheriting the job when his father died. It is best known for producing Kingfisher, India's most popular beer, but has also branched out into chemicals, paints and publishing, buying The Asian Age newspaper and Bollywood film magazine Cine Blitz. However, the businessman's more recent ventures have courted controversy. Kingfisher Airlines, launched in 2005, grew to become India's second largest domestic carrier, but racked up debts of more than $1bn (\u00a3755m) - much of which remains outstanding. It was wound down in 2012 amid reports that pilots and cabin crew had worked unpaid for 15 months. Mr Mallya was also forced to resign as chairman of United Spirits, India's biggest distiller, after its new owner Diageo accused him of financial wrongdoing. Diageo is now suing the tycoon to recover payments worth $181m. Despite the controversies Mr Mallya has maintained his trademark flamboyance and indulged his passions. He helped co-found a Formula 1 team, Force India (although it went into administration in July when his assets were frozen), and bought Indian Premier League cricket franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for more than \u00a370m.

However, he blamed other firms for giving misleading information and said fire safety rules were \"not robust\". It came after protests at the hearing. The second stage of the inquiry into the tragedy on 14 June 2017 is looking into how the 24-storey tower in west London came to be covered in flammable cladding during its refurbishment between 2012 and 2016. Studio E was given the task of renovating Grenfell Tower because it was working on a new school and leisure centre nearby. During nearly five hours of questioning Mr Kuszell told the inquiry: \"Hindsight now comes into play - we've lived two-and-a-half years since the tragedy and doubtless absolutely every one of us would wish to turn the clock back.\" He also said his company lacked experience in working on tall buildings and that \"if we (Studio E) had understood that building regulations were not robust\" the tragedy might not have happened. \"It really shouldn't have happened, and I'm really, really sorry for all of you and everybody else who was involved in the project,\" he said. \"Because I can only say to you from my heart that we really wanted to do the absolute best on this project as we could which is why I didn't enjoy having the project being described as an add-on because in our hearts it wasn't an add-on at all.\" Protests Monday's hearing was the first time the inquiry has sat since last week's decision by Attorney General Suella Braverman to guarantee some witnesses will not be prosecuted on the basis of what they say at the inquiry.

The pair first met at the British Fashion Awards in 2016 and are now \"close friends\", says GQ on its website. But the cover has fuelled more speculation the pair are dating. The supermodel teased the images from the shoot on Instagram before the full cover was released on Thursday. The pair were first introduced by British Vogue editor Edward Enninful at the awards and went on to the after party together, according to GQ. \"A series of Instagram images with love heart emojis chronicle the friendship that blossomed, which, this year, took a professional turn,\" the magazine says. The pair have teamed up together to work on a new underwear line as part of Skepta's MAINS fashion collection. For the GQ cover shoot, both Skepta and Naomi Campbell are pictured in the brand's boxer shorts. GQ haven't released any more pictures or details of the interview with the pair but says they talk about \"race, sex, love and power\". Although they've never confirmed an official relationship, fans have speculated for a while that they're more than friends. Skepta, whose real name is Joseph Junior Adenuga, has had a meteoric rise and is currently viewed as one of the trailblazers of the grime music scene. That was cemented last year when the 35-year-old's album, Konnichiwa, won the Mercury prize for album of the year.

An elderly couple staying at a site in East Yorkshire fear they will be risking their health if they leave. Margerie Thaw and her husband usually live with their daughter and her family. But they moved out to the site in the grounds of Burton Constable stately home, which has 430 homes, and are concerned about the impact moving back could have on their health. \"Out daughter is at-risk - she has diabetes and asthma - and her husband is still working and there's two children,\" Mrs Thaw said. \"So what happens there? We'll be at-risk.\" Mr Johnson told the country it was facing a \"moment of national emergency\" and that staying at home was necessary to protect the NHS, save lives and tackle \"the biggest threat this country has faced for decades\". New measures include a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and restrictions on people leaving their homes, except for food shopping or for medical treatment medicine, exercise or travelling to work in an essential job. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has also issued a statement which says exceptions had been made for people who live permanently in caravan parks or \"where their primary residence is not available\". After receiving guidance from the industry's trade association, Burton Constable Holiday Park sent a letter to residents which said it would close and access barriers would be deactivated by 16:00 GMT on Wednesday.

Corroboration - the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources - has been a requirement in Scots law for centuries. The Scottish government wants to remove the barriers that might prevent cases such as rape being taken forward. It said the requirement for corroboration could prevent strong cases being prosecuted and the reforms represents a move towards focusing on the best quality of evidence available, rather than meeting an outdated technical requirement. In an interview with Holyrood Magazine, Lord Hope - who was deputy president of the UK Supreme Court until four months ago - said he was concerned that without corroboration people could be convicted because they had confessed to a crime. He was quoted by the magazine as saying: \"I just express concern that the proposal seems very far-reaching and, potentially, quite dangerous if you have a situation where somebody is at risk of being convicted on his own confession which I would have thought was absolutely fundamentally wrong in Scots law. \"It may be that the number of cases that go to trial now on confessions are comparatively few, but we developed our law of corroboration initially as a barrier against people being taken to court on a confession which had been extracted by torture. \"This is in the early 18th century when things were very, very different, and people reacted against this, and I'd be very sad to see that kind of protection go.\" 'More selective' He acknowledged there was a \"real problem\" with cases which take place where there are no witnesses other than the victim and accused, such as many rapes and sexual assaults.

Mrs Tucker, who together with her husband David runs the small firm London Walks, will be leading no fewer than five two-hour Charles Dickens Christmas Day Walks.

Between 30 and 40 people are expected to join each time, paying \u00a39 a head. Mrs Tucker says the tour has a special resonance on Christmas Day, due, of course, to Dickens's famous novel A Christmas Carol. \"Dickens almost invented Christmas as we know it today,\" says Mrs Tucker. \"It's fun and people are appreciative. It's very appropriate, too, because of Dickens's connection to Christmas, and also because he was a great walker as well.\" She says that London Walks decided to start organising walks on Christmas Day several years ago, and found they were more popular than they'd anticipated. \"For my family it's not difficult because my husband's one of the guides too,\" she adds. \"When we have Christmas at my mum's in the evening, we really feel we've earned it.\" Father Christmas The Min Jiang restaurant on the top floor of the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington is one of just a handful of Chinese restaurants open in London on Christmas Day.

Most employers will look at a person's online presence before even selection for interview - let alone the final appointment decision. Profile checking Reed is one of the country's biggest recruitment agencies. Laura Holden, from Reed, says: \"Recruiters may review the digital profiles of candidates they're interviewing or looking to hire, as it's a quick and easy way to learn more about the individual.\" A recent survey from reed.co.uk found that 43% of recruiters check digital profiles often. Other surveys show the vast majority, upwards of 80%, look at least once at a candidate's online presence. And it isn't snooping, it is perfectly legal for a prospective employer - or anyone - to look at whatever they like.

Outstanding \"The new jobs will offer an average salary of \u00a333,000, providing excellent opportunities for graduate and experienced IT professionals as well as school leavers.\" Invest Northern Ireland has offered Tullett Prebon over \u00a32m towards the creation of the new jobs with the Department for the Economy Assured Skills programme providing \u00a3400k for associated training. Analysis: BBC NI business correspondent Julian O'Neill The announcement of 300 jobs is the largest the Northern Ireland executive has been able to unveil in ten months. It continues Belfast's track record of attracting well paid jobs in the financial services sector. Negotiations about the jobs took a year to conclude and were set in motion long before the EU referendum, the outcome of which did not torpedo an important inward investment. The executive and Invest NI are very keen to project a business-as-usual message and this announcement aids that narrative. But beneath the surface, the DUP and Sinn Fein are deeply at odds over what a Brexit future holds for the local economy. Tuesday's announcement will be welcomed all round, but nothing can really be read into its wider significance vis-\u00e0-vis Brexit and whether that will disadvantage Northern Ireland's chance of inward investment. Luke Barnett, of Tullett Prebon, said: \"We are delighted to announce the launch of our technology centre in Northern Ireland. \"We looked at many potential locations and Belfast was the outstanding choice. \"The combination of a h\n\nSummary:","497":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Mr Kashgari's controversial tweet last week sparked more than 30,000 responses and several death threats. Insulting the prophet is considered blasphemous in Islam and is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. Mr Kashgari, 23, fled Saudi Arabia last week and was detained upon his arrival in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur on Thursday. He had tweeted his doubts about Muhammad on the prophet's birthday last week. Saudi clerics condemned his remarks as blasphemous. Injunction Mr Kashgari apologised and deleted the tweet, but when he continued to receive threats, he left for Malaysia. The two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty but Malaysia has good relations with Saudi Arabia as a fellow Muslim country, says the BBC's Jennifer Pak, in Kuala Lumpur. Mr Kashgari's lawyer obtained an injunction on Sunday to allow him to stay in Malaysia until his case was heard, but it was too late, our correspondent says. \"The nature of the charges against the individual in this case are a matter for the Saudi Arabian authorities,\" Malaysia's home ministry said in a statement. Amnesty International has warned that Mr Kashgari could be executed in Saudi Arabia if he is found guilty of apostasy. \"If the Malaysian authorities hand over Hamza Kashgari to Saudi Arabia, they could end up complicit in any violations he suffers,\" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty's Middle East division.\n\nSummary:","498":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Her family said they just want to be able to lay her to rest. They have increased the reward for information from \u00a310,000 to \u00a330,000 with money from their own pockets. Her mother, Marilyn Payne, 72, said she and her husband John were now relying on the younger generation to keep the campaign to find out what happened going. She added that the anniversary of her daughter's disappearance has been the hardest this year. Mrs Payne said she and her husband are getting older and they have thought Nicola would not be found while they were still alive. She appealed to the younger members of her family: \"Please never give up, and if she's found please give her a good send off.\" Nicola's cousin Amanda Eales, who is helping to run the #findnicolapayne social media campaign, said: \"It won't go away because we won't allow it to go away.\" They are also launching Youtube channel in an attempt to spread the message more widely. Two men were cleared of Nicola's murder in 2015. West Midlands Police undertook a search of land around Coombe Abbey last year, after new information came to light. Nicola's body has never been found.\n\nSummary:","499":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The US magazine also promoted its March-April edition with a picture of its playmate of the month with the hashtag #NakedIsNormal. Some social media users welcomed the U-turn, describing it as a \"good call\", while others said the decision was taken \"because the magazines weren't selling too well. Too bad free porn is still easy to access\". On Monday, Mr Hefner wrote: \"I'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated. \"Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem,\" added the 25-year-old son of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner. Playboy: Were no nudes good news? Samir Husni, a journalism professor at the University of Mississippi, said Playboy's ban on nudity had probably alienated more readers than it attracted. \"Playboy and the idea of non-nudity is sort of an oxymoron,\" he told the Associated Press. The magazine still had to find a way to appeal to a younger audience in a digital age where nudity has become commonplace, Mr Husni added. In next month's issue, the magazine will also revive some of its old franchises, including The Playboy Philosophy and Party Jokes. It also features an essay by actress Scarlett Byrne about the Free the Nipple campaign - a movement that started in the US to change laws around breastfeeding in public and female toplessness. Byrne writes \"about the importance of owning female sexuality and the double standards that still exist between women and men\", the magazine says. However, Playboy will drop the subtitle Entertainment for Men from its covers. \"Playboy will always be a lifestyle brand focused on men's interests, but as gender roles continue to evolve in society, so will we,\" Mr Hefner said. Playboy, which was founded in 1953, stopped printing nude photos in March 2016.\n\nSummary:"},"true_label":{"0":1,"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":1,"10":1,"11":1,"12":1,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1,"16":1,"17":1,"18":1,"19":1,"20":1,"21":1,"22":1,"23":1,"24":1,"25":1,"26":1,"27":1,"28":1,"29":1,"30":1,"31":1,"32":1,"33":1,"34":1,"35":1,"36":1,"37":1,"38":1,"39":1,"40":1,"41":1,"42":1,"43":1,"44":1,"45":1,"46":1,"47":1,"48":1,"49":1,"50":1,"51":1,"52":1,"53":1,"54":1,"55":1,"56":1,"57":1,"58":1,"59":1,"60":1,"61":1,"62":1,"63":1,"64":1,"65":1,"66":1,"67":1,"68":1,"69":1,"70":1,"71":1,"72":1,"73":1,"74":1,"75":1,"76":1,"77":1,"78":1,"79":1,"80":1,"81":1,"82":1,"83":1,"84":1,"85":1,"86":1,"87":1,"88":1,"89":1,"90":1,"91":1,"92":1,"93":1,"94":1,"95":1,"96":1,"97":1,"98":1,"99":1,"100":1,"101":1,"102":1,"103":1,"104":1,"105":1,"106":1,"107":1,"108":1,"109":1,"110":1,"111":1,"112":1,"113":1,"114":1,"115":1,"116":1,"117":1,"118":1,"119":1,"120":1,"121":1,"122":1,"123":1,"124":1,"125":1,"126":1,"127":1,"128":1,"129":1,"130":1,"131":1,"132":1,"133":1,"134":1,"135":1,"136":1,"137":1,"138":1,"139":1,"140":1,"141":1,"142":1,"143":1,"144":1,"145":1,"146":1,"147":1,"148":1,"149":1,"150":1,"151":1,"152":1,"153":1,"154":1,"155":1,"156":1,"157":1,"158":1,"159":1,"160":1,"161":1,"162":1,"163":1,"164":1,"165":1,"166":1,"167":1,"168":1,"169":1,"170":1,"171":1,"172":1,"173":1,"174":1,"175":1,"176":1,"177":1,"178":1,"179":1,"180":1,"181":1,"182":1,"183":1,"184":1,"185":1,"186":1,"187":1,"188":1,"189":1,"190":1,"191":1,"192":1,"193":1,"194":1,"195":1,"196":1,"197":1,"198":1,"199":1,"200":1,"201":1,"202":1,"203":1,"204":1,"205":1,"206":1,"207":1,"208":1,"209":1,"210":1,"211":1,"212":1,"213":1,"214":1,"215":1,"216":1,"217":1,"218":1,"219":1,"220":1,"221":1,"222":1,"223":1,"224":1,"225":1,"226":1,"227":1,"228":1,"229":1,"230":1,"231":1,"232":1,"233":1,"234":1,"235":1,"236":1,"237":1,"238":1,"239":1,"240":1,"241":1,"242":1,"243":1,"244":1,"245":1,"246":1,"247":1,"248":1,"249":1,"250":0,"251":0,"252":0,"253":0,"254":0,"255":0,"256":0,"257":0,"258":0,"259":0,"260":0,"261":0,"262":0,"263":0,"264":0,"265":0,"266":0,"267":0,"268":0,"269":0,"270":0,"271":0,"272":0,"273":0,"274":0,"275":0,"276":0,"277":0,"278":0,"279":0,"280":0,"281":0,"282":0,"283":0,"284":0,"285":0,"286":0,"287":0,"288":0,"289":0,"290":0,"291":0,"292":0,"293":0,"294":0,"295":0,"296":0,"297":0,"298":0,"299":0,"300":0,"301":0,"302":0,"303":0,"304":0,"305":0,"306":0,"307":0,"308":0,"309":0,"310":0,"311":0,"312":0,"313":0,"314":0,"315":0,"316":0,"317":0,"318":0,"319":0,"320":0,"321":0,"322":0,"323":0,"324":0,"325":0,"326":0,"327":0,"328":0,"329":0,"330":0,"331":0,"332":0,"333":0,"334":0,"335":0,"336":0,"337":0,"338":0,"339":0,"340":0,"341":0,"342":0,"343":0,"344":0,"345":0,"346":0,"347":0,"348":0,"349":0,"350":0,"351":0,"352":0,"353":0,"354":0,"355":0,"356":0,"357":0,"358":0,"359":0,"360":0,"361":0,"362":0,"363":0,"364":0,"365":0,"366":0,"367":0,"368":0,"369":0,"370":0,"371":0,"372":0,"373":0,"374":0,"375":0,"376":0,"377":0,"378":0,"379":0,"380":0,"381":0,"382":0,"383":0,"384":0,"385":0,"386":0,"387":0,"388":0,"389":0,"390":0,"391":0,"392":0,"393":0,"394":0,"395":0,"396":0,"397":0,"398":0,"399":0,"400":0,"401":0,"402":0,"403":0,"404":0,"405":0,"406":0,"407":0,"408":0,"409":0,"410":0,"411":0,"412":0,"413":0,"414":0,"415":0,"416":0,"417":0,"418":0,"419":0,"420":0,"421":0,"422":0,"423":0,"424":0,"425":0,"426":0,"427":0,"428":0,"429":0,"430":0,"431":0,"432":0,"433":0,"434":0,"435":0,"436":0,"437":0,"438":0,"439":0,"440":0,"441":0,"442":0,"443":0,"444":0,"445":0,"446":0,"447":0,"448":0,"449":0,"450":0,"451":0,"452":0,"453":0,"454":0,"455":0,"456":0,"457":0,"458":0,"459":0,"460":0,"461":0,"462":0,"463":0,"464":0,"465":0,"466":0,"467":0,"468":0,"469":0,"470":0,"471":0,"472":0,"473":0,"474":0,"475":0,"476":0,"477":0,"478":0,"479":0,"480":0,"481":0,"482":0,"483":0,"484":0,"485":0,"486":0,"487":0,"488":0,"489":0,"490":0,"491":0,"492":0,"493":0,"494":0,"495":0,"496":0,"497":0,"498":0,"499":0},"xlsum":{"0":"\u0921\u0949

The researchers studied ancient raindrops found in Ventersdorp, a town in the North West Province of South Africa, which is home to the Ventersdorp Supergroup, a rock formation that is 2.7 billion years old. 3. The pits that made up the ancient raindrops had diameters that could tell them something about ancient air pressure. This is because the terminal velocity, or speed, of a raindrop is dependent on air density. In modern conditions, the terminal velocity is about 9m\/s. 4. The results suggest that the air pressure 2.7 billion years ago was significantly different from today, with a terminal velocity of 4m\/s. This suggests that the air density was much lower, and that the raindrops would have had a different shape and trajectory than today's drops. 5. The researchers' findings have important implications for our understanding of ancient conditions, and could help to improve models of ancient climate and atmospheric conditions. 6.

In conclusion, the IFS report is broadly supportive of the government's plans, but with gloomy caveats.","216":"A developer has said he is \"pleading with you\" to refuse plans to demolish a former hotel in Bournemouth to make it a home for homeless people, the BBC has learned.br>br>A former hotel owner has said he is \"pleading with you\" to refuse plans to demolish a former hotel in Bournemouth to make it a home for homeless people.br>br>A former hotel owner has said he is \"pleading with you\" to refuse plans to demolish a former hotel in Bournemouth to make it a home for homeless people.br>br>A former hotel owner has said he is \"pleading with you\" to refuse plans to demolish a former hotel in Bournemouth to make it a home for homeless people.br>br>A former hotel owner has said he is \"pleading with you\" to refuse plans to demolish a former hotel in Bournemouth to make it a home for homeless people.br>br>A former hotel owner has said","217":"Belfast in June 2022, but it is unclear whether this will be possible.

The German carmaker is resisting settling with its domestic customers, claiming that there is no damage and therefore no cause for complaint. This trial is likely to last years, and while settling is unlikely to be a quick solution, the court would support such an effort. The lawsuit is a landmark one, and in terms of the sheer number of claimants, it's certainly attention grabbing. However, it may not be the biggest concern for Volkswagen right now, as the legal process is likely to take years and they expect it to take at least four. Even if they win, they could face a lengthy and expensive legal battle that could drag on for years to come.","219":"Key points summarized: Mr. Motivator, a black celebrity from Leicester, England, spoke about the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man killed by a white police officer, and recalled an early experience with racism.

In the UK, police only test for drugs if they suspect alcohol consumption and then require drivers to perform a field impairment test or walk in a straight line and count to 30. This type of testing was introduced in 2003, and since then more than 9,000 motorists have been convicted of drug driving in France. According to campaigner Michaela Groves, drivers who test positive for drug use should be subject to the same penalties as drink drivers. In the UK, police are not allowed to test for drugs at the roadside, and campaigners believe this is because they have not taken drug-impaired driving seriously enough. A police spokesperson in Dunkirk, France, said that drug-impaired drivers had a similar effect to drink drivers and that more drug tests should be conducted in the UK to make sure that drivers are not putting other people's lives in danger.","222":"Austrian airspace, in a video released on Monday.\u2019.&nbsp; The Austrian skydiver, Joe Baumgartner, said he was astonished to see his record smashed after he was filmed tumbling from a balloon.","223":"a.

The words to the song are \"soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\" and the show should have bought the rights to the lyrics.

In the show, one of the characters says that his mother used to sing the song to him when he was sick. The song has been featured on Big Bang Theory merchandise, from T-shirts to fridge magnets. According to the lawsuit, the show's producers sought permission in 2007 to use the lyrics from Willis Music Co - a Kentucky-based company that had published them in a book called Songs for the Nursery School. However, the lawsuit claims that Willis Music gave permission to use the lyrics without consulting Mrs Newlin's heirs, even though the book makes clear that Mrs Newlin was the author and owned the copyright to the lyrics.","229":"(1) Ceara Thacker was found dead in her halls of residence at the University of Liverpool in May 2018, after suffering mental health problems since she was 13.

The council has also invested in parking facilities in an attempt to alleviate the problem, but feels that more needs to be done. The scheme is expected to cost \u00a380 per year, and will require households and businesses to obtain a permit. The council has stated that the scheme is designed to be as fair as possible, and that it will be open to the public to give their opinions on the matter. The council has organised an event at Blackness Library where staff will be available to answer the public's questions on the proposals.
