President Porfirio Lobo said the move would free police officers for street patrols in crime-ridden neighborhoods. Public buses in Honduras are frequently attacked by gangs who rob passengers and extort money from drivers. The government began deploying troops on the streets last year in response to a public outcry over violent crime and the failure of the police to ensure security. Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, according to the UN, with much of the killing linked to drug-trafficking. President Lobo again blamed the international drug trade for the violence afflicting his country and said the government's misfortune lies in being a transit point for South American cocaine being smuggled to the US.","1":"Government reforms in 2012 pledged to cut down \"out-of-borough placements\" to help combat child sexual exploitation. Labour MP Ann Coffey used a Commons debate to say a \"sent-away generation\" is in danger of falling prey to paedophiles and drugs gangs. The government said placements \"should meet the needs of children\". Stockport MP Ms Coffey - chair of the all party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children and adults - said there had been a 64% rise nationally in the number of children being sent to live away between 2012 and 2017. Figures obtained by Ms Coffey from the Department for Education show the number of children placed in homes out of their borough has risen from 2,250 in 2012 to 3,680 in March 2017. 'Physical abuse' Ms Coffey said some children were being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live \"where they have no friends or family circles or local social workers\", creating a \"perfect storm where it is increasingly difficult to protect [them]\". \"Despite the [government] pledge, record numbers of children are being sent away to places where they are more vulnerable to exploitation,\" she added. \"These children are running away at a faster rate and are being targeted and preyed upon by paedophiles and criminals who know they are vulnerable.\" The MP said there had also been a huge increase in the number of sent-away children going missing, with the number of incidents more than doubling to almost 10,000 a year. Children's charity the NSPCC said going missing from care \"puts children at greater risk of physical abuse, grooming and sexual exploitation\". A Department for Education spokesman said it was updating its strategy to improve responses to missing people and strengthening its care planning and children's homes regulation to require all homes to have a \"clear policy for preventing children from going missing\". \"Local authorities have a statutory duty to make sure that placements meet the needs of children in their care and this includes ensuring children are not placed too far from home or family support networks.\" The spokesman said the government's \"ambitious\" programme of action would ensure young people were better protected and the department would \"be looking closely at","2":"The Duke of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cornwall were in Cornwall for a royal visit.

Cymdeithas yr Iaith argues that the council's plans are based on \"worn out\" arguments and that the council wants high standards and does not rush. However, the council states that it wants high standards and does not rush. A report being considered by the committee on Monday highlights the cost per pupil and a backlog of repairs at all three schools. It also mentions the lower than expected standards at Ysgol Henblas and Ysgol Bodffordd. The report recommends either building a new school to replace all three schools or building a school to replace Ysgol Bodffordd and Ysgol Corn Hir and keeping Ysgol Henblas in its current form or as a multi-site school. The committee will consider the options and make a recommendation on the future of the schools. However, the Welsh language group points to the changes in the School Organisation Code, which will mean that rural schools will be officially designated and listed, making closures the last resort. Authorities will need to evaluate the likelihood of a school's closure having an effect on the education of children, the wider community and travel arrangements and explain why a school's closure would be the \"most appropriate\" action. A consultation ended in September 2017 and the plans are currently being reviewed. Referring to this, Cymdeithas yr Iaith addressed a letter of appeal to the education minister. They said: \"We wish to bring to your attention the fact that education officials in Ynys M\u00f4n are trying to force a proposal to close the Bodffordd and Henblas schools before the new Code comes into force. \"They use the same old generic arguments that would result in the closure of every rural school on your list if dogmatically adhered to.\" In response, an Anglesey council spokesman said: \"We are aware of the possible changes to the School Organisation Code and act on the content. \"As part of this, community, language and travel considerations are key factors for all school closures and we will continue to take them into account and explain the reasons for closures.\"","4":"The article discusses the report of the venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft on boosting the economy of the UK.

The article provides details about the events leading up to the death of one of the reservists, Corporal James Dunsby. Dunsby's body temperature was recorded as 40.4 degrees Celsius, which is well above the normal body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. Dunsby died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham 17 days after the exercise. Another two of the reservists, Lance Corporals Craig Roberts and Edward Maher, died during the exercise and were transported to a nearby hospital where Maher died about three hours after the exercise. The article describes the scene of the exercise and provides details about the temperature and weather conditions at the time of the event. The article quotes a clinical team leader from the Welsh Ambulance Service who said he did not think Dunsby would survive and that he initially thought there were three people \"on the hill\" in cardiac arrest.

Unite Against Fascism (UAF) argues that Oxford Union's invitation to Marine Le Pen is equivalent to \"targeting fascists\" and that the invitation would give a prestigious platform to racists and Islamophobes, thus contributing to the rise of racism and fascism. In response, the Oxford Union President Lisa Wehden argues that the Union is a \"politically-neutral\" organization and an invitation does not necessarily endorse the agenda of the speaker. Moreover, the far-right French National Front party led by Ms. Le Pen is the third-largest party in France. In an interview, Ms. Le Pen said that the Union's invitation shows \"intellectual courage\" and she is \"prepared for a real debate\" and will not \"resort to the language of insults and violence\" as some of the Union's members had done in the past. In another interview, the Oxford Union President said the Union's invitation reflects the \"principle of freedom of speech\" and the Union encourages members who oppose the views of the speaker to attend the event and question the speaker. Mr. Tanner, a local councillor and Labour party supporter, argues that the Union's invitation is an \"irresponsible stunt\" and a \"contradiction\" of the Union's claim of \"intellectual and moral courage\" and \"democratic values\" as the Union's invitation would give a \"prestigious platform\" to fascists and racists. Mr. Tanner also points out the danger of the rise of fascism and racism and argues that the Union's invitation will \"encourage\" racists and Islamophobes and lead to the \"persecution\" of the Muslims and the \"discrimination\" of the ethnic minorities. In a statement, the Oxford Union states that the Union encourages all members who oppose the views of the speaker to attend the event and question the speaker and the Union allows members \"to meet people face-to-face and make up their own minds\" and the Union \"will not censor or suppress opinions\" and \"will defend the rights of all speakers and members of the Union to speak and hear views of","8":"11-year-old girl named Moira Anderson went missing in Scotland in 1957 after running an errand for her family during a blizzard. Despite decades of appeals and investigations, the case remained cold until 1999 when a child abuser named James Gallogley claimed that the missing girl's body was buried in an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery and that his former friend and paedophile Alexander Gartshore was the murderer. Gartshore died in 2006 and his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira's, published a book in which she accused Gartshore of the schoolgirl's murder and said he initially buried the body in a ditch before moving it to the cemetery. In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot of a former acquaintance of Gartshore's named Sinclair Upton found anomalies in the soil that were consistent with another body being buried there. In 2012, Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, granted permission for the grave of Mr Upton to be exhumed and for a DNA analysis to be conducted on the remains. Sandra Brown and Moira's sister Janet Hart launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed and a DNA analysis conducted. In September 2013, police launched an investigation into the case and were given permission to exhume the grave of Mr Upton at the cemetery. In December 2013, police revealed that a number of bones and bone fragments were found at the burial site of Mr Upton and DNA analysis of the remains will determine whether or not the bones are human and if a match can be made with the DNA of Gartshore or the remains of the missing girl. In January 2014, police announced that the bones and bone fragments were from a human body and the analysis of the DNA would determine if the remains were of Gartshore or the missing schoolgirl. In March 2014, the remains of a girl were uncovered from the grave of Mr Upton and the DNA analysis of the remains were matched to that of Gartshore. Police believe Gartshore may have moved the body of the missing girl from the ditch where he initially buried the body and dumped the remains at the cemetery","9":"The article focuses on the restoration of the interior and historic collections of a famed 18th Century mansion in County Down, Ireland. Neil Watt and Kris Reid spent most of the year restoring the mansion's interior and historic collections. With no visitors allowed for most of the year, the couple set about meticulously restoring some of the manor's interior and historic collections. Neil, the newly-appointed collections and house manager, moved into the top floor of the mansion in March and was preparing to welcome thousands to the National Trust property when coronavirus hit. With both men experienced conservationists - Neil has a PhD in Irish country houses and Kris is studying for a PhD in heritage - they instead set about giving everything from the chandeliers to the kitchen utensils a new lease of life. First there was the installation of a new dehumidifying system to address a centuries-old damp problem. Then they set about cleaning and cataloguing the house's collection of 2,000 books, most dating from the 18th Century. Castle Ward also boasts one of the finest sets of cooking pots and pans on the island of Ireland, but over the centuries it had become blackened and tarnished. The couple polished the 100 pieces one by one. They did the same with many other fixtures and fittings, including all the brass door handles. The good weather in the early summer allowed them to clean the antique window blinds and beat down the luxury carpets and rugs. There was also the delicate job of cleaning the crystal Victorian chandeliers. A new architectural story Neil, who is originally from County Tyrone, said in any other year the jobs would not have been doable. \"You only have so many hours in the day and if the house is open from 11am until 5pm you can't do all this work in front of the public, because it would detract from their experience.\" The tasks were not all practical.

Clare Milford Haven, a former social editor at Tatler magazine and a polo player, met with me in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station to talk about this most sensitive of subjects. Her eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright, and good-looking. He took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006. He was in his second year of studying Spanish and business. Described by his mother as \"a doer\", he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job. James had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood. 'Horrendous and alarming' Clare Milford Haven told me: \"I wish I'd kept him under my watchful eye. \"I couldn't force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life. \"It was the most horrendous and alarming experience. \"There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn't see it coming. Our world was turned upside down. \"You have so many questions, and you just look for answers. \"A suicide bereavement is complicated by intense feelings of guilt and shame.\" James Wentworth-Stanley sought help, in vain. He had been in contact with a GP, and a walk-in centre - which sent him to A&E two days before his suicide. His mother has harnessed her pain to help others. Clare Milford Haven helps to run the Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities (TASC). One of her goals is to set up a network of centres near hospitals. Called James' Place, these would offer urgent face-to-face support for patients who are experiencing a crisis but are not in touch with mental health services. Clare hopes the idea will be piloted in West London as well as in Brighton and Hove.

EDF Energy says this will be a \"significant piece of infrastructure\", involving tunnelling more than 3km into the Bristol Channel.

The woman had approached the police for support, and the officer took advantage of her vulnerability. The officer's actions undoubtedly eroded the woman's trust in the police, and the force has acknowledged the seriousness of the matter. The officer was suspended in 2018, and an Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation concluded in 2019 that he had a case to answer for gross misconduct. The force has also sacked another officer in 2019 for having a sexual relationship with a domestic abuse survivor.

'Physical abuse' Ms Coffey said some children were being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live \"where they have no friends or family circles or local social workers\", creating a \"perfect storm where it is increasingly difficult to protect [them]\". \"Despite the [government] pledge, record numbers of children are being sent away to places where they are more vulnerable to exploitation,\" she added. \"These children are running away at a faster rate and are being targeted and preyed upon by paedophiles and criminals who know they are vulnerable.\" The MP said there had also been a huge increase in the number of sent-away children going missing, with the number of incidents more than doubling to almost 10,000 a year. Children's charity the NSPCC said going missing from care \"puts children at greater risk of physical abuse, grooming and sexual exploitation\". A Department for Education spokesman said it was updating its strategy to improve responses to missing people and strengthening its care planning and children's homes regulation to require all homes to have a \"clear policy for preventing children from going missing\". \"Local authorities have a statutory duty to make sure that placements meet the needs of children in their care and this includes \n\nSummary:","2":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The first stop on the couple's visit was the official opening of the \u00a335m Heartlands mining history and cultural attraction in Pool. They will also attend a garden party at Trewithen, near Truro. The couple sheltered under umbrellas as they officially opened the Heartlands, a community-led regeneration project in one of the most impoverished parts of Cornwall. Surfing Queen The visit to the project, at the Robinson's Shaft of the former South Crofty mine in Pool, is one of a series of engagements the couple will undertake over three days. The tour is Charles and Camilla's seventh joint annual summer visit to Cornwall. The prince, in a grey double breasted suit, lilac shirt and dark blue tie, stopped for a pint of Betty Stogs ale - produced by local brewers, Skinners. Steve Skinner, chief executive and head taster at the brewery, said: \"He said it was very nice and agreed it was very hoppy.\" The prince was also shown a beer mat produced to mark the company's launch of a specially brewed ale for the Diamond Jubilee. Scilly trip The beer mat shows the Queen surfing on a surfboard in her crown and pink robe - over a wetsuit - and with a corgi by her side. Mr Skinner said: \"\"He said she looked very pleased with herself, but the corgi looked a bit uninterested.\" On Tuesday, they will be on the Isles of Scilly and tour the new \u00a314m Five Islands school on St Mary's.

Cymdeithas yr Iaith said the council's plans were based on \"tired\" arguments. The council said it wanted high standards and denied it was in a hurry. A report being considered by the committee on Monday highlights the cost per pupil and a backlog of maintenance at all three schools. It also references lower than expected standards at Ysgol Henblas and Ysgol Bodffordd. The report recommends either building a new school to replace all three or building a school to replace Ysgol Bodffordd and Ysgol Corn Hir and maintaining Ysgol Henblas either in its current form or as a multi-site school. The committee will consider the options and make a recommendation on the future of the schools. However, the Welsh language group pointed to changes to the School Organisation Code that will mean rural schools will be officially designated and listed, making closures the last resort. Authorities will have to assess the likely impact of a school's closure on children's education, the wider community and travel arrangements, and explain why closure is the \"most appropriate\" course of action. A consultation closed in September 2017 and plans are currently being reviewed. Referring to this, Cymdeithas yr Iaith made an appeal to Education Secretary Kirsty Williams. It said: \"We wish to draw your attention to the fact that education officers in Ynys M\u00f4n (Anglesey) are attempting to rush through a proposal to close the schools at Bodffordd and Henblas... before your new code comes into force. \"They are using the same tired old generic arguments which would result in the closure of practically every rural school on your list if dogmatically adhered to.\" 'Committed' In response, an Anglesey council spokesman said: \"We are aware of the possible changes to the School Organisation Code and act on the content. \"As part of this, community, language \n\nSummary:","4":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

At a noisy prime minister's questions, Mr Miliband said the report showed the \"nasty party is back\". Mr Cameron accused Mr Miliband of being \"in the pocket of the trade unions\". The Beecroft report suggested \"some people will be dismissed simply because their employer doesn't like them\" but that was a \"price worth paying\", Mr Miliband told MPs. He asked Mr Cameron: \"Are you really telling us that, with record numbers out of work, sacking people for no good reason is a price worth paying?\" Mr Cameron said unemployment was falling, inflation was coming down and the government had cut the deficit by 25%. 'Supporting business' He told the Labour leader: \"We are taking all of these steps which have led to the greatest number of small business start-ups last year in the country's history. \"Of course, you cannot support any changes to employment regulation because you are in the pocket of the trade unions.\" The prime minister said the Beecroft report contained excellent ideas but the government was consulting on the idea of no-fault dismissal only for \"micro-businesses\". Mr Beecroft earlier hit back at Business Secretary Vince Cable who had dismissed his proposals to make it easier to fire workers as \"nonsense\". The Conservative donor told the Daily Telegraph Mr Cable's objections to his suggestions, published in a report this week, were \"ideological not economic\" and he accused Mr Cable of being a \"socialist\" who had done very little to support business. No 10 said it was doing everything possible to support business. Downing Street said \"some of (Mr Beecroft's recommendations) are being taken forward and some are not\".

L\/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, died at the scene and L\/Cpl Edward Maher died about three hours later at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The hearing has previously been told the exercise took place on one of the hottest days of the year, with temperatures expected to hit 27C (80.6F). In a statement on the seventh day of the hearing, Welsh Ambulance clinical team leader Damon James said he did not think L\/Cpl Dunsby would survive. He said he was initially told on arrival there were three people \"on the hill\" in cardiac arrest. Mr James added he was approached by an Army officer who told him he was in charge. Mr James said: \"He told me the male (Cpl Dunsby) had been on a four-day exercise and was half-an-hour from the finish. \"He said the male had collapsed about 100 yards up the track.

The company's chief executive said the jobs would be created as part of a five to six-year expansion plan. The money will be used to build a second factory and car assembly line at the site for a new car range. Dany Bahar, Group Lotus chief executive, said he was \"very, very delighted\" with the news. He said: \"It was always our intention from the beginning to create jobs in the region, especially in the automotive manufacturing industry in the UK, which was an issue. \"I believe it took a bit of time for the government to understand our plans going forward and the desire to keep the production for such a small car company together. \"It would not have made too much sense to have the mid-engined cars produced here at Hethel and different engined cars somewhere else.\" 'Complete remake' Mr Bahar added that that despite the worldwide economic problems, he believed there was still a strong market for sportcars and that would continue. Last year, Lotus unveiled five new cars at the Paris motor show, in what Mr Bahar hailed a \"complete remake of the brand\". With the government funding confirmed, the company said it would expect to see its first new car roll off the production line by 2013.

The family of Sinclair Upton, who was buried there in 1957, have consented to their plot being excavated. For relatives of Alexander Gartshore, the search may confirm whether the child rapist committed another heinous crime. Moira's tortured family have not known what happened to her since she left her family home in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957. The 11-year-old, who was five weeks short of her 12th birthday, was running an errand for her family to a nearby Co-op store when she vanished during a blizzard. She was last seen on board a bus driven by Gartshore, who was jailed later that year for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. Despite decades of appeals, the schoolgirl was never traced. The case remained cold until 1999, when child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as the murderer. Gallogley was said to have made the confession to another inmate while he was dying in Peterhead Prison. Father accused After Gartshore's death in 2006, his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira, published a book in which she accused her late father of the schoolgirl's murder. She said she believed Gartshore had initially buried the child's body in a ditch but later moved it to an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery. Mrs Brown, who later received an OBE for services to child protection and set up the Moira Anderson Foundation, believes her friend's body lies in the burial plot of Sinclair Upton, a former acquaintance of Gartshore. The paedophile is later said to have remarked that Mr Sinclair \"done him a favour\". In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot found anomalies in the soil that would be consistent with another body being buried there. Mrs Brown and Moira's sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, then launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed.

Neil Watt and Kris Reid spent most of 2020 in Castle Ward, the famed 18th Century mansion in County Down. With no visitors allowed for most of the year, they set to work meticulously restoring some of the manor's interior and historic collections. Neil, the newly-appointed collections and house manager, moved into the top floor of the mansion in March and was preparing to welcome thousands to the National Trust property when coronavirus hit. With both men experienced conservationists - Neil has a PhD in Irish country houses and Kris is studying for a PhD in heritage - they instead set about giving everything from the chandeliers to the kitchen utensils a new lease of life. First there was the installation of a new dehumidifying system to address a centuries-old damp problem. Then they set about cleaning and cataloguing the house's collection of 2,000 books, most dating from the 18th Century. Castle Ward also boasts one of the finest sets of cooking pots and pans on the island of Ireland, but over the centuries it had become blackened and tarnished. The couple polished the 100 pieces one by one. They did the same with many other fixtures and fittings, including all the brass door handles. The good weather in the early summer allowed them to clean the antique window blinds and beat down the luxury carpets and rugs. There was also the delicate job of cleaning the crystal Victorian chandeliers. A new architectural story Neil, who is originally from County Tyrone, said in any other year the jobs would not have been doable. \"You only have so many hours in the day and if the house is open from 11am until 5pm you can't do all this work in front of the public, because it would detract from their experience.\" The tasks were not all practical.

To talk about this most sensitive of subjects, I met a polo player and former social editor at Tatler magazine, Clare Milford Haven, for a coffee in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station. Her eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright and good-looking. He took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006. He was in his second year of studying Spanish and business. Described by his mother as \"a doer\", he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job. James had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood. 'Horrendous and alarming' Clare Milford Haven told me: \"I wish I'd kept him under my watchful eye. \"I couldn't force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life. \"It was the most horrendous and alarming experience. \"There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn't see it coming. Our world was turned upside down. \"You have so many questions, and you just look for answers. \"A suicide bereavement is complicated by intense feelings of guilt and shame.\" James Wentworth-Stanley sought help, in vain. He had been in contact with a GP, and a walk-in centre - which sent him to A&E two days before his suicide. His mother has harnessed her pain to help others. Clare Milford Haven helps to run the Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities (TASC). One of her goals is to set up a network of centres near hospitals. Called James' Place, these would offer urgent face-to-face support for patients who are experiencing a crisis but are not in touch with mental health services.

And he welcomed the two investigations being carried out into the incident. John Yuill and Lamara Bell were found inside the crashed car last Wednesday, three days after it had been reported. Mr Yuill, 28, is thought to have died on impact after the Renault Clio left the M9 and went down an embankment on the outskirts of Stirling. Ms Bell, 25, was critically injured and died in hospital at the weekend after suffering broken bones and kidney damage which was caused by dehydration after she spent three days trapped next to the body of her boyfriend. A local man told the BBC he called the police non-emergency 101 number at 11:30 on Sunday 5 July and was told officers would investigate. Sir Stephen has admitted that the initial information received about the crash was not entered into police systems. It was only when a second call was made by someone else three days later that the car, which had gone down an embankment off the M9 near Stirling, was investigated. Opposition politicians have called on Sir Stephen to consider his position, but he has been given the backing of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Secretary Michael Matheson. Ms Sturgeon has said there was nothing to suggest the force's handling of the fatal crash had been due to any \"wider systemic issue\". In an interview with BBC Scotland, Sir Stephen acknowledged that the deaths of Mr Yuill and Ms Bell were \"a tragic situation\" where \"we've got things badly wrong\".

Now the environment watchdog Natural Resources Wales (NRW) says it has received another application. EDF Energy wants to deposit up to 780,000 tonnes of sediment dredged as part of building work for the Hinkley Point C plant. The developers have submitted a plan to NRW for sampling and testing the mud, which will now be subject to a six-week consultation with specialists and the public. NRW's role is to determine whether the material is suitable for disposal at Cardiff Grounds, a licensed dumping ground for dredged sediment around two and a half miles out to sea from the Welsh capital Michael Evans, the regulator's head of evidence, knowledge and advice said \"the first step of a long application process\" was to assess the sampling plan, before the developers request a marine licence to carry out the work. \"The disposal activity in 2018 caused great public concern, so we intend to inform and engage with people about these plans over the next few months,\" he explained. \"We will only grant the licence if the company can demonstrate it complies with legal requirements and we're confident the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.\" As well as a marine licence from NRW to deposit the mud in Welsh waters, EDF Energy will also need another from England's Marine Management Organisation in order to dredge off the Somerset coast. They hope to start carrying out the work in early 2021. Why is the mud dumping so controversial? The seabed alongside Hinkley Point C - which is being built near Bridgwater - is being dredged so that the \u00a321.5-22.5bn power station's water cooling system can be installed.

Several people who've contacted me after comparatively mild illness have spoken of the lingering cognitive impact of the disease - problems with their memory, tiredness, staying focused. But it's at the more severe end that there is most concern. Chatting to Paul Mylrea, it's hard to imagine that he had two massive strokes, both caused by coronavirus infection. The 64-year-old, who is director of communications at Cambridge University, is eloquent and, despite some lingering weakness on his right side, able-bodied. He has made one of the most remarkable recoveries ever seen by doctors at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN) in London. His first stroke happened while he was in intensive care at University College Hospital. Potentially deadly blood clots were also found in his lungs and legs, so he was put on powerful blood-thinning (anticoagulant) drugs. A couple of days later he suffered a second, even bigger stroke and was immediately transferred to the NHNN in Queen Square. Consultant neurologist Dr Arvind Chandratheva was just leaving hospital when the ambulance arrived. \"Paul had a blank expression on his face,\" he says. \"He could only see on one side and he couldn't figure out how to use his phone or remember his passcode. \"I immediately thought that the blood thinners had caused a bleed in the brain, but what we saw was so strange and different.\" Paul had suffered another acute stroke due to a clot, depriving vital areas of the brain of blood supply. Tests showed that he had astonishingly high levels of a marker for the amount of clotting in the blood known as D-dimer. Normally these are less than 300, and in stroke patients can rise to 1,000.

A senior officer described his actions as having \"undoubtedly eroded\" the victim's trust in police. On 5 November a Devon and Cornwall Police disciplinary hearing concluded the officer \"used that person's personal contact information in order to pursue a personal relationship\". Police said the officer \"exchanged a considerable number of sexually explicit messages\" while on duty , and did not properly update the victim on the status of the criminal investigation. The officer was first suspended in November 2018. 'Abuse of position' An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation concluded in May 2019 the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct.

Agents selling the land said it could be developed for wind farms due to its elevation. But the Open Spaces Society said it was dismayed over the suggestion. Common land, which covers 432,434 acres (175,000 hectares) of land across Wales, often dates back to medieval times. The Epynt Commons is owned by Tredegar Estate and is subject to grazing and access rights, but can be sold just like any other land, says the selling agent. Nearly 230 people graze sheep, ponies and horses on the four commons, and this is only the third time in 300 years they have been placed on the market. Chester Master Property Consultants said they had potential for wind farm development, subject to planning permission, due to their elevation and the high wind speeds in the area. The firm said the commons could also interest nature conservationists, local farmers and those with a sporting interests. But Kate Ashbrook of the Open Spaces Society said it would be difficult to build wind farms on the land. \"I am dismayed that these lovely commons should be up for sale with the stated aim of wind farm development,\" she said. \"Whoever buys them, because it's registered common land, would find in difficult to get (building) consent.

But the sci-fi, starring Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey, took first place in the global box office rundown. Ouija and Nightcrawler, last week's joint number one, fell to four and six. It is only the fourth time in US box office history that two films have opened with $50m or above, according to experts Rentrak. Senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that Big Hero 6 and Interstellar \"were both able to do well without cannibalising each other's audiences\". \"It's a perfect example of counterprogramming. It paid off for the industry, and it just doesn't happen that often,\" he added. Despite that, Mr Dergarabedian said the US box office had slipped 7% compared to the same weekend last year.

Outstanding \"The new jobs will offer an average salary of \u00a333,000, providing excellent opportunities for graduate and experienced IT professionals as well as school leavers.\" Invest Northern Ireland has offered Tullett Prebon over \u00a32m towards the creation of the new jobs with the Department for the Economy Assured Skills programme providing \u00a3400k for associated training. Analysis: BBC NI business correspondent Julian O'Neill The announcement of 300 jobs is the largest the Northern Ireland executive has been able to unveil in ten months. It continues Belfast's track record of attracting well paid jobs in the financial services sector. Negotiations about the jobs took a year to conclude and were set in motion long before the EU referendum, the outcome of which did not torpedo an important inward investment. The executive and Invest NI are very keen to project a business-as-usual message and this announcement aids that narrative.
