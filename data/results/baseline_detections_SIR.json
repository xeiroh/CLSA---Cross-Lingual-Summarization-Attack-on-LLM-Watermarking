In a brief message, the president said \"there is no cause for worry\". Mr Buhari, 74, has left Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo in charge, just as he did when he left for London in January for seven weeks of medical leave. Mr Osinbajo was widely praised at the time for his performance as acting president. The exact length of the president's stay in London \"will be determined by the doctors\", a statement from the presidency said. But, it added, \"government will continue to function normally under the able leadership of the vice-president\". His last official act before leaving for London was to meet the 82 schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok in 2014 after they were released by Boko Haram Islamist militants. The girls were handed over on Saturday in exchange for five Boko Haram suspects after negotiations, sources have told the BBC. A list of the girls' names has been published, but it is not clear if all the parents have been formally notified, whether or not their girls are among those released. They were from a group of 276 abducted from their school in north-eastern Nigeria. About 113 of the girls are still missing, along with hundreds of other people kidnapped by the militant group. Nigerians are particularly sensitive to the health of their president after then President Umaru Yar'Adua sought medical treatment in Saudi Arabia in 2009. His failure to hand power to the vice-president and the lack of information about his condition led to widespread anxiety. He died in office in 2010. When Mr Buhari returned from London in March, he said he had never felt \"so sick\" as he had when he was being treated and warned that he may have to undergo further medical checks. Concerns over his health were rekindled after he missed the last three cabinet meetings, prompting civil society activists to urge him to return to London for further treatment - advice which he did not heed.\n\nWord Count: 193</s>",

The Roseacre Awareness Group (RAG) was making its final speech at the inquiry. Cuadrilla is due to make its closing statement later. RAG spokesperson Elizabeth Warner said the group, which represents some residents from Rosacre Wood, was concerned about increased traffic, the effect on the landscape and damage to health and well being. Consequences Local roads were not designed to cope with 44 tonne lorries, she said. \"Tranquil fields\" would be turned into a \"lit industrial installation,\" she warned. Cuadrilla Chief Executive Francis Egan said the council had gone against the advice of its own planning officials over the Preston New Road application and had ignored its own legal advice. He said because of this, the company would apply for costs if it won the appeal on the grounds the council was unreasonable. Mr Egan added: \"I think it is perfectly reasonable that there should be consequences for the council's decision.\" Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - was suspended in the UK in 2011 following earth tremors in Blackpool, where Cuadrilla previously drilled. Lancashire County Council rejected both of Cuadrilla's planning applications last year on the grounds of noise and traffic impact. The energy firm disputed those reasons at the appeal hearing and said night-time noise would be short and affect only a handful of homes. At Roseacre, the traffic would be a maximum of 50 HGV movements a day for 12 weeks, Nathalie Lieven QC, representing Cuadrilla, told the public inquiry. Analysis: Judy Hobson, Environment Correspondent, BBC North West Tonight. The fracking inquiry is drawing to a close but a final decision is still weeks away. Planning Inspector Wendy MacKay has listened to five weeks of speeches and arguments, sometimes emotional and passionate. Whatever her recommendation, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid will have the final say. Cuardrilla has already told the government it wants to appeal if a planning consent isn't forthcoming.\n\nWhat is the most important issue in the article?
