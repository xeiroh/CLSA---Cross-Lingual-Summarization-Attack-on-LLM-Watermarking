Despite decades of appeals and investigations, the case remained cold until 1999 when a child abuser named James Gallogley claimed that the missing girl's body was buried in an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery and that his former friend and paedophile Alexander Gartshore was the murderer. Gartshore died in 2006 and his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira's, published a book in which she accused Gartshore of the schoolgirl's murder and said he initially buried the body in a ditch before moving it to the cemetery. In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot of a former acquaintance of Gartshore's named Sinclair Upton found anomalies in the soil that were consistent with another body being buried there. In 2012, Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, granted permission for the grave of Mr Upton to be exhumed and for a DNA analysis to be conducted on the remains. Sandra Brown and Moira's sister Janet Hart launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed and a DNA analysis conducted. In September 2013, police launched an investigation into the case and were given permission to exhume the grave of Mr Upton at the cemetery. In December 2013, police revealed that a number of bones and bone fragments were found at the burial site of Mr Upton and DNA analysis of the remains will determine whether or not the bones are human and if a match can be made with the DNA of Gartshore or the remains of the missing girl. In January 2014, police announced that the bones and bone fragments were from a human body and the analysis of the DNA would determine if the remains were of Gartshore or the missing schoolgirl. In March 2014, the remains of a girl were uncovered from the grave of Mr Upton and the DNA analysis of the remains were matched to that of Gartshore.

Moira's tortured family have not known what happened to her since she left her family home in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957. The 11-year-old, who was five weeks short of her 12th birthday, was running an errand for her family to a nearby Co-op store when she vanished during a blizzard. She was last seen on board a bus driven by Gartshore, who was jailed later that year for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. Despite decades of appeals, the schoolgirl was never traced. The case remained cold until 1999, when child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as the murderer. Gallogley was said to have made the confession to another inmate while he was dying in Peterhead Prison. Father accused After Gartshore's death in 2006, his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira, published a book in which she accused her late father of the schoolgirl's murder.

The remote mountainous territory is an autonomous region ruled by Beijing. In their lawsuit against Hu Jintao the Madrid-based Tibetan Support Committee allege that as Communist leader in the region he was ultimately responsible for actions \"aimed at eliminating the uniqueness and existence of Tibet as a country, imposing martial law, carrying out forced deportations, mass sterilisation campaigns, torture of dissidents\". The Spanish legal system recognises the universal justice principle, under which genocide suspects can be put on trial outside their home country. But for Spain to hold the trial there is a requirement that at least one victim of alleged genocide must be a Spanish citizen. Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over Tibet, but many Tibetans remain loyal to the exiled Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. He is seen by his followers as a living god, but by China as a separatist threat.

They hope to launch the new Funeral Expense Assistance benefit by the summer of 2019. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said she was taking \"decisive action\" over what was a \"growing issue\". The cost of burials and cremations has been on the rise, studies have shown. In 2016 a basic burial, on average, cost more than \u00a31,300, excluding undertakers fees, while the average local authority cremation cost \u00a3670. A 2016 study by the Stirling Citizens Advice bureau found there had been a steep rise in so-called \"paupers' funerals\", which cost local authorities \u00a3500,000 in the previous year. The new benefit is part of a 10-point plan which commits the government to a range of actions over funeral costs. It includes a range of advice services, including guidance on funeral costs, consumer protection in relation to funeral plans, a Social Innovation Fund to tackle funeral poverty and the pilot of a \"funeral bond\" to help people save up for their own burial. 'Increased difficulties' Ms Constance said the government was committed to \"supporting those who need it most following a bereavement\". She said: \"The death of a loved one is an incredibly difficult time for anyone. It can be even harder when money is tight. We know funeral costs can push people into poverty - and often it is those already in financial hardship who face increased difficulties. \"That is why we are taking decisive action to tackle this growing issue and have engaged with local authorities, the funeral sector and other support services. I am pleased by the willingness to work together to find solutions that support more affordable funerals.\" The Scottish government held a national conference on funeral poverty in November 2016, and has hosted a series of round-table discussions on the issue.

Pangolins sell for hundreds of dollars per kilogram in China and are protected in many Asian countries. The 12 Chinese fishermen, currently detained on Palawan island, could be fined or jailed if they are found guilty of poaching. They also face attempted bribery charges. More charges may be brought following the discovery of the pangolins. The boat is the seventh Chinese fishing vessel caught in the area since 2002, according to a statement from Tubbataha Reefs National Park. The USS Guardian also struck the reef south-east of Palawan island on 17 January. The ship was dismantled to minimise damage to the reef and the US has apologised for the accident. Four navy officers on the minesweeper were relieved of their duties. The Philippines and China have territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and engaged in a lengthy stand-off over the Scarborough shoal last year.

In fact this latest news allows Brazilians a moment of indulgence despite what was actually a year of quite sluggish growth. In 2011, the country's economy grew by 2.7%, a big drop from the 7.5% growth seen the previous year. Despite its good fortune, Brazil has not entirely escaped the impact of the financial crisis. However, even with the lower-than-expected result, the old tag of \"country of the future - and always will be\" is starting to sound less of a joke and more like a promise being fulfilled. In the last 10 years, Brazil consolidated its role as an agricultural superpower, discovered massive oil reserves in the Atlantic, paid its debts to the International Monetary Fund and developed a more assertive diplomacy. With a newly-found confidence, it started to break through the stereotypical image when it was often seen by others as only being the land of football and samba. It also saw the rise of a new middle class, whose purchasing power has been fuelling Brazil's continuous economic growth amid declining industrial output and weak global economic activity. A combination of economic success and government measures to distribute income has helped lift millions out of poverty, although Brazil remains a very unequal country. Low unemployment combined with wage increases and a boom in credit has helped to fuel this consumption.

Its founder Kelly Morellon worked with her mother Sylvie to devise a design that covers the nose but makes the mouth visible, and can be washed at a high temperature to reduce infection. \"The basic aim of these transparent masks is to allow deaf and hearing impaired people to read the lips of someone speaking to them,\" Kelly told the BBC. \"But they are also very useful for autistic people, people with learning difficulties and small children who might be scared of masks or need to be able to see facial expressions. \"In any case, a transparent mask allows you to see each other's smiles, and at this sad time this could not be more important.\" Unlike some companies around the world - in Scotland, the US and Indonesia, for instance - Kelly and her mother are not able to produce their masks on a commercial basis.

Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nBy Genevieve HassanEntertainment reporter, BBC News Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch stars in the drama about the British code breaker who helped decrypt the Enigma machine during World War Two. In a message, director Morten Tyldum said it was \"an amazing honour\" to win the prize. \"For film fans to support the Imitation Game means so much to me, the entire cast and film-making team,\" he said. Turing was credited with bringing about the end of the war and saving hundreds of thousands of lives after decoding German Naval messages. He is also considered to be the founding father of the modern-day computer. However his later life was overshadowed after a conviction in 1952 for gross indecency when homosexuality was illegal in Britain. He was chemically castrated and committed suicide in 1954. Earlier this week Tyldum described the film as \"a tribute to being different\". Winners of the People's Choice award - voted for by the public - have previously gone on to win the Oscar for best picture, including The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire and last year's 12 Years a Slave. The Imitation Game's victory suggests it may feature prominently in this coming awards' season. Sir Ben Kingsley's romantic comedy Learning to Drive, in which the actor stars as a Sikh taxi driver and driving instructor alongside Patricia Clarkson, was named first runner-up for the top prize. Comedy drama St Vincent, starring Bill Murray as a cantankerous war veteran who finds himself having to look after his neighbour's young son, was the second runner-up. The People's Choice documentary award went to Hajooj Kuka's Beats of the Antonov which follows the story of Sudanese cattle farmers. Do I Sound Gay?, directed by US journalist and film-maker David Thorpe, was the first runner-up with Ethan Hawke's musical documentary, Seymour: An Introduction, the second runner-up.

There is no maximum speed limit in the Isle of Man, although there have been a number of failed attempts to introduce one over the years. The spokesman said: \"We do expect riders to use their common sense and clearly if they can't see what's coming towards them then they shouldn't be travelling at 140 mph.\" The latest victim's next of kin are being sought by police before his details can be released.

LTNs were introduced by some councils as a way to reduce car ownership and increase cycling and walking, while congestion levels have reached pre-lockdown levels and are expected to exceed them in the near future. While the schemes have received both support and opposition from residents, they have sparked a debate over the effectiveness of LTNs in reducing congestion and improving air quality. One of the key issues with LTNs is the lack of consultation with residents before their implementation, as some were put in place without warning, leading to frustration and anger among local communities. Despite the controversy surrounding LTNs, some residents support them as a way to reduce car ownership and improve air quality. However, the debate around LTNs highlights the need for better consultation and a more balanced approach when implementing transport schemes in local communities. Overall, the article provides an insight into the debate around LTNs and the implications for local communities and transport policy in London and beyond.\n\nMake sure the article you choose can be read for free- some sites need subscriptions and I can't post the article without a citation and link back to the original article...\n\n(The article must be at least one year old)\n\n##### Do you need a similar assignment done for you from scratch?

But the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) are attracting loud noisy opposition in most places they are put in. LTNs use planters to stop through traffic but they also mean getting around in places like Northfields in Ealing by car becomes a lot more difficult. And that is the theory behind them - they want to drive down car ownership and get people to switch to cycling and walking. It is important to state they also get strong support. And with congestion levels almost near pre-lockdown levels and looking to the surpass them, some councils think LTNs are the answer to create low traffic corridors. There is also, I suspect, a silent majority and it is very difficult to gauge what the majority want. Many, I think, are waiting to see how the six-month trials work out. One thing is certain, these schemes have split communities. When you are out filming LTNs it takes minutes before people are telling you about how they hate them. Moments later a family will pass and say: \"Keep the LTNs.\" It is rare for transport schemes to attract that instant response and in Northfields in west London when I was there, that is all everyone was talking about. In the middle are the councils which designed them, funded by money from central government. Crucially for boroughs, there was a set time limit to apply for the funding and controversially the schemes use emergency traffic orders. The consultation happens over the first six months of operation. Some of the planters were put in overnight with no warning. That type of ongoing consultation has angered many. And now local politics seems to be coming into play. If there was ever a quick U-turn, then the Conservative council of Wandsworth did it last week by scrapping their LTNs. It will be interesting to see if scrapping LTNs improves congestion in the borough. And Conservative council\n\nSummary:",

The 41st test took place over Mururoa Atoll on 17 July 1974, when the atomic cloud took a different trajectory than planned.

The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. People are advised not to try this without medical advice. In the experiments, mice were put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". It is like the human form of the diet when people spend five days on a low-calorie, low-protein, low-carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. Diabetes therapy? But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects.

It has proved a promising market for many dog-loving entrepreneurs, who have turned their dreams of canine sushi, neckties and four-poster beds into family-run British businesses. One in four UK households own a dog, adding up to 8.5 million mutts in homes across the country. So there is no shortage of potential customers for even the most unusual pet paraphernalia, some of which is on display in the vast halls of Birmingham's NEC at the Kennel Club's annual dog show - Crufts. Dog tired Courtney Gilbert admits that a four-poster bed for a dog is an \"extravagant touch\". Still in prototype form, the 25-year-old expects to start selling the bed to order for a minimum of \u00a3395. Options include matching the feather and down cushions to the colour of the owner's curtains, and adding a ladder to the side of the bed so a second dog can snuggle down on the top. Miss Gilbert, who is based near Coventry, says the inspiration for the luxury pet bed business came while bored during the holidays as she studied for a fashion degree. Her mum challenged her to design a bed for the family dog. She embellished a bedroom drawer. It proved to be a light bulb moment, as she went on to establish Cosy Chic Pet Boutique during her spare time while still at university. Dog's dinner Dogs love to be rewarded. Suzanne Rothman says they love to be rewarded with sushi. The training treats are half chicken, half fish and used to ensure the animal's full attention during agility and obedience sessions.

Twelve points usually means a temporary driving ban unless it can be proved it would cause exceptional hardship.

A Freedom of Information request to the DVLA showed 579 drivers in Wales with 12 penalty points or more, as of 2 April this year.

Andrew Howard, head of road safety for the AA, said he understood why magistrates had discretion over disqualifications, but added that repeat offending should not be tolerated just because somebody's livelihood relied on being able to drive. \"You can't see why these people are repeatedly doing it - you should be able to see it coming,\" he said. \"The idea is that people get warned for this along the way and see their points totting up.

Officials say they are better prepared than in 1999 when a cyclone killed thousands of people in Orissa. Cyclone Phailin has been classed as \"very severe\", and the head of India's Meteorological Office, LS Rathore, said it would remain in that category for six hours before losing strength. The eye of the storm was moving at 10-15 km/h (6-9mph), he said. The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder reported heavy rain and high winds lashing Gopalpur as the cyclone made landfall. 'Apocalyptic devastation' The storm has ripped up trees and road signs, and cut power supplies in some areas. There were reports of window panes being shattered and roofs being blown off. Five deaths were linked to the cyclone by Indian media, four attributed to falling trees and one to a house collapse. Another BBC reporter, Andrew North, spoke of a scene of apocalyptic devastation in Brahmapur, just inland from where the cyclone reached the coast. Store signs and other debris were being pitched high in the air by storm gusts and elaborate decorations for a major Hindu festival were strewn over the main road. Officials had earlier said that no-one would be allowed to stay in mud and thatched houses along the coast of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, but some residents said they wanted to stay put. \"Many people refused to move, had to be convinced, and at times the police had to forcefully move them to safe places,\" said Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde.

In late March 2021, Nasa's core stage for the SLS was fully loaded with propellant for the first time at the Nasa's Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis in Mississippi. This was part of a testing programme known as the Green Run, which involves eight tests on the core stage. In the latest test, known as the wet dress rehearsal (WDR), the core stage was loaded with liquid hydrogen and oxygen for the first time, and the propellant was controlled and drained.

That propellant is fuel and an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. Engineers wanted to check things worked as expected before the SLS makes its maiden flight in about a year's time. It was part of a testing programme known as the Green Run, that is being carried out at Nasa's Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis in Mississippi. This evaluation, known as the wet dress rehearsal (WDR), was the seventh of eight tests on the core stage. Nasa said the rocket responded well to the propellant being loaded. But the test experienced an unexpected shutdown a few minutes earlier than was planned. However, the completion of the WDR should set up the eighth and final test - a \"hotfire\" - where all four RS-25 engines at the base of the core will be fired together for the first time.

As one former minister put it \"I don't want him anywhere near my seat - they should continue to send him to places we won't win\". A senior Labour figure described the party's local election performance as \"calamitous\". So much so that some of Mr Corbyn's supporters fear another attempted putsch by his internal opponents. That doesn't seem likely, though. John Curtice: Six key lessons for the general election That's because many of those who are sceptical about his leadership say there is no obvious mechanism to remove him - and he would use any evidence of a plot to excuse a bad general election result. Time and again the phrase they use is that those around Jeremy Corbyn must \"own\" any defeat. The former Labour group leader in Derbyshire, Dave Wilcox, saw control of his council pass to the Conservatives today. He told the BBC he wouldn't be calling for Jeremy Corbyn's resignation right now - but if Labour were to suffer a similar defeat nationally on 8 June, the party leader should go. He told me: \"Genuine Labour supporters have been saying we can't vote for this bloke because he doesn't speak for me. \"We heard it time and time and time again on the doorstep. We are not voting for you while you have Jeremy Corbyn as leader.\" The party's mayoral candidate in the West Midlands, Sion Simon - close to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson - chose to focus not on the party leader to explain his defeat.

He'd talk about whether I cycled anywhere and said 'You'd look good in Lycra'. \"He added me on Facebook and would ask me questions about whether I was single. As soon as I ended the lessons, I had a text from him asking me out for a drink.\" Jess (not her real name) says this left her \"mortified\" as she thought she was way too young for him. The changes were brought in after MP Richard Graham asked the Prime Minister Theresa May to look into the issue. He said the law should be changed to protect young drivers from \"being groomed by a predatory instructor\" and that instructors should be \"covered by the same rules as teachers\". In 2001, the law was changed to make it illegal for teachers to engage in sexual activity with pupils at their school, if they were aged under 18.

Whitehall wants to give firms the right to drill at depths of 300m (984ft) under private land without consent. This is despite opposition to the proposals in a government consultation. A UK government spokesman said: \"The Scottish Government statement ignores the fact most of the powers needed to make Scottish decisions on this matter are already devolved to Holyrood.\" The spokesman claimed local communities in Scotland had full powers to decide whether to approve or decline any proposed shale or geothermal developments. However, Scotland's energy minister said: \"UK government proposals to remove the right of Scottish householders to object to drilling under their homes, without so much as debate in the Scottish Parliament, flies in the face of Scotland's cautious, considered and evidence-based approach on this issue.\" \"It is also fundamentally an issue affecting land ownership rights. \"Whatever your view on the issue of unconventional oil and gas - and it is clear that there are both opportunities and concerns - there is only one way that the people of Scotland can determine the approach in Scotland - including beneath their homes and land. \"That is with the devolution of the necessary powers to Scotland and the current devolution process for the extensive new powers promised in the vow should include these powers.\" Hydraulic fracturing or fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it.

Inadequate staffing levels and a lack of resources contributed to the death of the young inmate, leading to an ongoing investigation at the Coroner's Court in Milton Keynes. At the time of the incident, Ms. Rance's healthcare team consisted of one full-time nurse, another part-time nurse, a psychiatrist for a portion of the week, and herself, leaving them unable to manage the sheer volume of patients effectively. Furthermore, the jury at the inquest heard evidence suggesting that the staff's failure to attend to the young man's well-being contributed to his tragic demise. During his time at the correctional facility, Mr. Harvey had a history of substance abuse and suffered from a learning disability. Despite the severity of his condition and his classification as a vulnerable adult, he did not receive a crucial mental health assessment, despite Ms. Rance's repeated requests for one. In a shocking revelation, the jury also heard that the young man's cell was not checked as frequently as necessary due to threats he posed to the staff. Despite the frequency of his observations every 30 minutes, the staff still did not enter his cell as he threatened to throw a television at anyone entering the room.

The comments were in answer to a question from Det Supt Andy Street from Bedfordshire Police, who asked: \"When will the Acpo (Association of Chief Police Officers) ranks take their share of reduction in numbers being experienced by superintendents and all other ranks?\" Ms Owens said that restructuring the police force would lead to a reduction in chief constables, deputy chief constables, and assistant chief constables.

'Collaborative arrangements' \"We don't currently have that so we're having to come to collaborative arrangements - I speak on behalf of my own force,\" she said. \"We currently share an assistant chief constable position with Sussex and that does actually come with its own challenges, regardless of the skill of the individual.\" She said she thought there would not be mergers and that it was more likely that under the new police crime commissioners, who are due to be elected in November, there would be more collaboration with neighbouring forces. In August 2011 a joint major crime investigation team, made up of officers from the Surrey and Sussex forces, was created.

Other reforms include introducing \"international\" languages in primaries. The Welsh Government said it was working to ensure teachers had the right skills. This included providing intensive Welsh-language training to teachers and teaching assistants through a sabbatical scheme. Analysis By BBC Wales education correspondent Bethan Lewis This responds to long-standing calls for Welsh as a \"second language\" to be ditched. Most agree it has been ineffective in giving young people who do not speak the language at home the skills to use Welsh in everyday life. But there are many questions about how it will work. There is already a shortage of Welsh-speaking teachers - the government said it was working to boost skills but that could take many years. Although the use of Welsh, perhaps through songs and greetings, is already embedded in many English-medium primary schools, boosting provision at secondary level will be much more challenging. And assessment is a key issue. It is logical that the Welsh second language GCSE will ultimately be ditched but it is not clear yet how a single qualification for pupils across all schools would work. The Welsh Government said while it would be up to schools to decide how they approach improving learners' skills, they would need to think about opportunities for learners to listen, read, speak and write in Welsh, possibly in different parts of the curriculum. Welsh, English and \"international\" languages will be included in a new Languages, Literacy and Communication area of learning - one of six broad areas of learning in the new curriculum. Welsh will remain compulsory for pupils aged 3-16. International languages will include modern foreign languages such as French and German as well as \"community languages, classical languages and British Sign Language (BSL\n\nSummary:",

Smith was found guilty of the double murder after a jury trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. During the trial, the court heard evidence that Smith had ended his relationship with the victim, Isobel Parker, after she had moved on and become pregnant by a new partner. Despite the break-up, Smith could not accept the end of the relationship and became obsessed with Ms Parker. In December 2014, Ms Parker informed Smith that she was pregnant and that the child was not his. After finding out about the pregnancy, Smith became increasingly obsessed with Ms Parker and began to threaten and harass her. He would send messages saying that he would kill her if she didn't return to him and he would \"put a bullet\" in the head of the unborn baby if Ms Parker didn't abort the child. In a police interview following the murder, Smith stated that he had gone to Ms Parker's home and killed her and her unborn child because he didn't want the unborn child to grow up without a father and he didn't want his reputation as a father to be tarnished. Ms Parker's body was found in the bath at her flat in Booth Place on 17th July 2015. The court was told that Ms Parker was buried with her unborn child in her arms. During the sentencing hearing, a statement was read out from Ms Parker's partner at the time of her murder by Smith. In his statement, Mr Shane Anderson said his \"whole world stopped\" when he found out about Ms Parker's death and he said he had gone to her grave every day.

She was not seen in public for months over the summer and went silent on social media, before turning up in early October with a grovelling apology for evading taxes. Two days after she re-appeared, it emerged that the president of global policing agency Interpol, Meng Hongwei, had disappeared on a trip to China. His wife says his last communication with her was a text with a knife emoji, which she took to mean he was in danger. On 8 October, Chinese authorities announced he was being investigated for bribe-taking. While these two cases have triggered a wave of international attention, forced disappearances are nothing new in China. Disappearance, confession, sentence But these latest instances \"show just how fundamental such enforced disappearances have become to governance in China under President Xi\", says Michael Caster, a researcher and author of The People's Republic of the Disappeared. Typically, he says, the scenario plays out like this: The disappearances can target people from different walks of life: human rights lawyers, corrupt officials, officials who are targeted for political reasons, book-sellers who publish material that angers party leaders, or prominent people who fall foul of the party for one reason or another. China's rules always rule Since Xi Jinping took over as China's top leader in 2012, the space for dissent in China has shrunk - and activists say the crackdown is getting tougher and more systematic. President Xi's anti-corruption drive has disciplined more than a million officials since 2012. Critics have long accused the government of using the highly popular campaign as a political tool to target rivals. From a domestic perspective, far more prominent figures - politically speaking - than Ms Fan or Mr Meng have been ensnared.

At the same time, the Education Authority will receive an additional \u00a319 million to ease pressures on teacher and non-teaching staff salaries, which can be used to address the backlog in assessment and diagnosis as well as cover costs such as transport.

He also said voters had not been given enough facts before the EU referendum. \"The unintended consequences of Brexit will be significant for everyone across the UK,\" he said. 'Uncertainty' Mr Kelleher said his bank's immediate concern was over whether to invest further in the UK. This was because the terms of a potential Brexit deal were still unclear. \"It is that uncertainty that is causing problems,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said a bigger worry was whether banks would retain their \"passporting rights\" after Britain leaves the bloc. These rights currently allow them to trade across the bloc without the need for individual country licences. He said: \"I am convinced that London will retain its reputation as a prestigious global financial services centre. \"But clearly some size of our businesses will have to be moved out of London into European headquarters with the absence of any passporting agreement - but it's very hard to ascertain what that will mean at the moment.\" He also said Brexit was damaging efforts to implement the Capital Markets Union, a European Commission initiative to bolster the low use of capital markets to finance European companies and infrastructure projects. Mr Kelleher noted banks still finance 80% of lending on the continent. For this reason he urged UK ministers and Brussels to include a \"long transitional period\" for banks as part of any Brexit deal. His comments were echoed by Mr Kapito, whose firm Blackrock manages assets worth almost $5tn (\u00a33.8tn). \"I don't think there is any good [financial services] firm that has not already started to look at real estate in different areas outside the UK in case they have to move larger operations,\" Mr Kapito said. \"There \n\nSummary:",

Despite this, the bank does not anticipate a sharp rebound in the third quarter of the year; instead, the economy is predicted to experience a meagre 0.3% of growth during that period.\n4. The bank's revision of the economy's current condition can be attributed to various factors, including volatile UK data and a no-deal Brexit.\n5. One of the main contributing factors to the revision of the economy's condition is the bank's accumulation of evidence suggesting that businesses, both small and large, believe that the ongoing trade negotiations with the EU will take longer and be more substantial than previously anticipated.\n6. As a result of these factors, the bank has calculated a one-in-three chance of an annual contraction in growth by early next year, a condition that would almost certainly constitute a recession.\n7. However, the bank's economic forecasts are affected by an inconsistency; while the bank's economic data assumes a smooth and relatively uncomplicated exit from the EU, the UK's financial markets, particularly sterling and UK government debt, anticipate a hard exit from the Union and a no-deal departure from the trading block.\n8.

Between April and May, the Bank now believes that the British economy stalled. The quarterly GDP figure for the second quarter of 2019 is now predicted to be 0, rather than the 0.2% predicted at the last economic forecast in May. But it does not then anticipate a sharp rebound in the current quarter - growth is forecast in the third quarter at 0.3%. Taken together, the Bank now believes that PM Boris Johnson has inherited an economy not in recession, but in the middle of a weak six-month stretch in growth. Now, some of that is down to \"volatile\" UK data. Stockpiling boosted the economy in the first quarter, but that will more than reverse. The shutdowns in car factories around no-deal Brexit plans for March also dragged on the economy, but should at least partially bounce back around now. But the bigger picture is that the Bank has amassed evidence that businesses small and large now believe that Brexit uncertainty, over ongoing trading arrangements with the EU, is bigger in size and longer-lasting than three months ago. Alongside slower global growth, this has hit business investment and therefore underlying growth too. High chance of recession There is now a one-in-three chance, the Bank calculates, of an annual contraction in growth by early next year, which almost certainly signals a recession - the highest since immediately after the referendum. However, the entire exercise is \"affected by an inconsistency\", acknowledges the Bank. While it has chosen to forecast a smooth Brexit, since Theresa May failed to pass her withdrawal deal, markets have been increasingly pricing in the chances of a leaving the EU without a deal. Some markets see a 40% chance of no-deal.

Coatbridge to Hollywood Writer Mark Millar is unquestionably one of the most popular and influential comic creators in the world; having spent his formative years in his native Coatbridge, he now resides in Glasgow where he tirelessly produces hit after hit. Millar's comic-book series Wanted was adapted into a Hollywood action movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy with a production budget of $75m. It grossed $340m worldwide and a sequel is in pre-production. More importantly, the story and characters are not owned by a large corporation like Marvel or DC Comics in the way Batman, Superman and the X-Men are - it is entirely creator-owned by Millar and his artist collaborator JG Jones.

The move comes as Welsh Government legislation to abolish the right to buy across the whole of Wales is proceeding through the assembly. Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Flintshire and Denbighshire have already suspended Right to Buy. Manifesto pledge Councillor Lynda Thorne, Cardiff's cabinet member for housing, said the city had about 8,300 people on the waiting list for social housing. \"We have to do everything we can to ensure we are providing good quality housing for those most in need, both now and into the future,\" she said. \"In 1985 the council had 23,000 properties but, largely through the right to buy, that figure has reduced to our current stock in the region of 13,400 properties.\" She said the authority was committed to delivering 1,000 affordable council homes over the next five years. Ending the flagship policy of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was pledged in Welsh Labour's assembly election manifesto. Mr Sergeant said: \"This damaging policy is further increasing the pressure on our social housing supply and is forcing many vulnerable people to wait longer for a home. \"Legislating to end the right to buy is the only sure way to prevent this and give social landlords the confidence to invest in building more of the affordable homes Wales needs.\"\n\nSummary:",

Every 18 months, the plant shuts down for a refueling outage, during which time the reactor's fuel rods are replaced and the plant's systems and components are inspected and maintained. To carry out the refueling and maintenance work, an additional 1,000 workers are brought onto the site for the duration of the outage. These workers are hired from a variety of locations, including France and the United States, as well as from local contractors. Jim Crawford, the station director at Sizewell B, said that during the refueling outage, the reactor would shut down and all of the fuel rods would be removed. A certain amount of the old fuel would be replaced with new fuel to keep the plant running. Crawford said that the refueling outage would allow the plant's systems and components to be upgraded and maintained. He estimated that around 14,000 tasks would be completed during the refueling outage. Sizewell B typically employs around 500 staff and 250 contractors.

An additional 1,000 workers are being brought on to the site to carry out work while the plant is shut down. Sizewell B, operated by EDF Energy, was opened in 1995 and generates enough power for more than two million homes. Station director Jim Crawford said: \"The reactor will shut down, then we take all the fuel out. \"We replace a certain amount of the fuel with new fuel to give us enough energy to keep going. \"Because we have to do the refuelling every few months, we take the opportunity to maintain and upgrade the plant so there will be some project work.\" He said 14,000 tasks would be carried out during the shutdown. Workers have been brought in from as far afield as France and the United States, but much of the work will be carried out by local contractors. The plant usually employs 500 staff and 250 contractors. Discussions about whether there will be a Sizewell C are continuing. EDF Energy and the government have yet to reach agreement over how to finance the new generation of nuclear power stations.\n\nSummary:",

Fifty years on from the find, scientists from the University of Edinburgh and National Museums Scotland are preparing a detailed study of it. It has been identified as being from a family of animals called ichthyosaurs. The ancient reptiles grew to about 4m (13ft) in length and had long, pointed heads filled with hundreds of cone-shaped teeth, which they used to feed on fish and squid. The Storr Lochs Monster is the most complete skeleton of a sea-living reptile from the \"Age of Dinosaurs\" that has ever been found in Scotland, the researchers said. Skye is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the Middle Jurassic Period can be found. The period saw the appearance of some of the first mammals, birds and reptiles such as snakes. Fantastic beasts and where to find them Welcome to Scotland's Jurassic Park. Its dinosaurs might be long dead and no threat to puny humans, but Skye's rich fossil record has provided palaeontologists with important clues to the lives of prehistoric predators and their prey. According to Dr Neil Clark, of the Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow, the Misty Isle's fossils include \"very rare\" dinosaur remains from the Middle Jurassic, a period of Earth's history still a mystery to scientists because of a shortage of fossil evidence from the time. Eight years ago, scientists revealed that the earliest turtles known to live in water had been discovered on the island. The 164 million-year-old reptile fossils were found on a beach at Cladach a'Ghlinne, on the Strathaird peninsula in southern Skye. The new species, Eileanchelys waldmani, which translates as \"the turtle from the island\", formed a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern, aquatic descendants.

It said it would mean \"no involuntary furloughs or cuts in pay rates or benefits for the next six months\". Staff will also be offered \"enhanced voluntary leave and early retirement options\". Last year the company made a $2.9bn profit and returned $1.3bn to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, according to Bloomberg. Under the massive $2.2tn coronavirus relief bill passed by the US Congress last week, $50bn was set aside for airlines with half given as grants. The other half will be offered as loans in exchange for not furloughing employees until at least 30 September. American Airlines, the world's biggest by passenger numbers, said it hoped to be back to flying a full schedule by then. \"These funds are being distributed to ensure continuation of essential airline service and protect jobs. We intend to apply for these funds and are confident that, along with our relatively high available cash position, they will allow us to fly through even the worst of potential future scenarios,\" said the email to staff from chief executive Doug Parker and president Robert Isom. Global airlines have struggled as countries worldwide have grounded the majority of passenger flights since February as part of efforts to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Another US airline, Delta, has also offered voluntary leave of absence, and carriers outside the US such as Singapore Airlines have unveiled plans to raise funds by tapping share and debt markets with the backing of sovereign investment fund Temasek Holdings.\n\nSummary:",

Following Mr Haider's death last week a series of blog posts described as anti-Islamic have circulated, but their authorship was not immediately clear. Strike call The clashes come amid renewed tension over a tribunal judging war crimes committed during the 1971 independence war. Last week, Bangladesh's parliament amended a law which will allow the state to appeal against the life sentence given by the tribunal to an Islamist party leader. In recent weeks a group of bloggers, including Mr Haider, had launched mass protests demanding his execution and a ban on the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami. Islamist parties have called for a nationwide general strike on Sunday in protest at the killing of their supporters in recent clashes. The Islamist party denies being involved in war crimes and says the tribunal is part of a government vendetta against the party. Human rights groups have said the tribunal falls short of international standards.

Researchers said identifying the mechanism could lead to new therapies in the future. About 10,000 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with bladder cancer. 'Mechanism manipulation' Bladder cancer becomes invasive when the illness grows through the muscle layer of the bladder. When this occurs, there is a higher risk the cancer would spread to other areas and becomes more difficult to treat, researchers say. The newly-published research by the university, in the American Journal of Physiology: Renal Physiology, looks at a protein, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), which is present in most bladder cancers. Researchers, led by Prof Raymond Playford and Dr Tanya Marchbank, said they had identified the role PSTI played in the signalling process that allowed the cancer's spread. Developing ways to interrupt the process could lead to new treatments, researchers said. Professor Playford said: \"Although bladder cancer can be readily treated if caught early enough, once it starts to invade into deeper tissues and spread to distant sites, it is a much more difficult, painful and life-affecting cancer to live with. \"By identifying the mechanism by which bladder cancer develops and spreads, we hope that in time therapies that manipulate this mechanism may be developed to improve the quality of life and survival rates of those with invasive bladder cancer.\"\n\nSummary:",

The potential risk of copycat incidents after celebrity cases is known to public health bodies. It cannot be known for certain if his death led to the spike but it appeared to be connected, the new study said. Experts say \"irresponsible\" media coverage of suicides can play a big part in copycat cases. 'Twenty-four-hour news cycle' Williams, who starred in films such as Good Morning, Vietnam and Good Will Hunting, was found dead in August 2014. At the time of his death, the Samaritans warned about a large number of news articles giving too much detail about the nature of his suicide, against media guidelines. Guidance from the World Health Organization, the Independent Press Standards Organisation's editors' code of practice, the Ofcom broadcasting code and the BBC's editorial guidelines all advise against going into explicit detail about the methods used. However, researchers said there was \"substantial evidence\" that many media outlets had tended to deviate from these guidelines. For the latest study, they looked at the monthly suicide rates from the US government Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between January 1999 and December 2015 to see if there had been a spike. They found there were 18,690 suicides between August and December 2014 compared with the 16,849 cases they would have expected. In the weeks after Williams's death, there was a \"drastic\" increase in references to suicide and death in news media reports, as well as more posts on an internet suicide forum researchers monitored, the study found. David Fink, one of the study's authors, from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said research had previously shown that suicide rates increased following a high-profile celebrity suicide, but this was a first time such a study had been done within the era of the 24-hour news cycle.

Calder's revolutionary approach to sculpture inspired the likes of Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Beuys and continues to influence contemporary artists to this day.

The exhibition, Alexander Calder: Performing Sculpture, opens at London's Tate Modern on 11 November. It is billed as \"the most comprehensive exhibition\" of the American artist's work ever to be held in the UK. Tate's director of exhibitions, Achim Borchardt-Hume, said: \"We thought it time to look at Calder as a serious artist again.\" The show will bring together approximately 100 works to reveal how Calder (1898-1976) changed the idea that sculpture was a static object into something that could be continually changing. \"Historically, sculpture was a solid object that you had to walk around to experience in three dimensions,\" said Borchardt-Hume at Monday's launch event. \"Calder turned this upside down. He makes sculpture move. We no longer move around it - it moves for us.\" Calder initially trained as an engineer before studying painting in New York. He travelled to Paris in the 1920s where he developed his wire sculptures and, by 1931, had invented the mobile - a term first coined by Marcel Duchamp to describe Calder's motorised works. After 1932, Calder worked mainly on suspended sculptures that moved without motors, animated by air currents. Asked about air currents within Tate Modern, Borchardt-Hume told the BBC: \"There should be enough visitor flow to keep them moving gently.\" The gallery's air conditioning may also help, but visitors won't be able to touch the mobiles to set them in motion. \"It'll be a bit like watching the clouds drifting across the sky,\" added curator Ann Coxon. \"These sculptures really invite you to slow down. The movement is going to be subtle and drifting.\" The largest work on display will be Calder's Black Widow (1948), which is being shown for the first time outside Brazil.

The \u00a3448m scheme was launched by Prime Minister David Cameron following the 2011 riots in various English cities. The government defines troubled families as those facing multiple problems including unemployment, anti-social behaviour and truancy. One estimate is that each troubled family costs taxpayers \u00a375,000 a year. Under the Troubled Families programme, councils are paid up to \u00a34,000 for each family they get off the \"troubled\" list, often by giving them intensive, targeted support with all aspects of life. The government says that authorities are now working with 62,000 families - half the overall target - 18 months into the programme, which ends in 2015. 'Great strides' Ministers say 22,000 families have been turned around with children in school, youth crime and anti-social behaviour significantly reduced and more than 1,400 adults in continuous work. The Department for Communities and Local Government said Wakefield had turned around more than half of its 930 troubled families and Leicestershire almost half of its 810. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the results so far showed that councils were making \"great strides\". \"I am delighted that our programme is already helping half of our target of 120,000 troubled families at its mid way stage,\" he said. \"Councils are making great strides in a very short space of time, dealing with families that have often had problems and created serious issues in their communities for generations. \"These results show that these problems can be dealt with through a no-nonsense and common-sense approach, bringing down costs to the taxpayer at the same time.\" Louise Casey, head of the Troubled Families programme, said: \"This programme is getting to grips with families who for too long have been allowed to be caught up in a cycle of despair. \"These results show that a tough, intensive but supportive approach has a big imp\n\nSummary:",

The competition - run by the Woodland Trust - celebrates the country's best loved trees from historic giants to those with a special local story to tell. The much-loved Big Tree was nominated by members of the public. It is a well-known and much-loved landmark in Kirkwall, used as a meeting place by generations of Orcadians. Some might argue it owes its existence to Napoleon. During the Napoleonic wars international trade collapsed and the kelp industry boomed in Orkney, producing ash to be made into soap and glass. A number of Orcadians became very wealthy and built grand houses at Kirkwall. One of these houses had a walled garden in which three sycamore trees were planted. In the 1870s, a new owner felled two of the trees causing a public outcry that saved the third. As Kirkwall grew the Big Tree eventually found itself in a street rather than a garden. In the late 20th Century a public outcry once again saved it when the local authority planned to remove it. The People's Postcode Lottery has provided the prize, a \u00a31,000 care package for the winning tree. The award can be used to arrange an expert health check, provide interpretation or educational materials, or hold a celebratory event in honour of the tree. Two runner-up trees - McCabe's Spruce in Perthshire and the Beauly Sycamore will also receive \u00a3500 care packages.

Cryptographic storage Troy Hunt, a security expert who revealed details of the flaws on his blog, told the BBC he believed the Tesco website was breaking some fundamental data storage rules. \"When a website stores passwords, how they're protected in the database is important,\" he explained. \"If that database is breached, the only thing saving someone's credentials is the way they're protected in storage. What should have happen is that there should be some form of cryptographic storage - not in plain text.\" Mr Hunt pointed out that as Tesco was able to email users their password in plain text, this showed the data was not being stored cryptographically. A more secure method of password recovery is for websites to email users instructions on how to reset their password, rather than revealing the password itself. Security expert Graham Cluley echoed Mr Hunt's concerns. \"It does appear as though Tesco didn't really follow industry best practice with their site. \"That's not to say that people's detail are at risk or that they're in danger of being hacked - but it's surprising to see how Tesco has designed its site with regards to how it stores its passwords.\" 'Full review' Mr Hunt also criticised Tesco for not using HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure - across its entire site.

In a tweet, the 75-year-old cancer survivor said she was resting at home with \"mild, cold-like symptoms\".

    "generated_text": "The article provides an overview of the life and career of filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci, focusing on his key films and his contributions to the film industry. One of the key films discussed is 'The Conformist' (1970), which was adapted from Alberto Moravia's novel and addresses the history of fascism in Italy. The film was lauded for its visual mastery and influence on other films such as 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather: Part II'. Bertolucci's second film, 'Last Tango in Paris' (1972), starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider, received critical acclaim and garnered two Academy Award nominations. However, the film's graphic sex scene involving butter caused controversy and led to Schneider's criticism of the film's director, Bernardo Bertolucci. Despite the controversy, 'Last Tango in Paris' remains a cult classic and an important film in the history of cinema. Another key film discussed is 'The Last Emperor' (1987), which follows the life of the last emperor of China, Pu Yi. The film won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Bernardo Bertolucci. Overall, the article highlights the contributions of Bernardo Bertolucci to the film industry and his legacy as one of the most influential and innovative filmmakers of his generation.\n\nClick the link below for the article",

Adapted from Alberto Moravia's 1951 novel, it addressed Italy's fascist history with a plot revolving around a member of the secret police who is tasked with assassinating his anti-fascist former professor, who's in exile in Paris. It was lauded for its eerie, operatic imagery, which is credited for influencing The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II. Francis Ford Coppola even recruited Bertolucci's cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, for 1979's Apocalypse Now. The Conformist earned Bertolucci his first Oscar nomination - for best adapted screenplay rather than best director. Last Tango in Paris (1972) Two years later, Bertolucci was nominated for best director for Last Tango in Paris, and Marlon Brando was nominated for best actor, a year after he'd won for The Godfather. Brando plays Paul, an American in Paris, who deals with his wife's suicide by shacking up with Jeanne (Maria Schneider) in an empty apartment. His anguished monologue over the body of his wife was \"perhaps the best acting he has ever done\", critic Roger Ebert declared. But the dark, torrid story about love and grief shocked as soon as it was released, and the film was banned in Italy for a brutal, now-notorious sex scene involving butter. The director sparked criticism years later by saying he had come up with the idea for the butter scene with Brando that morning without telling Schneider because he \"wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress\". In a 2007 interview, Schneider said she that although the scene was simulated, she had felt \"humiliated\" and \"a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci.\" The Last Emperor (1987) This epic tale of Pu Yi, who became emperor of China at the age of three, was Bertolucci's critical and commercial pinnacle. Pu Yi was dethroned at six but \n\nSummary:",

The collision occurred on the A141 near Wyton, Cambridgeshire, in June 2014 and involved a delivery lorry driven by Warby and another lorry driven by a different driver. The court heard that Warby was driving at a speed of 85km/h (53mph) on a stretch of single carriageway where the speed limit for lorries was 64km/h (40mph). The prosecution argued that Warby's reckless and cavalier driving caused the collision, and his previous convictions for speeding and using a mobile phone while driving were brought up as evidence of his carelessness. In 2015, Warby was banned from driving for a year for drink-driving. The court sentenced him to six years in prison for Garrett's death, and the judge stated that he had not learned from his previous court appearances and his deplorable driving caused the tragic loss of Garrett's life.

More on this and other news from Cambridgeshire and Norfolk He was also banned from driving for 10 years. During a nine-day trial, Peterborough Crown Court heard Warby had opened a text message one minute and six seconds before the crash. His vehicle crossed the white line in the centre of the road and clipped an oncoming lorry, showering two cars in debris, before crashing into Mrs Garrett's Renault Clio, which was in the oncoming line of traffic. Warby was driving at 53mph (85km/h) on a stretch of single carriageway restricted to 40mph (64km/h) for lorries at the time of the collision, the prosecution said.

'Self-defence' Mr Lewis said he was still clutching a metal pole, which could have been used in a fight between the men, with him left to \"die where he fell\". The court heard Mr Baxter and his partner Linda Rowley owned the caravan next door to Mr Clark, while the other defendant, Mr Ward, also lived nearby on the park. Mr Lewis said a post-mortem examination suggested Mr Clark suffered injuries to his left arm and hand \"consistent with defence wounds\" before his death. He said it was only the defendants involved in the incident, adding that Mr Baxter admitted stabbing Mr Clark \"in self-defence\". The prosecutor said the defendant also told police he grabbed it because it was \"the nearest object\" and the victim \"fell on to the knife\". The trial continues.\n\nSummary:",

The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year to watch its so-called \"angels\". In 2018 it saw its lowest ratings ever, drawing criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity. The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to \"evolve\" its marketing strategy at the time. It has arguably been eclipsed in recent years by Savage X Fenty, the lingerie line by singer, actress and businesswoman Rihanna, whose events showcase a range of body types. There was also a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then chief marketing officer Ed Razek. He suggested \"transsexual\" people should not be a part of the fashion show.

MPs are to vote on legalising same sex weddings, on Tuesday, but a number of Tory MPs are likely to oppose the bill. Conservative activists have signed letters voicing both opposition to, and support for, the move. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill would enable same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies, where a religious institution had formally consented, in England and Wales. It would also allow couples who had previously entered into civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage. 'No good reason' The plans have been strongly backed by Prime Minister David Cameron, but he is facing significant opposition from within his own party. Reports suggest upwards of 120 Tory MPs could vote against the plans, including some cabinet ministers. MPs will have a free vote on the issue, meaning they will not be issued orders by party whips, but the measure is expected to get through, with most on the Labour and Lib Dem benches supporting it. Maria Miller, who is leading the bill through Parliament, defended the proposals, saying marriage as an institution had always evolved and would continue to do so. \"The proposals for change are straightforward - if a couple love each other, then the state should not stop them getting married unless there is good reason - and being gay is not reason enough,\" she said. \"This bill is about choice. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who don't agree.\" On Sunday, more than 20 current and former constituency chairmen delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street urging the prime minister to delay any parliamentary decision on gay marriage until after the next election.

So is she right? Has the much vaunted Burmese reform project ground to a halt? The answer depends on how narrowly you define reform. When she speaks, Ms Suu Kyi is thinking politics. The pace of political change has certainly slowed. In part that's because the easiest reforms took place in the first 18 months of Thein Sein's presidency. In the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army. Political prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations. In a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible. Stories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events. But the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could. 'Disciplined democracy' So did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge. Ms Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged. Drafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution. This is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\". The opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most. They are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a ve\n\nSummary:",

They claim the regime subjected them to \"an unlawful, discriminatory and/or disproportionate interference\" with practising Muslims' right to religious freedom as they had to pray in their cells. Opening the claimants' case Stephanie Harrison QC said: \"From its outset, Brook House has operated and continues to operate the most restrictive regime, based on a category B prison, of prolonged and multiple lock-ins which significantly curtail and restrict the residual liberties and freedoms of administrative detainees.\" She said the Home Office had \"in effect surrendered and/or abdicated its responsibilities to set the minimum standards and conditions required.\" Thomas Roe QC, for the Home Office, said in written submissions \"all immigration removal centres have a 'night state\"'. He said the Home Office's contract with G4S meant the Secretary of State could \"alter the hours of the night state if she so wished.\" He told the court: \"While it is true that Brook House is a secure environment and was built to Prison Service category B standard, it does not follow that detention there is like incarceration as a prisoner at a category B prison.\" Mr Justice Cavanagh, who will hear the case over three days, is expected to reserve his judgment.

Three hundred men are taking part in the trials, from three London GP surgeries. Developing better diagnostic tests that could be used as part of a nationwide screening programme is a research priority for prostate cancer. At present, there is no single, reliable test for prostate cancer. The PSA blood test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used. But the PSA can give false positives and sometimes misses more aggressive cases. The new DNA test was created by a group of international scientists based at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London. They studied more than 140,000 men and identified 63 new genetic variations that can increase the risk of prostate cancer. The DNA test combines those variants with more than 100 others previously linked to prostate cancer. Ros Eeles, professor of oncogenetics at the ICR, said the study was \"very significant\". \"By looking at the DNA code of tens of thousands of men in more depth than ever before, we have uncovered vital new information about the genetic factors that can predispose someone to prostate cancer, and, crucially, we have shown that information from more than 150 genetic variants can now be combined to provide a readout of a man's inherited risk of prostate cancer.\" Only those men found to be at higher risk of prostate cancer would then be scanned and have a prostate biopsy, so researchers hope it could prevent unnecessary procedures. \"It could have a substantial impact on how we actually manage those at increased risk because if you find the disease earlier it's much easier to treat it and much more easy to cure,\" says Prof Elees.

The margin between the two has narrowed to within 0.5% of each other. Florida's gubernatorial race between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis could also face a recount. On Tuesday night, Mr Scott announced his victory - and was even congratulated via phone by President Donald Trump - but Mr Nelson did not make a concession speech at the time. The next morning, Mr Nelson, who has served 18 years as senator, said in a statement: \"We are proceeding to a recount.\" The Scott camp responded by calling the Democrat's reticence to concede \"a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career\", NBC News reported. But now that the margin between them has narrowed to nearly 22,000 votes as of Thursday, Florida State Law mandates a statewide recount. The Florida senate campaigns were one of the most expensive this election season, with over $96m (\u00a373m) spent in total. Reaction over the senate race has drawn immediate comparisons to Florida's 2000 presidential election recount dispute that allowed Republican George W Bush to win the presidency. The governor's race may also face a recount. On Thursday morning, Mr Gillum's team walked back his earlier concession to Republican Mr DeSantis. \"It has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,\" his campaign said in a statement, noting they are ready for a state-mandated recount. Mr Gillum trails Mr DeSantis now by less than 38,000 votes, which is in recount range if the margin holds. Meanwhile in Georgia, Republican Brian Kemp has resigned as secretary of state after claiming victory in the gubernatorial election.

For instance, FE colleges teach a range of courses leading to professional or technical qualifications, apprenticeships and essential skills. Courses in subjects related to healthcare, construction, engineering and information technology are among the most popular. Some pupils in schools also take courses such as BTECs.

It has been a tough week for Volkswagen. It has been fined $4.3bn, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges - and six executives are facing charges. One of them, Oliver Schmidt, has spent the past few days in a Miami jail. Others may yet find themselves in the firing line. But because of this, we now have a very clear idea not only of what Volkswagen was doing wrong, and how it went about it, but also the measures that were taken to conceal that wrongdoing. As part of its plea bargain with the US authorities Volkswagen signed up to an agreed \"Statement of Facts\". It draws heavily on the results of an investigation by the law firm Jones Day, commissioned by VW itself. The FBI makes further detailed allegations in its criminal complaint against Oliver Schmidt. These have not yet been tested or admitted. 'Defeat device' According to these documents, the seeds of the scandal were sown in 2006, when VW were designing a new diesel engine for the US market. Supervisors in the engine department realised they had a problem. They could not design an engine that would meet tough emissions standards due to enter into force in 2007, and at the same time give customers the performance that they wanted. Their solution was to ask their engineers to design engine management software which would turn on emissions controls when the car was being tested, and turn them off when it was being driven on the road. This 'defeat device' software was able to recognise the standard testing procedure. It was based on a program developed by VW's subsidiary Audi, which engineers had specifically stated should \"absolutely not be used\" in the US. Not everyone was happy about this, it seems.

Earlier this month the Polish treasury ministry announced it had completed work on a compensation bill but it would not be sent to parliament because it would add a huge 18bn zloty (\u00a34bn; $6.3bn) to the public debt. Poland's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said the decision would be reconsidered when Poland's financial situation improved. Justice delayed Stuart Eizenstat, the US state department's special adviser on the Holocaust, said the US was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement. Nazi Germany exterminated about 90% of Poland's pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million in World War II. The victims were stripped of their property, meaning there are now many claims from relatives. But the Jewish claims only account for about 17% of the total. Most relate to Poles who lost property confiscated after the war by the communist regime. The Polish Union of Property Owners estimates there are about one million claimants and the total value of compensation owing is 95bn zloty. Ronald Lauder, President of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), said Poland was \"telling many elderly pre-war landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them\". This criticism led Poland's Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, to say that the US had given up its right to represent its citizens in such cases under a compensation agreement from the 1960s.

Women and equalities minister Nicky Morgan said the move was a \"first step\" but would \"concentrate minds\". The TUC said the measures should include medium-sized businesses and come with fines for non-compliance. The Chartered Management Institute said the new legislation would \"force transparency\" on companies. The plan on bonuses is the first of a number of \"equality-boosting measures\" to be set out in detail this week and hopefully introduced in the first half of 2016, according to Downing Street. Other steps include: Details of exactly what companies must publish and when the scheme will begin will be announced after the results of a consultation, which concluded in September, are released. 'Concentrate minds' More than 10 million workers will be covered by the new transparency rules - although far fewer than that receive bonuses. The measures are contained in the Equality Act 2010, which was introduced by Labour but blocked from implementation by the Conservatives until now. Latest figures show that, overall, women in the UK earn 19% less than men. Up to the age of 40, there is very little difference between the earnings of men and women. But beyond that age, when more women are likely to have taken time out to raise families and work part-time, there is a significant gap. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said publishing salary and bonus information was a \"start\" - but employers needed to look at why women were still being paid less than men and \"do something meaningful about it\". Ms Morgan said the government was \"going further than ever before to ensure true gender equality in the workplace\". She also told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: \"When companies see the gender pay gap in their own company, of their employees, including bonuses, that does start to change behaviours; it [starts] the conversations in the company.\" Chartered Management Instit\n\nSummary:",

The film will tell the true story of a Jewish boy in Italy in 1858 who is taken from his parents, raised as a Catholic and later becomes a priest. Filming will start when Spielberg finishes work on Ready Player One. That sci-fi movie starts filming this summer so The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara is expected to go into production at the start of 2017. Rylance also has to complete work in the Christopher Nolan World War Two film Dunkirk, which goes into production next month. The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara will be written by screenwriter Tony Kushner, known for his work on the Oscar-winning Lincoln. The true story of the six-year-old Mortara became an international scandal which was ultimately thought to lead to the crumbling of the structure of the Papacy, as it was at the time, and then to the unification of Italy. The boy was taken from his family home in Bologna because a servant in his household said she had baptised him as an emergency measure when he was very ill. Mortara grew up as a Catholic under the protection of Pope Pius IX, who refused to return him to his parents despite their pleas. Mortara subsequently became a priest in the Augustinian order. Rylance was formerly best known for his work in the London theatre, including in his role as artistic director of the Globe theatre. He is still active on the West End stage, notably being nominated for an Olivier award for starring as King Philippe V of Spain in Farinelli and the King. He was nominated just hours after winning his first Oscar. But Rylance has become more open to film roles in recent years and The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara will mark his third movie with Spielberg. As well as the Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies, Rylance is also playing the title character in Spielberg's The BFG, based on the best-selling children's book by Roald Dahl. The BFG is set for release this July.\n\nSummary:",

The trade is not only lucrative for the poachers and the smugglers but is also fuelled by people at the end of the supply chain who see the rhino horn as a commodity for sale and purchase. In a desperate attempt to save the animal from total extinction the South African government has commissioned a report on the possible legalisation of the trade of the Rhino's horns. According to the report the government would take control of the trade and make it legal thereby minimising the risks of criminal syndicates involved in the trade and would raise money to support the preservation of the Rhino population. As the trade is illegal at present the government has no control over the trade and the smuggling routes and neither does the government benefit from the proceeds of the trade at all. With the legalisation of the trade the government would have control over the routes and the sale of the commodity as well as the money from the proceeds from the trade and would thus be able to fund the preservation of the Rhino population at present and into the future. Although the trade would be limited and would have a negative impact on the existing preservation and conservation efforts at present the report suggests that the legalisation of the trade would help the preservation of the Rhino species as a whole as the government would have control over the trade and the proceeds of the trade and the money would help preserve the species as a whole and not just for the individual animal.

Over the past three years, gangs are said to have killed more than 800 rhinos for their horns, which can fetch \u00a322,000 ($35,055) per kg on the black market. Poachers use a chainsaw to cut away the rhino's horns, after darting it with a tranquilizer - drugged and helpless the animal bleeds to death. Large syndicates are involved in this multi-billion dollar trade worldwide - exporting the horns from Africa to parts of Asia and the Middle-East. Despite many anti-poaching measures 310 have been killed in South Africa this year, more than 330 had been killed at the end of last year - and the numbers are set to increase, experts warn. In the five years up to 2005, an average of 36 rhinos were killed each year. Some say today's efforts are \"too conventional\" and are not enough. Now South Africa has commissioned a study into whether legalising trade in rhino horn could in fact help to bring down poaching, the Department of Environmental Affairs announced recently. \"We are impartial at this stage but we are looking at all the suggestions which could help us in the fight against poachers,\" the department's spokesperson, Albie Modise, told the BBC. \"We are awaiting submissions and would consider this if we get authentic scientific backing that this would be effective,\" he said. The idea is that legalising rhino horn trade would make South Africa directly responsible for meeting the demand for the horns - taking power out of the hands of poachers and placing it in the hands authorities who would also be sensitive to current conservation efforts. These authorities would do market research into global markets of the trade, said Mr Modise. The department says rhino horn stock piles could also be sold to fund further rhino conservation efforts. Mr Modise says the suggestion first came up at \n\nSummary:",

These were from the 4th Century and featured small ring-shaped ditches with a single burial inside. The latest discoveries also featured ring ditches, suggesting the spearmen may have been descended from that group. \"Many men from the continent were hired by the Romans and posted at frontier towns and cities like Colchester to act as soldiers,\" said Mr Crummy. \"Some then turned on their masters and paved the way for the conquest of much of eastern Britain by their own kind.\" Colchester Archaeological Trust has been working at the Hyderbad site since 2002, on behalf of developer Taylor Wimpey. The highlight of its excavation was the 2005 discovery of a Roman chariot circus in the gardens of the sergeants' mess. It will carry out more work including DNA tests later this year in an attempt to discover exactly when the newly-discovered warriors lived.\n\nSummary:",

There were still 30,000 working in mining, but 700 jobs at the Lewis Merthyr colliery in the Rhondda were under threat. It is now a museum. There were already about 30 car component companies in south Wales when Bridgend - thanks partly to the personal intervention of then-Prime Minister James Callaghan - won the prize. The Ford announcement in 1978 was described in the South Wales Echo as \"the icing on an already substantial cake\" for the automotive sector. The CBI at the time estimated 25,000 were employed in the car industry in Wales, with a turnover of \u00a3350m. Borg-Warner, which made automatic transmissions at Kenfig near Bridgend, had already opened Wales' first 1m sq ft factory, with jobs for more than 1,200 people. Most of its products went to Volvo in Sweden. There were others too, supplying British Leyland - which had two of its own firms in Cardiff and Llanelli, making gearboxes and radiators. The factory opened in 1980 without fanfare at an economically uncertain time. There was a two-week long strike at local newspapers, so the event passed without comment or record. Within a few weeks of the Bridgend plant opening, Ford announced only 1,400, not 2,500 people, would be employed there because of a slump in car sales. British Leyland was also struggling, with \u00a3122m losses announced. Unemployment was more than double 2020's pre-coronavirus figure and inflation was running at nearly 18%. The new range of Ford Escorts - with Bridgend producing 2,000 engines a week for them - were in car showrooms by the end of September 1980.

The firm's share price has fallen by more than 40% since the end of 2014. Boss Marissa Mayer has been under pressure to revitalise the business. Earlier this month Yahoo confirmed it was cutting 15% of its workforce after reporting a $4.3bn (33bn) loss for the year. The job cuts will mean the company will have around 9,000 staff by the end of 2016. 'Improve efficiency' Ms Mayer said: \"Separating our Alibaba stake from Yahoo's operating business is essential to maximizing value for our shareholders. \"We can achieve this by working with the committee... while in parallel, aggressively executing our strategic plan to strengthen our growth businesses and improve efficiency and profitability.\" Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter Marissa Mayer is in the process of drastically slimming the company down - closing global offices and making around 15% of its entire workforce redundant. Yet despite its troubles, around a billion people still turn to Yahoo's core services each month - 60% by using their mobile phones. And so, much like sprucing up your house before putting it on the market, Ms Mayer's goal of late has been to cut costs to such a point that Yahoo looks like a good purchase for a bigger company looking to seize that audience. Who would be interested? Names like Disney and Verizon have been thrown around, but the sense here is that a foreign company seeking to increase its presence in the US would see Yahoo as a massive opportunity. With Yahoo looking to spin off its 15% stake in Alibaba from the rest of what Yahoo does, some think the Chinese commerce giant will want to buy that 15% back, and then perhaps the rest of Yahoo with it. One alternative is for Yahoo to be picked apart bit-by-bit. It owns services like Tumblr and Flickr, valuable web properties in their own right.

Parliament did not debate the changes until after they were introduced in April. The legal challenge came after a lengthy battle between the government, peers, opposition MPs and children's rights groups over attempts to push through the changes which cover the rights to support for children in care. The High Court previously ruled in the government's favour. The regulations affected included legal timescales for social-worker visits to children in care, six-monthly reviews of children's welfare, independent scrutiny of children's homes and senior officer oversight of adoption decision-making for babies and children.

In an open letter to Australian politicians, the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China says there is \"credible evidence\" that the bodies may belong to \"executed prisoners and prisoners of conscience from China\". \"We are astonished that visas and permits for bringing this exhibition into Australia were issued by the Australian Government, given the lack of documentation demonstrating ethical and legal sourcing of each body,\" the letter reads. \"No motivation for profit or political sensitivities could ever justify such a crass and undignified violation of human rights.\" One signatory, Prof Maria Fiatarone Singh from the University of Sydney's medical school, told the BBC that the origin of the bodies - the city of Dalian - was a concern. She described Dalian as the \"epicentre\" for executions of prisoners associated with Falun Gong - a spiritual movement that is banned in China. Prof Vaughan Macefield, from the University of Western Sydney, said he was troubled that the bodies had not been identified. He also noted that most appeared to be young men, whereas medical schools often have bodies donated from older people. What do the organise\n\nSummary:",

Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nThere's been talk of MPs having the whip removed, the prime minister losing his majority in Parliament and of the House of Lords potentially filibustering. If you've been following some of the coverage and started to feel like you're in an exam which you didn't revise for, worry not. Many people feel the same - and not all of them are outside the newsroom! Whether you're glued to the 24-hour news or just checking in with the latest developments, here's our 'back to square one' guide to a few of the words and phrases you'll hear in the next few days. Removing the whip No, it's nothing to do with having your car taken away. A whip is a person in a political party who gets MPs to vote how the party wants them to. Basically, they're there to enforce discipline within the party - to make sure MPs toe the line. So if you're a Conservative MP and the party's trying to pass a new law, the whip is there to make sure you turn up and vote. You might also have heard talk about a \"three-line whip.\" That's a reference to the weekly letter that goes round to MPs and Lords, telling them which votes are coming up. The votes are underlined if your party's whip thinks it's important you back them. If one is underlined three times - the three-line whip - they insist you vote the way they want. Fail to do that and you risk a stiff talking-to, or more severe punishment. The most severe is \"having the whip withdrawn\" - which means you are kicked out of the party within Parliament. You remain an MP but immediately become an independent - not aligned to, say, Labour or the Conservatives. That's what happened to 21 Tory (Conservative) MPs on Monday night, when they voted against their own government. People including Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames and Ken Clarke, who's been a Tory MP for 49 years, were among those who had the whip removed. That means the number of Conservative MPs in the House of Commons has fallen. Which brings us on to... Losing a majority It's all about \n\nSummary:",

The supermodel teased the images from the shoot on Instagram before the full cover was released on Thursday. The pair were first introduced by British Vogue editor Edward Enninful at the awards and went on to the after party together, according to GQ. \"A series of Instagram images with love heart emojis chronicle the friendship that blossomed, which, this year, took a professional turn,\" the magazine says. The pair have teamed up together to work on a new underwear line as part of Skepta's MAINS fashion collection. For the GQ cover shoot, both Skepta and Naomi Campbell are pictured in the brand's boxer shorts. GQ haven't released any more pictures or details of the interview with the pair but says they talk about \"race, sex, love and power\". Although they've never confirmed an official relationship, fans have speculated for a while that they're more than friends. Skepta, whose real name is Joseph Junior Adenuga, has had a meteoric rise and is currently viewed as one of the trailblazers of the grime music scene. That was cemented last year when the 35-year-old's album, Konnichiwa, won the Mercury prize for album of the year. As for Naomi Campbell, 47, she remains one of the most iconic supermodels on the planet. Her CV includes being the first black model to open for fashion house Prada when she walked during Milan Fashion Week back in 1997. She's now a contributing editor for British Vogue and spends a lot of her time campaigning for various charities and causes around the world. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

This was led by the then honorary secretary and wildlife champion Helen Brotherton, who died in 2009. Celebrity help Many other pioneering conservationists have been involved with the work of DWT over the years. In 1985 David Attenborough helped build the causeway to the Macdonald Hide on Brownsea Island; and David Bellamy planted a tree to celebrate the opening of the trust's headquarters at Brookland's Farm, Forston in 1995. More recently, Kate Humble and Bill Oddie presented BBC Autumnwatch from Brownsea Island in 2008; and in 2010 Simon King was at Kimmeridge Bay for BBC Springwatch. DWT's reserves range from West Bexington in the west of the county to Sopley Common in the east. These include rare and precious wildlife habitats from heathland to flower meadows, to wetlands and ancient woods, said a spokesman. Dr Simon Cripps, DWT's chief executive, said: \"Conservation in the new millennium takes in much of the wider landscape outside the reserves - with farmers, fishermen, communities and wildlife gardeners all playing their part.\" DWT has joined other wildlife trusts around the country in campaigning for the protection of the UK's seas.

Harrow, Richmond and Surrey in the south of England performed better than areas further north such as Stoke, Hartlepool and Nottingham. Smoking A significant factor in the regional variation is differences in lifestyle, such as smoking, which is linked to lung cancer. Kensington and Chelsea, East Sussex and Devon all had fewer than 35 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 people. The rate is more than double - in excess of 85 per 100,000, in cities such as Hull, Manchester and Liverpool. A similar website presented by Public Health England led Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to describe the differences in England as \"shocking\". Charlotte Williams, the executive director of London Cancer, said: \"[The tool] means it's easier to identify where we're doing well, and where we could do better, and how we could potentially learn from others. \"This will pinpoint where we need to improve to help ensure everyone gets the best care possible.\" Sara Hiom, director of patient engagement and early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said: \"In the UK we are privileged to have access to valuable information about cancer diagnosis and treatments for different parts of the country. \"We've created this website because we hope that it will allow policymakers and healthcare professionals to understand what's going on in their area \n\nSummary:",

Some 60% of the funds are allocated for local community council-led projects and the remainder to a regional energy-efficiency fund. However, there has been a big increase in the number of wind energy schemes in recent years. There are 26 developments of more than 5MW within the planning system and 148 smaller schemes. A revised framework has been drawn up with the aim of ensuring so-called \"host\" communities - those within a radius of about 10 miles (16km)of a wind farm - get the full benefits.

David Bowles, from the RSPCA, said: \"The scale of the illegal importation of puppies into this country is truly shocking. \"Thousands of dogs arriving at our shores every year may well have started their lives in appalling conditions on a puppy farm where their health and welfare came second to money and profits.\" The RSPCA said the age puppies can be brought into the UK should be raised from 15 weeks to six months, with the Dogs Trust saying such measures \"would eliminate the abhorrent illegal puppy trade overnight\". One woman described how she re-homed a bulldog that was originally brought into the country illegally, but died soon afterwards.

In other developments, Toyota has suspended production at Deeside, and the Church in Wales has said services should be put on hold. Meanwhile, second home owners and caravanners have been urged not to come to north Wales to self-isolate. A GP said health services have been inundated by people with second homes in Gwynedd looking for medical care. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the measures introduced on Monday \"should reduce\" peak demand on the NHS by over 60%. \"It's no longer appropriate for people to be gathering in large groups\", Dr Atherton added. On Tuesday it was announced a second patient in Wales had died from coronavirus. The 96-year-old was being treated at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. Thirteen new cases have tested positive for COVID-19 in Wales, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 149 - although the true number of cases is likely to be higher - and the virus has now been detected in every council area, according to health bosses. Dr Atherton said about 70,000 people in Wales were \"particularly vulnerable\" and he expected further measures to protect them would be announced later this week. He said the issue of whether to close schools was \"under constant review,\" while the testing of NHS staff for the virus was being actively looked at. What else happened on Wednesday?

Wilson was US president from 1913 to 1921 and helped to establish the League of Nations, a forerunner of the UN. However, he supported segregation and imposed it on several federal agencies. He also barred black students from Princeton while serving as university president and spoke approvingly of the Ku Klux Klan. In a separate development on Saturday, the lower house of the Mississippi state congress passed a resolution that could remove the Confederate emblem - now viewed by many as a racist symbol - from the state flag. Mississippi's Republican Governor Tate Reeves tweeted that he would sign a bill to change the current flag if the legislation was approved, saying arguments over the 1894 emblem had become as divisive as the flag itself. The measure now moves to a Senate committee before going to the chamber. Outlining the university's decision on Saturday to remove Wilson's name, Princeton president Christopher Eisgruber said in a statement that \"Wilson's racism was significant and consequential even by the standards of his own time\". He said that the board of trustees had concluded that \"Wilson's racist views and policies make him an inappropriate namesake\" for the university's public policy school. A residential college will also lose Wilson's name. The name of the school will be changed to the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Mr Eisgruber said Princeton had honoured President Wilson \"not because of, but without regard to or perhaps even in ignorance of, his racism\". \"That, however, is ultimately the problem,\" he added. \"Princeton is part of an America that has too often disregarded, ignored, or excused racism, allowing the persistence of systems that discriminate against black people.\" Earlier this month, Monmouth University in New Jersey removed Woodrow Wilson's name from one of its most prominent buildings.

'Brutal crimes' It follows calls from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for an immediate halt to executions in Iraq. A spokesman for Navi Pillay said in October large-scale killings were \"obscene and inhumane\". The claim that the death penalty helped deter terrorism was a \"fallacy\", given the surging violence in Iraq, the spokesman added. \"The justice ministry carried out the executions of 26 men convicted of crimes related to terrorism on Sunday,\" a justice ministry statement said on Tuesday, adding that all of those put to death were Iraqis. It said Mashhadani was \"famous for sectarian crimes\". He was a leader of a Sahwa, or Awakening Council, in Baghdad, according to reports. \"All 26 who were executed carried out brutal terrorist crimes against the Iraqi people, and they were tried and condemned, and the verdict was approved by the presidency,\" Justice Minister Hassan al-Shammari said. He added that the ministry would \"continue to carry out sentences against those who have been condemned, after the final decision has been made\". The Iraqi government maintains that it only executes people who have committed terrorist acts or other serious crimes against civilians. The findings published in Human Right Watch's annual world report on Tuesday put the number of executions in Iraq at its highest since the US-led invasion of 2003.

The Department for the Economy said it was doing everything possible to expedite the scheme. Another scheme for small businesses has already paid out \u00a310,000 grants to thousands of small firms. But that scheme essentially involved one database and so was highly automated. The tourism scheme involves checks against four databases which will have to be done manually. \"The process to identify and validate eligible businesses from different databases is complex and manual,\" the Department for the Economy said. \"However, we our pouring our efforts into delivering it efficiently and effectively.\" 'Upfront staffing costs' NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart said Stormont should make immediate interim payments. She said businesses had anticipated that the grants would be available in advance of the government's coronavirus job retention scheme. That scheme allows employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their wages during the crisis. It is also due to open for applications on 20 April with payments beginning on 30 April. \"Whilst the job retention scheme was welcomed by many tourism businesses, the fact that it has not gone live yet means that businesses are incurring upfront staffing costs which it was anticipated that the grants would have supported,\" said Ms Stuart. \"This meant we would have had an interim cash flow that would have plugged the gap until the scheme went live, however as the grants have not been distributed businesses may not be able to survive until the end of April.\" That view is echoed by Ken Sharpe who owns the Salty Dog Hotel in Bangor.

For a month, the authorities have been playing a game of grandmother's footsteps with the West, as they tried to avoid delivering a verdict during awkward events like the visit of international dignitaries to the annual YES Yalta summit in Crimea, or the EU's eastern partnership summit in Warsaw. Still, the Ukrainians got a tough message by EU standards. For some time now, Ukraine has been trying to finalise a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with Brussels - which is more important than it sounds. In the absence of an EU membership perspective, a DCFTA would help transform Ukrainian society by introducing EU standards in the way that states like Poland or Estonia were transformed in the 1990s. Before the verdict, these agreements were still on track to be signed in December, but the EU had made it clear that depended on Tymoshenko staying out of prison and the Ukrainian authorities were hinting at some messy, face-saving compromise. So many were shocked by the severity of the verdict. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years, and must pay a fine of $190m (\u00a3122m). She is banned from running for office for three years, which would rule her out of the next elections, for parliament, in 2012. The trial itself was already an embarrassment. To try and discourage too many attendees, it was held in a tiny court, which became a packed circus. A young and inexperienced judge failed to defend principles of sub judice in the face of a stream of prejudicial comments from state officials. The authorities switched from one accusation to another before the trial. Worst of all was the failure to provide a smoking gun once they decided the main charge would be Tymoshenko's role in the gas price negotiations with Russia in 2009.

Not bad for a song the record company said would never be played on the radio. Written by frontman Freddie Mercury, Bohemian Rhapsody was painstakingly pieced together in six studios, pushing 1970s recording technology to its limits. The song's multi-tracked 'bismillahs' and 'scaramouches' were overdubbed so often that the tapes became virtually transparent. But the band never lost faith in the track. \"We all realised it was something wonderful and we should give it our heart and soul,\" says Brian May.

Not many - but Bo Rap is one of them. A sprawling, six-minute rock opera, it has been Christmas number one twice, soundtracked a pivotal scene in Wayne's World, and sold 2.44 million copies in the UK alone. Not bad for a song the record company said would never be played on the radio. Written by frontman Freddie Mercury, Bohemian Rhapsody was painstakingly pieced together in six studios, pushing 1970s recording technology to its limits. The song's multi-tracked 'bismillahs' and 'scaramouches' were overdubbed so often that the tapes became virtually transparent. But the band never lost faith in the track. \"We all realised it was something wonderful and we should give it our heart and soul,\" says Brian May. To mark the 40th anniversary, the guitarist looked back at the writing process, the boundary-breaking music video, and the song's resurrection in Wayne's World. THE BEGINNING There was no demo. It was all in Freddie's head and on lots of little pieces of paper, which he used to make notes on. And I mean literally notes. He would put A\u266d, C\u266f, D\u266d in little blocks. So Freddie had the framework in his head and he and Roger [Taylor, drums] and John [Deacon, bass] set out each part as a backing track. Then we set about embroidering it. RECORDING 'THAT' RIFF The heavy bit was a great opportunity for us to be at full pelt as a rock band. But that big, heavy riff came from Freddie, not me. That was something he played with his left hand in octaves on the piano. So I had that as a guide - and that's very hard to do, because Freddie's piano playing was exceptional, although he didn't think so. In fact, he thought he was a bit of a mediocre piano player and stopped doing it later on in our career. GETTING THE SONG PLAYED ON RADIO We were told it was going to be a hard sell, but it ended up being easy because Kenny Everett stole the tape from a playback session we\n\nSummary:",

But several news outlets falsely described the comments as racist, sparking calls online to boycott the bank. Mr Donovan later apologised on TV, saying: \"I apologise for anyone who took any offence from my remarks, which were clearly not intended to offend. \"I got it wrong.

As the Prime Minister told his audience, the themes of his later campaign speeches will focus on education, homes, jobs and pensions. The Nottingham speech concentrated on deficit reduction and \u00a330bn worth of further cuts in government spending in the next parliament. \"When you look at the children you love, do you want to land them with a legacy of huge debts?\" he said. \"We have a responsibility to act. We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.\" The prime minister's choice of the Enterprise Zone - on the Boots industrial campus on the edge of Nottingham - was no coincidence.

Earlier this month Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said she remained supportive of the St Athan plan, but was unable to say if it would proceed while examinations of spending proposals continued. Welsh MPs from across the political parties have campaigned for the academy to proceed. Alun Cairns, Conservative MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, said it should go ahead \"because it is the best military thing to do\". 'Very tricky' The project was originally envisaged as centralising training for the three armed forces, and funded by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as a private finance initiative (PFI). General Dannatt told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: \"This is a very tricky one. \"This has been the policy for 10 years now: to have a single big defence academy and St Athan is the site that has been selected. \"There really is no plan B because the existing training facilities which the three services are using are very rundown and there has got to be a change.\" Gen Dannatt, who has just published his autobiography, Leading from the Front, added: \"So I think this PFI-based solution is the one which will go ahead. \"Maybe it won't be as large, maybe it won't be quite as ambitious as previously. \"I think it's a very difficult issue and one of the key ones on the non-equipment side that the MoD is going to have to grapple with.\"\n\nSummary:",

On the day of the killing, Jennings signed in at Forest Place Nursing Home at about 12:15 BST. Staff reported seeing him drinking tea with Mrs Wilson in the lounge and said she seemed \"very pleased to see her grandson\". They were first alerted to the fact something was wrong when Jennings tapped a nurse on the arm and said: \"I am sorry, I have just killed my nan,\" Chelmsford Crown Court heard. Police were called to the care home at about 13:20 BST where Mrs Wilson was found \"slumped\" in her bedroom on the Kingfisher Unit, surrounded by a \"significant amount of blood\". Prosecutor Stephen Rose said Jennings told a police officer he had \"wanted to get that done for ages\" because he \"couldn't take it any more\". 'Dead anyway' He added: \"She doesn't know who anyone is. She is in agony. She was dead anyway. She was gone as far as I was concerned.\" Police recovered a Jansport backpack from the scene containing one bread knife and one kitchen knife measuring 8cm. Three psychiatrists have since said that in separate meetings, Jennings showed behaviour \"consistent with paranoid schizophrenia\" including \"psychosis, moments of paranoia, delusions and bizarre beliefs\". Forest Place is home to about 100 residents and three supporting units. Mrs Wilson moved there on 30 May 2017.

But the analysis methods that private companies use put it at \u00a310.5bn. There are concerns that such a significant hole in what is the biggest pension fund in the country could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, with 303,000 members, has assets of \u00a337.9bn - more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. By its own official estimate to members this month, that is \u00a37.9bn short of what it needs to pay pensions. Those numbers are disputed by the fund's critics who say that working it out on the formula private companies use - known as FRS17 - would put it at \u00a32.6bn higher. 'Degree of denial' Analysis for Newsnight by pensions consultant John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, showed that to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to \u00a31.8bn.

In its hey-day, it provided for \"an ideal education with reading room, bathhouse, assembly hall, library, theatre, billiard room, kitchen, art and craft studios and a collection of books, artefacts and art\". Honesty - the best policy Today, through the collective efforts of Coniston residents and Grizedale Arts, the institute houses a new public library, new kitchens, indoor markets and the restoration of the reading room. It also has a community-run village \"honest shop\". \"We had been running honest stalls in the village for some time,\" said Alistair Hudson, deputy director of Grizedale Arts, \"and this seemed like a natural extension. \"We have had a soft launch for a couple of months and we've already taken around \u00a33,000. \"This is a shop to which a wide range of local suppliers bring almost anything from frozen farm meat, vegetables, paintings, and the like and they are all sold in an honest manner,\" he added. This community shop opens at 09:00 and is closed at 17:30 each day. The suppliers deliver their goods, sign in the book what they have brought with their own product code - customers do much the same, but leave the money too. The suppliers receive their aggregated percentage of 80% of the takings with the remaining 20% going to the Coniston Institute's upkeep. Although there are a few general stores in the village, there seems to be no real competition. Mr Hudson said the sales in\n\nSummary:",

Curiosity has previously drilled into three rocks to collect powdered tailings for analysis in its sophisticated onboard laboratories. This latest acquisition should give scientists a taster for the type of sediments that lie ahead. The Nasa rover is driving into the nearby foothills of Mount Sharp, a 5km peak at the centre of Mars' Gale Crater. Researchers hope the chemistry of the rocks at the base of this mountain will reveal new details about the environmental history of Mars. Already, the one-tonne robot has established that a lake and rivers were present on the floor of Gale billions of years ago. Scientists say conditions during those ancient times could have supported micro-organisms - had they been present. Curiosity has spent much of the past year simply driving, trying to get to Mount Sharp, which was always intended to be its primary mission target. Wednesday's operation followed a small test hole that was sunk in the Pahrump mudstone on Sunday to check its stability. Drilling a deeper, 6cm hole has the effect of pushing pulverised rock particles up into a collection chamber. After being sifted and sieved, a pinch of this material can then dropped into the labs housed in Curiosity's belly. The mission team is hopeful that the Pahrump sample will have a high silica (silicon) content - something the robot has seen in other rocks in recent weeks when probing their chemistry with spectrometers. This would support other indications that the local sediments were laid down in the presence of abundant water. After two years on the planet, Curiosity has reached what the US space agency says is a critical juncture in its mission. It is now moving off the rocks that make up the crater floor and on to a geological unit known as the Murray Formation. Pahrump is its first chance to sample material in this form\n\nSummary:",

A couple of decades later, people could catch a passenger flight to London, Cardiff, Birmingham and beyond. With a population of just over 5,300 at the last Census, the town, in the historic county of Radnorshire, is an unlikely spot for an air travel hub. Why Llandrindod Wells? In part, because municipal leaders had big ambitions for the town, according to local historian Phillip Jones. \"Llandrindod had an extremely progressive and outward-thinking local council, who before most others, foresaw the potential for air travel to increase the relevance of isolated towns like theirs,\" he said. Mr Jones, author of Early Birds and Boys in Blue: A Century of Flight in Radnorshire, added: \"By 1913 they'd invited renowned pilot Gustav Hamel to carry out a demonstration over what was then little more than a cut strip in a field, and after that the town's reputation was established as the Welsh centre for aviation, before Cardiff and Swansea had even got out of the blocks.\" The driving force behind the move was local councillor Tom Norton. The automobile entrepreneur branched out into selling aeroplanes from his dealership, and to this day the word \"Aircraft\" can be seen on the front of the town's Automobile Palace building. The 1920s and 1930s were the heyday of exhibition flying in Britain as the number of trained pilots and aircraft engineers shot up following World War One. One of those pioneering aviators was Sir Alan Cobham, who flew the first plane from London to Cape Town in 1926. In 1932 Tom Norton managed to attract \"Cobham's Flying Circus\" to Llandrindod.

The ALR submarine is capable of diving to a depth of 4,000 meters below the surface and has been used to acquire a remarkable set of new data on the movement of deep, cold water. The submarine is named after the winning entry in a public poll to name the UK's future \u00a3200m polar research vessel, but the government felt that it was inappropriate to use the name for the vessel itself. The ALR submarine is part of a class of three robots developed by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in the UK, and the Antarctic venture was the first full science expedition using the submarine. The submarine was programmed to swim through a narrow gap in the ocean-floor ridge that extends northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula, known as the Orkney Passage, a critical \"valve\" in the so-called \"great ocean conveyor\" - the relentless system of deep circulation that helps redistribute all the heat energy that has built up in the climate system. There is evidence that this flow of bottom-water is warming, perhaps because of a strengthening of the winds over the Southern Ocean. Prof Alberto Naveira-Garabato from the University of Southampton, the lead scientist for the investigations conducted from the deck of the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross, is pleased with Boaty's performance. The submarine was able to make a total of three dives, reaching down to 4,000m below the surface, and covering 180km.

The announcement was made at an energy conference in Pittsburgh, and President Trump was flanked by men in hard hats. He described the accord as a bad deal and said that his pro-fossil fuel policies had made the United States an energy superpower. The earliest he could formally start the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement was 4 November. The pull-out would take effect a year later - the day after the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nThe Paris Agreement brought together 195 nations in the battle to combat climate change. It committed the United States to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. President Trump said that if he couldn\u2019t improve that deal, he would pull out. However, diplomatic sources said that there had been no major effort at renegotiation.\n\nThe article then discusses the seek-and-destroy mission conducted by the president\u2019s staff through US environmental legislation. Mr Trump promised that he would turn the United States into an energy superpower, and he attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil, and coal. Mr Trump categorised former US President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy.\n\nThe gas and oil industries are indeed thriving, but Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to resurrect the coal industry has proved much more challenging. Coal can\u2019t compete on price with gas - or, for that matter, with renewables whose costs have plummeted. Firms are also reluctant to invest billions in coal-fired plants that could have a limited life if the next administration rejoins the rest of the world on climate change.\n\nAs coal is the dirtiest fuel, the industry\u2019s woes have held down US emissions, despite the President\u2019s policies. What\u2019s more, many US states, cities,",

Noriega was the key figure in Panama from 1983 to 1989, and was a close ally of the United States in Central America for several decades. His connection with the United States dates back to the 1950s, when he was recruited as a CIA informant while studying at a military academy in Peru. Noriega rose through the ranks of the Panamanian armed forces and became a key supporter of General Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the United States in 1977 to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty. After Torrijos's death in 1981, Noriega became the power behind the scenes as head of the security services.\n\nThe US relied on Panama as a regional listening post and Noriega obliged with unfaltering support for the Contras in Nicaragua and in the fight against the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador. However, the US became increasingly suspicious of Noriega amid indications that he was selling his services to other intelligence bodies, not to mention drug-trafficking organisations.\n\nIn 1988, Noriega was indicted in a US federal court on drug-trafficking charges and was also accused of rigging elections in 1989. By mid-December 1989, ties between the United States and Panama had deteriorated so far that President George H W Bush launched an invasion, ostensibly because a US marine had been killed in Panama City.\n\nIn conclusion, Manuel Noriega was a key figure in Panama for several decades, and was a close ally of the United States in Central America.

His connection with the United States dated back to the 1950s, when according to various accounts, he was recruited as a CIA informant while studying at a military academy in Peru. Noriega, now 77, eventually became a prized American \"asset\" in a region that was becoming politically hostile to US interests in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. He rose within the ranks of the Panamanian armed forces to become a key supporter of Gen Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the US to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty in 1977. After Gen Torrijos's death in a mysterious plane crash in 1981, Noriega became the power behind the scenes as head of the security services. The US relied on Panama as a regional listening post and Noriega obliged with unfaltering support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in the fight against the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador. At the same time, he began to play an increasingly repressive role internally in Panama, especially after the assassination of Hugo Spadafora, a political opponent who was found beheaded in 1985. Noriega allegedly played a role in the mid-1980s Iran-Contra affair, which involved the smuggling of weapons and drugs to aid US undercover efforts to support the anti-government forces opposing the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. However, the US became increasingly suspicious of Noriega amid indications that he was selling his services to other intelligence bodies, not to mention drug-trafficking organisations.

The allegations of sexual abuse against children by Savile prompted more than 100 people to come forward to the police, giving accounts of how they were sexually abused by Savile on NHS premises and in other places. The Department of Health asked hospital trusts to investigate and appointed Kate Lampard QC to oversee the independent hospital investigations. The findings of inquiries at 28 hospitals - including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital - were published in June 2014. Since then, a further wave of allegations emerged at some of the original 28 hospitals, and a further eight hospitals and one ambulance service. Fresh investigations were carried out and reports were published. The reports on 28 hospitals found the late DJ subjected patients, visitors, and staff across the country to \"truly awful\" sexual abuse for more than four decades. Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary ranged from five-year-olds to 75-year-olds, and included men, women, boys, and girls. The allegations included rapes. At high-security hospital Broadmoor, Savile sexually abused at least five individuals, including two patients who were subjected to repeated assaults. The reports found failings at the hospitals in the way complaints were passed on and how access to wards was controlled. How else did police respond to the ITV report claims?

Jimmy Savile, a Radio 1 DJ and BBC presenter, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before allegations he had sexually abused children were broadcast in an ITV documentary. The claims prompted more than 100 people to come forward to police, giving accounts of how they were sexually abused by Savile on NHS premises and in other places. The Department of Health asked hospital trusts to investigate and appointed Kate Lampard QC to oversee the independent hospital investigations. The findings of inquiries at 28 hospitals - including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital - were published in June 2014. What are the latest NHS reports? They are delayed reports into Savile's activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire, Springfield Hospital in London, and Crawley Hospital in West Sussex. Since June, a further wave of allegations emerged at some of the original 28 hospitals, and a further eight hospitals and one ambulance service. Fresh investigations have been carried out and reports have been published. What did the initial NHS inquiries conclude? The reports on 28 hospitals found the late DJ subjected patients, visitors and staff across the country to \"truly awful\" sexual abuse for more than four decades. Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary ranged from five-year-olds to 75-year-olds, and included men, women, boys and girls. The allegations included rapes. At high-security hospital Broadmoor, Savile sexually abused at least five individuals, including two patients who were subjected to repeated assaults. The reports found failings at the hospitals in the way complaints were passed on and how access to wards was controlled. How else did police respond to the ITV report claims? In 2012, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation called Operation Yewtree - following the broadcast of the ITV documentary. The Met Police and childre\n\nSummary:",

However, Asian economies are not as affected by this as one might think. Firstly, the stock market crash has had a knock-on effect on commodity prices, and some Asian currencies have touched multi-year lows. Secondly, there was incompetence on the part of the Chinese government in their inability to halt the market slide despite pumping in an estimated $200bn. Thirdly, the IMF has acknowledged that global growth will be affected by what happens in China, as it makes up such a large part of the global economy. However, many economists believe that Asia will ride it out. To understand why, we must look back to 2008 and the last financial crisis. S&P estimates that Asia's economic growth before the crisis was 5.5%, of which a fifth was driven by external demand from the US and Europe. During the global financial crisis of 2008, S&P says global trade collapsed and has never fully recovered. Therefore, Asia is more resilient to shocks than it was in 2008, and can weather the current storm.",

Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nKarishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@KarishmaBBCon Twitter Hash tags like \"Greatfallofchina\" started to fill my Twitter feed, and as each day brought more falls on the mainland Chinese stock markets (both the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen CSI 300 saw major falls), each day also brought more panic for investors. Research houses put out daily reports trying to make sense of the fear and anxiety amongst investors as billions of dollars evaporated in front of their eyes. But where do Asian economies stand in all of this? And was all the fear and anxiety overblown and misplaced? After all, as one economist told me, \"sometimes markets move so much faster than economists can update their data\". Let's break it down and look at the facts There's no denying that Asian investors were rightly concerned by the stock market falls and recent yuan devaluation in China - there was a knock-on effect on commodity prices and some Asian currencies touched multi-year lows. Adding to concerns was what appeared to be incompetence on the part of the Chinese government after they failed to halt the market slide despite pumping in an estimated $200bn. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came out and acknowledged that global growth would be affected by what happens in China - because it makes up such a large part of the global economy. And then there are low commodity and oil prices - a boon for Asian countries like India which import raw materials and oil, but not so great for countries like Malaysia which is a net exporter of oil. So what that does all of that mean for Asian growth? Well, many economists feel that Asia will ride it out. To find out why, we need to cast our eyes back to 2008 and the last financial crisis. According to Standard & Poor's (S&P), Asia's economic growth before the crisis was 5.5% - a fifth of which was driven by external demand from the US and Europe.

They said the help they received from Petals, at Rosie Maternity Hospital in Cambridge, had been \"crucial\" to their recovery. The baby loss charity has suspended all new, non-emergency referrals. The couple were offered counselling soon after their loss with Karen Burgess, the chief executive of Petals. Mrs Johnson described it as \"so incredibly crucial\" and said it allowed her and her husband to \"properly grieve\". \"The question is whether we'd still be potentially even together...or alive [without it],\" she added. \"Without Karen I don't know if I would have come out the other side.\" Mr Johnson said: \"What Petals provided for us was the silence that we could fill with what we were going through - it was a compassionate, understanding silence.\" Now aged two, their daughter Imogen still needs a feeding tube but Mrs Johnson said she was \"full of life and vigour\". Petals, which relies on grants and donations, announced on Wednesday it was suspending its core service in Cambridge after six years due to a lack of funding. Although NHS cash has been found for its services elsewhere, none has been made available in Cambridge.

Mr Harrison messaged Mr McIlroy telling him that \"the cops went straight to Les Kiss which is...ridiculous.\" The players concerned were then telephoned, according to the messages. Paddy Jackson and fellow Ulster and Ireland rugby player Stuart Olding are accused of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house, in the early hours of 28 June, 2016. The next day, the 19-year-old woman contacted the police. The players were arrested the following day. Mr Harrison was also contacted by police, not initially as a suspect, but to give a witness statement. He had been in Mr Jackson's house on the night in question and had shared a taxi home with the woman. After giving his witness statement, later in the day he exchanged messages with Blane McIlroy. 'Trouble for the lads' In one message, Mr McIlroy stated: \"This is ridiculous. Surely it's all just going to get dropped.\" Mr Harrison texted: \"Hopefully it's just thrown out, Just a silly girl who's done something then regretted it.\" He added: \"She's causing so much trouble for the lads.\" The court also heard a series of messages sent the day after the alleged rapes. Blane McIlroy sent a message to a WhatsApp group with a picture of him and three women. The message said \"love Belfast sluts\". He was in Paddy Jackson's house on the night in question along with Mr Harrison and Mr Olding. 'Catch off guard' Earlier in court a police officer denied that the PSNI mishandled part of the investigation. A defence barrister suggested that police had tried to \"catch off guard\" one of the defendants, Rory Harrison. He is accused of perverting the course of justice and withholding information.

But giving up banking secrecy is likely to be a painful process for the Swiss. While other countries see the practice as a way to hide the ill-gotten profits of crime, corruption, or tax evasion, in Switzerland it is viewed as an honourable policy which illustrates the relation of trust between state and citizen. \"The origin of Swiss banking secrecy... is really a professional secrecy like that of a doctor or a lawyer,\" explains Michel DeRobert, head of the Association of Swiss Private Bankers. \"He is not supposed to give out the data of his clients, he's not supposed to repeat it to other people.\" Honourable history? Those who want to keep the current secrecy often claim that it was first introduced in the 1930s in order to protect German Jews, who were investing their assets in Swiss banks in order to stop the Nazis seizing them. Although this certainly happened, in fact the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 was introduced in the wake of a scandal in which a number of French politicians and businessmen were publicly identified as having hidden their money in Switzerland. The act was designed to protect client privacy in the future. If the recent events surrounding France's disgraced former budget minister Jerome Cahuzac are anything to go by, some European politicians have continued to benefit from the secrecy. Mr Cahuzac, charged with sorting out tax evasion in France, was recently revealed to have put hundreds of thousands of euros in a secret Swiss bank account, in the hope of escaping the attentions of the taxman. Examples like these are causing fury in cash-strapped European capitals. Greece, too, has seen much needed tax revenue disappear into Swiss banks, and a desire to reclaim as much unpaid tax as possible, as soon as possible, is a big rea\n\nSummary:",

Since 2011 they have been used at least 2,486 times - in 635 cases on people with suspected mental health issues. Campaign group Liberty said the hoods were cruel and degrading, but the Police Federation said they \"should be available as standard\". Four further forces are considering introducing the hoods. The hoods were used on 91 people aged under 18 in the last five years, with North Wales Police reporting the use of a spit hood on a 12-year-old girl. What are spit hoods? Mesh fabric hoods placed over the heads of suspects to prevent spitting or biting. They can only be used once and are usually used in custody suites or when moving people in custody from one location to another. Critics say spit hoods are distressing and humiliating, can cause panic in the detained person, and make it harder to notice if a prisoner is having difficulty breathing. The forces who responded to the BBC said they only used the hoods when \"proportionate, appropriate and justifiable\" to protect their officers. Sara Ogilvie, policy officer at Liberty, said the \"disturbing figures\" showed \"cruel, degrading and primitive spit hoods are being widely used\". \"There is no place in a civilised society for police forcibly covering children's faces. \"And their use on those suffering from mental-health problems will have added fear and confusion to an already distressing situation.\" The Metropolitan Police Service is consulting on whether to introduce the hoods. A pilot planned for October was cancelled after London Mayor Sadiq Khan voiced concerns. Lancashire Constabulary, Humberside Police and Durham Constabulary are all also considering introducing them.

New speak Launched in 1911, the Concise Oxford English Dictionary was intended to be an evolving, modern catalogue of words. Its first edition, which is 100 years old this month, included popular slang terms such as shirty, parky and piffle. Emerging technology has always been a big driver for new words. The 1911 edition included biplane - a aeroplane with two sets of wings, and marconigram - a message sent via radio. Other pre-existing words have had their meanings shaped by popular tech culture. In the most recent edition, follower has been amended to also mean \"someone who is tracking a particular person, group, etc. on a social networking site\". Meanwhile, friend has been redefined by the Facebook generation to simply mean someone you regularly interact with online. Senior editor of the dictionary, Fiona McPherson said that it was important to make sure new words have entered common usage. \"First and foremost it's about the evidence.

There have been rumours that there could even be more than one album in the works. Glastonbury is back after a year off and Stormzy will be headlining - he'll probably have new music to show off there too. Here's a bigger list of what music to expect in 2019. Gaming By Newsbeat gaming reporter Steffan Powell Expect the official announcement of the PlayStation 5 sometime in the next 12 months, but before that's available to buy there are some big releases to look out for. If you like a bit of nostalgia in your games then the remake of Resident Evil 2 and the new Mortal Kombat could be the ones for you. For fans wanting something new, games like Anthem and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice are worth considering. They're both new projects from development teams with a history of making classic games. 2019 could be the year that we finally get a sequel to one of my personal favourites - The Last of Us.

But the aim is for schools across the country to remain open, even in any areas that have the strictest restrictions imposed. Full details of the new five-tier system - which will also have a \"level zero\" at the bottom that will allow life to return almost to normal - will be outlined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at about 12:20 GMT.

Llyr Gruffydd MS said: \"The recent increase in littering across Wales has been a concern and a point of frustration for many people across Wales, including for many of my own constituents. \"It seems that fast food and littering tends to go hand in hand, and we need long-term solutions to tackling this issue.\" Jemma Bere, Keep Wales Tidy's policy and research manager, said enforcement was complex and can take up a lot of time and resources - and must be done in conjunction with educating people. \"Research shows us that people are more likely to act responsibly if there is a visible connection to them and the potential crime,\" she added.

Sangin has been a battleground between the Afghan government and the Taliban for years, with both sides vying for control of the area. The Taliban recently recaptured Sangin and is now poised to recapture the district from Afghan forces. This would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces. Sangin is also a rich opium production center, meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The article notes that the Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied rather than fully control them, as they can easily be targeted. However, they may have an advantage among the local population in Sangin, who are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year. The Taliban is likely to seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible.

Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nBy Inayatulhaq YasiniBBC Pashto online editor But the Taliban has been regaining ground in Sangin and is now poised to recapture the district from Afghan forces. Why is this part of Helmand so important to both sides? Regaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC late on Monday that the district administrative office had been abandoned by government forces. But Taliban fighters are cautious about entering it, he said. The Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied, as they have done in the Musa Qala and Nowzad regions of Helmand - where 90% of the districts are said to be under Taliban control but the centres are with the government forces. The Taliban intentionally avoids centres of the districts, where they can easily be targeted. Keeping control of the centre of Sangin would not be easy for the militants, but they may have an advantage among the local population. Many locals are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year which they say wrought unwarranted destruction to homes, farms, and other property. The Taliban will probably seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible, as they did in Kunduz where fighters could be seen posing for photos with civilians. If the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, it should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country. It should deploy troops who do not bear the grudges of those who fought in the civil war in 90s, soldiers who are not \n\nSummary:",

The first days of the operation changed the course of the war. But it was not long before war crimes prosecutors became interested and alleged that the general was responsible for a campaign of ethnic cleansing. About 150 Serb civilians were killed and more than 200,000 left their houses in long columns of cars and tractors laden with possessions. This was compounded by widespread destruction of Serb communities - actively encouraged by Mr Gotovina, the UN war crimes tribunal has heard. He was indicted on war crimes charges in 2001, but denies any responsibility. Fighter and playboy Born on 12 October 1955, near Zadar, on Croatia's Adriatic coast, Ante Gotovina left Tito's communist Yugoslavia at the age of 16. He spent time on a merchant ship before joining the French Foreign Legion, where he built a reputation as a fearsome soldier with a taste for beautiful women. He fought in Chad and spent much of the 1980s in Latin America, notably Guatemala, where he trained paramilitaries fighting that country's vicious civil war. Service in Paraguay, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil followed, and he eventually won French citizenship. He also honed his taste for the high life. The Canary Islands became a regular haunt, and it was in Tenerife where Spanish police eventually arrested Gen Gotovina in 2005 to face trial in The Hague. Originally he had headed to the Spanish islands to rest his war injuries, but he soon joined a paragliding club in San Agustin, Gran Canaria, becoming a familiar face in a string of upmarket resorts. The 1980s also brought scandal. A French court convicted him of robbery and extortion, and there were reports of a growing involvement in right-wing politics.

Flipkart hopes using this expertise will make \"last mile\" distribution of packages more efficient. Online retail has boomed in India and is forecast to be worth $16bn (\u00a310bn) by 2018. Dabbawalas are a familiar sight around Mumbai's often cramped streets - using heavily loaded bicycles to deliver about 200,000 \"tiffin\" or packed lunch boxes every day. For decades they have been using a complex coding system - using colours, numbers, letters and symbols - which has been lauded by researchers at Harvard University and recognised with the Six Sigma level of accuracy, meaning they make only one mistake in six million deliveries. 'Trusted brands' \"The dabbawalas of Mumbai are one of the most reliable and trusted brands in the city. Their unique delivery system has been smooth, reliable and has survived the test of time - even under extreme conditions,\" said Neeraj Aggarwal, Flipkart's senior director for last mile delivery. Dabbawalas will be assigned deliveries from a Flipkart hub while collecting meals from customers' homes.

The MAC's management hope the forthcoming work will protect against any further damage and provide a solution to the problem. Joe O'Neill, the chairman of the MAC, said that the venue would remain open while the work takes place. \"This work is likely to take some months and the erection of the scaffolding now will protect the building against any further damage which may happen, for example, in the event of extreme weather conditions,\" he said.

The products are competitively priced against high street stores, and there is no delivery fee. The service is an \"experiment\" limited to Washington DC at this time, but it makes them the latest in a series of tech firms to move into the sector. Amazon operates AmazonFresh, a same-day \"fresh produce and grocery\" delivery service, in California and Seattle. Google offers Shopping Express, a fast-delivery service from Whole Foods, Costco and other stores, that was launched in San Francisco and is now being expanded to New York and Los Angeles. And Instacart charges a fee to send \"personal shoppers\" to pick up and deliver a wide range of goods from selected stores promising a one or two hour turnaround. It operates in several US cities including Connecticut, Atlanta, New York and Philadelphia. One retail analyst suggested that Uber might hope to benefit from giving its drivers - who work on a freelance basis - jobs to do during quiet times of the day. However, he questioned whether the business model stacked up. \"The biggest hurdle that a lot of these delivery companies have is how can you make the economics of last-mile grocery deliveries add up?\" Stephen Mader, director of digital retail at the Kantar consultancy, told the BBC. \"On average, Uber's price points are on a par with what you would find in a physical store such as Walgreens, so what it is trying to do is take the pricing equation out of it from the shopper's perspective. \"But long-term this is most likely not going to be economically feasible unless Uber starts to figure out other ways to monetise this, through adding delivery fees or charging advertising fees to brands that take part in the programme.\" Nappies and nail polish On its blog, Uber says the Corner Store test is only set to last a few weeks, but adds: \"The more you love it, the more likely it will last.\" It is available Monday to Frid\n\nSummary:",

It's been a tough nine months and losing her has left a huge hole in our lives.\" On 23 September 2017, Mrs Isherwood went alone to the holiday complex in which she had a timeshare with ex-husband Clive. The couple, who met while in the police force, split almost 30 years ago but remained on good terms. Mr Isherwood said the couple had recently sold the time share but his ex-wife had been given vouchers for \"a final stay\". \"She would've usually gone with friends but nobody could make it during that week so she went alone,\" he said. \"We think she arrived there early on the Saturday, had gone for a swim and then gone back to the room after she'd checked in.\" Her family believe she woke in the middle of the night to use the en-suite bathroom.

If Meryl Streep owned the 2008 version playing the middle-aged beatnik Donna who had settled on a Greek island, then Lily James makes this prequel/sequel hers as the recently graduated, free-loving young Donna who goes through men quicker than Donald Trump hires special advisers. The plot is very similar to the original both in terms of quality (it's as rickety as the shack Donna does up) and storyline. This time though, its focus isn't Donna's present but her past. We meet the three young men she slept with in rapid succession, which forms the dramatic basis of both movies: anyone of them could be her daughter Sophie's dad.

Nasa started having to pay Russia to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). At the same time, however, Nasa worked with the private sector to support commercial space travel. Ever a business-savvy state, Texas is doing all it can to entice the private spaceflight industry, starting by securing its own space port. \"We are not trying to reinvent anything, but want to grow into the future of spaceflight,\" says Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership that works with Nasa to identify potential partners. \"Houston is the home of human space exploration.\" Texas has set the gold standard for attracting commercial spaceflight companies, according to industry insiders. They argue that if Texas keeps doing the right thing with economic incentives and legislation it could take the lead in a rapidly expanding market. Commercial spaceflight offers rich rewards for companies and the states within which they locate. SpaceX, for example, a pioneer in the private spaceflight industry, has more than 40 contracted launches on its schedule, including some with Nasa to resupply the ISS, which are worth $4bn (\u00a32.6bn). Longer term this commercialisation of the industry could one day bring space travel to the masses. Launching from Texas SpaceX is considering establishing one of the world's few commercial orbital launch sites on the Texas coast at Boca Chica Beach. Its Falcon 9 series of rockets are currently built in California and driven by truck to Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, from where they take supplies to the ISS. Texas has competition: Florida, Georgia and Puerto Rico are also vying to host SpaceX's new launch site. But it remains a leading candidate, according to Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind SpaceX.

He refused to confirm if Mr Magag was under surveillance when he disappeared. The government was \"reviewing this incident closely,\" he said. \"If there are practical issues that need to be considered we will consider and adopt them,\" he added. TPims - or Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security and who cannot be deported. They were brought in last year to replace control orders introduced under Labour. Those subject to TPims face restrictions, such as where they stay, who they contact, and where they travel, but differ from control orders in that suspects cannot be forced to relocate to more isolated parts of the UK. Mr Brokenshire has previously said Mr Magag's TPim was issued to prevent fundraising and overseas travel. In an urgent Commons question last month, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper asked Home Secretary Theresa May if she had \"personally made it easier\" for terror suspects to abscond by \"ditching\" relocation. \"You must not ignore the evidence on relocations now,\" Ms Cooper said. \"Isn't it time you took some responsibility and sorted this mess out?\" Mrs May denied that charge and said that, under Labour's control orders, seven terror suspects had absconded and only one of them had been found.

Late last month, the president caused outrage by suggesting the armed forces commemorate the start of military rule 55 years ago. His anti-corruption image has been tainted by allegations that his son Flavio was involved in financial scandals and death squads.

Tristram requires 24-hour-a-day supervision, as he is unable to cross a road by himself. Christine loves the young man her son has become but feels sad about the challenges he faces. She felt angry when she realized that the medication she was prescribed, sodium valproate, had known problems. Problems with sodium valproate were first identified in the 1970s, but restrictions were not placed on its use until two years ago.

And the DUP, which has opposed the deal up to now, are seeking further \"clarifications\" on the government's legal advice about the backstop - the controversial arrangement to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - and how the UK could exit it. What happened this week? A series of Brexit votes have taken place in the Commons: However, as things stand, the law has not been changed, as Wednesday and Thursday's votes were not legally binding. That means the UK is still set to leave on 29 March - with or without a deal. What are the UK's options? While legally, there does not have to be a delay, politically it might be hard for Mrs May to avoid. Thursday's motion saw Parliament agree to two options for a delay: Any delay will require the agreement of all other 27 EU members and talks about possible cond\n\nSummary:",

This was back in November 2016, when the UK business was hit by an outbreak of norovirus, otherwise known as the vomiting bug. \"A lot of the team started to get ill, and we didn't understand why,\" say Mark: \"Then suddenly we started hearing from our customers a few days later.\" In the end 200 members of staff and 160 diners were affected by the virus, and Wahaca had to temporarily close nine of its 25 sites. Not wanting employees to be out of pocket, the company continued to pay wages to everyone who was unable to work, even giving them an extra amount to compensate for the tips they were missing out on. \"It wasn't fair not to pay them,\" says Mark. Meanwhile, Thomasina sent personal apology notes to customers, embedded with wildflower seeds: \"I thought even if they throw it away, they might still get wildflowers growing in their garden.\" Mark even visited a couple in Edinburgh who were affected by the virus on their wedding day. \"I had a chat with them for half an hour. I wanted to say 'I'm so sorry'.\" The co-founders never did find out where the norovirus originated from, but believe it might have come from a supplier. \"By the time we knew what it was, it had gone through [people's] systems,\" says Mark: \"It came and went in a day, but the lasting effect was much greater.\" Financially the outbreak had a substantial impact on the business, with Wahaca saying it was responsible for a \u00a34.7m loss that financial year, compared with profits of \u00a3600,000 for the preceding 12 months. Thankfully, the company was able to recover. Within a few weeks all of the affected restaurants were able to reopen and the business returned to profitability. Today the popular chain has annual revenues of \u00a347.9m. Mark and Thomasina opened their first Wahaca restaurant in London's Covent Garden in 2007.

The 95-year-old had no surviving relatives, and was thought to have been the last British member of the Warsaw Air Bridge, in which supplies were dropped to Polish resistance fighters. Earlier this month, hundreds flocked to his funeral following an appeal for people to attend. During his service, he flew 37 missions with 178 Squadron which only ended when he was badly injured by a piece of shrapnel, losing sight in his right eye. He was awarded 20 medals by six different countries, making him one of the most highly decorated World War Two veterans. \"It's quite unusual to have that much recognition from so many countries,\" said Ailsa Gough from the RAF Association, who rallied up support for people to attend his funeral. \"But Jim just took it all in his stride and said he was just serving his country and was part of a bigger team. \"He'll be remembered not just by the Polish people, but by the UK as a whole because he was one of the last few remaining World War Two veterans who has done so much, but been very modest about what he has achieved.\" 'Be like daddy' Mr Auton, the son of an RAF officer, was destined to join the service having grown up at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. \"I was brought up on RAF stations and I didn't know any other life,\" he told the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) in a 2015 interview from his home in Louth. \"We had to walk across the aerodrome to school.

It was mostly used to heat his home. But his application suggested heat was also provided to the shed which was sometimes used for lambing and other agricultural purposes.

The tribe has grown tired of being caught in the middle of confrontations between the army and members of the Farc, Colombia's largest rebel group. The army has moved its men temporarily to avoid further clashes, and General Alejandro Navas has confirmed that the soldiers are still on the mountain where they were based, but have moved further down its slope. Local media have described how some 1,000 Nasa surrounded the army post and grabbed one of the soldiers, carrying him 10m (35 feet) down the mountain. A soldier fired into the air to disperse the Nasa, who in turn threw soil at the armed forces. The Nasa say 250 of them will stay on the top of the mountain to prevent the soldiers from returning. Tension between the security forces and the indigenous groups around Toribio, in Cauca province, have been growing for the past week. After days of attacks by Farc rebels on the police station in Toribio, the Nasa demanded the security forces and the rebels take their fight elsewhere. They dismantled trenches erected by the security forces. They also marched on a rebel camp in the mountains and told the Farc to leave. Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon has warned that the security forces would stay in the area and continue fighting the Farc. He has said that the government would continue dealing with the indigenous population through \"dialogue and respect\", but warned them not to break the law. The steep mountainous area is a Farc stronghold and a key corridor for the trafficking of cocaine.

Army commander General Alejandro Navas said the soldiers were still on the mountain where they were based, but had moved further down its slope. Local media described how some 1,000 Nasa surrounded the army post, grabbed one of the soldiers and carried him 10m (35 feet) down the mountain. A soldier fired into the air to disperse the Nasa, who in turn threw soil at the armed forces. The Nasa say 250 of them will stay on the top of the mountain to prevent the soldiers from returning. Tension between the security forces and the indigenous groups around Toribio, in Cauca province, have been growing for the past week. After days of attacks by Farc rebels on the police station in Toribio, the Nasa demanded the security forces and the rebels take their fight elsewhere. They dismantled trenches erected by the security forces. They also marched on a rebel camp in the mountains and told the Farc to leave. Key corridor Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said the security forces would stay in the area and continue fighting the Farc. Mr Pinzon said the government would continue dealing with the indigenous population through \"dialogue and respect\", but warned them not to break the law. The steep mountainous area is a Farc stronghold and a key corridor for the trafficking of cocaine. Indigenous groups say they are bearing the brunt of the fighting between the government forces and the rebels. They say the presence of the security forces attracts the rebels, whose mortars often miss their intended targets and kill civilians. They want to assume control of the area and guard it themselves.\n\nSummary:",

The Appellate Body has the final say on disputes that cover billions of dollars of international trade and its decisions are supposed to be binding. However, now that it has ceased to function and can't take on new cases Mr Azevedo conceded that \"significant changes in the dispute settlement mechanism\" will be needed and that \"intensive consultations\" will start immediately. These are likely to include \"looking at issues like how fast can the disputes settlement work\", he said in a BBC interview Those changes are being demanded by President Trump's administration in Washington. Their argument is that the WTO has treated the United States unfairly. Some of their criticisms are shared by other countries but others are not. Despite this Mr Azevedo says that Donald Trump's tenure as US president is not a barrier to reaching a solution. \"It's whether we can find fixes that everybody can live with\". He adds that, \"these are extremely complex conversations and negotiations and very political in nature, so we have to understand this is not something that is going to be solved overnight, just like that\". Mr Trump's role is disputed by Professor James Bacchus, a former chairman, or chief judge, of the WTO Appellate Body as well as a former US trade negotiator.

Going private would allow the company to reorganise its business without the pressure of shareholder scrutiny. Blackberry has been losing money after failing to keep up with its rivals. Last month the company's chief executive said that Blackberry was on the right and track, but needed more time to fix its problems. If Blackberry decided to go private it would have to find partners who could raise the billions of dollars need to buy out existing shareholders. That could prove difficult as the company has been struggling. In its most recent quarter, Blackberry lost $84m (\u00a354m) and expects to lose more money in the three months to the end of August. Blackberry launched two all-new smartphones this year, the touchscreen Z10 device, followed by the Q10, with a mini keyboard favoured by many Blackberry users.

Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nAmol RajanMedia editor It was a year ago that, on a visit to Rome to see the Pope, he said \"We are a tech company, not a media company\". Then, in December, he appeared to soften his language, saying \"It's not a traditional media company. You know, we build technology and we feel responsible for how it's used.\" In a blog post in December I argued that Zuckerberg's firm was indeed a media company, because it is funded by advertising, creates vast amounts of stories (or content), and is the main source of news for millions - if not billions - around the world. Today, with the launch of Facebook Watch, a video service that will incentivise the creation of a new industry in original programming, the tech giant is moving into broadcasting in a big way. It is becoming a destination for viewers of programmes. That, of course, makes it a media company; but qualifying for that label isn't a matter for pedants alone. This is about more than semantics: it's about Facebook's ambition, social obligations, and the future of media itself. Vast ambition It is actually quite hard to fathom the financial power of Facebook today. Despite warnings last year about a limit to how many ads users will tolerate on their news feed, the company is able to charge brands ever more for the privilege of appearing there. Its market capitalisation now nudges $500bn; advertising revenues are up 47%; and earnings by GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) have hit $4bn - growing by a scarcely comprehensible 70% in a year, from a very strong base. Mix that kind of growth and wealth with the Silicon Valley mindset - \"move fast and break things\" - and you get a sense of why Facebook has decided to move into original programming, giving the makers of videos that appear on its platform a juicy 55% of ad revenues - for now at least. This is all about making the Facebook experience ever more sticky: making users want to spend more and more, and more and more time within the walled garden - or echo ch\n\nSummary:",

The party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the Conservatives of stabbing Scotland in the back with Brexit legislation. But Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said people want the UK's governments to work together. He told MPs the government was adhering to the principles of devolution by pushing ahead with the withdrawal bill, despite Holyrood refusing its backing. Mr Lidington said the package was a compromise and balanced. Lord Sewel Earlier Lord Sewel, one of the authors of the devolution settlement, has backed the UK government's view. Under the Sewel convention, Westminster does not normally legislate on devolved matters without Holyrood's approval. After MPs moved to do this with the EU Withdrawal Bill, Nicola Surgeon said the convention had been \"ripped up\". Lord Sewel said the \"size and scale\" of Brexit as an issue meant Westminster must be able to act \"on initiative\". And he said the situation was \"not a constitutional crisis\", suggesting that some parties were using the row to \"seek political advantage\". Live: devolution debate at Westminster Last week, MSPs voted by a margin of 93 to 30 not to give Holyrood's consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill following a row over how powers currently exercised from Brussels would be used after Brexit. MPs opted to proceed with the bill, although only minutes were available for discussion of devolved powers during the final debate in the Commons - prompting SNP MPs to walk out of the House of Commons in protest during Prime Minister's Questions the following day. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Sewel convention had been \"ripped up\" by the UK government, saying Scotland had been \"treated with utter contempt\". She said: \"Our interests have been ignored, the voice and views of the Scottish Parliament have been completely cast aside, and I don't think it will be quickly or easily forgotten.\" However, Lord Sew\n\nSummary:",

After noticing blood in her stools in the summer of 2018, Mrs Hewitt was first prescribed cream for haemorrhoids. \"It was persistent, it would stop for about a week and then after a week it would carry on again,\" she said. Despite having no other symptoms associated with bowel cancer, as time passed the occupational therapist became worried the blood was an indicator of something more serious. \"I think I went back to (my GP) about five or six times... they were just saying, 'no you're too young for anything like cancer',\" said Mrs Hewitt. \"I'd think 'they're going to think I'm a bit mad because I'm worrying about nothing',\" she added. After securing a private referral Mrs Hewitt had a colonoscopy and scans to confirm the diagnosis, something she described as \"a relief\". About 18cm (7in) of her bowel was removed during surgery and further investigations revealed no further treatment was required, she said.

Hereford Medical Group, which runs two of the surgeries visited by Mrs Hewitt, said it was unable to comment on individual cases relating to patients, but hoped the story would \"increase awareness\". \"If any patient has concerns about an initial diagnosis or if symptoms persist, return following treatment, or change, we would urge them to contac\n\nSummary:",

Jack Birtwistle and Henry Clark, both 25 and from the town, have each been given a conditional caution. They were ordered to carry out 150 hours of \"pretty hard graft\" repair works, Lancashire Police said. Blackburn and Darwen Police said on Facebook that the pair would \"put right some of the damage\" and see how the moorland was \"still trying to recover\". A spokesman said Birtwistle, of Marsham Grove, and Henry Clark, of Epworth Street, had \"admitted their guilt for reckless arson before their court appearance\". He said they had admitted that \"taking a disposable barbecue onto the grassy moors and lighting it without having regard for the clear warnings on the packaging or consideration that the grass may ignite was a reckless act, rather than a mere accidental fire\". A Blackburn Magistrates' Court spokeswoman said the arson offence had been withdrawn and the defendants had signed an acceptance of conditional caution. Reparation work will include removing burnt fencing and footbridges, assisting dry stone wall repairs, and planting species of rare plants.

Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nBy Mark WardTechnology correspondent, BBC News If you are wondering why, it is largely because so many popular websites and services (Facebook, Twitter and Google to name but three) use the colour in their logo. That has a subtle impact on the choices people make when signing up and picking a word or phrase to form a supposedly super-secret password. It's just one of the many quirks to be found in the password-picking habits of us humans. There are plenty of others. For example studies suggest red-haired women tend to choose the best passwords and men with bushy beards or unkempt hair, the worst. These studies also reveal that when it comes to passwords, women prefer length and men diversity. Big data These facts have come to light thanks to the vast number of passwords that have been stolen from websites and online services, says security researcher Per Thorsheim. Adobe, LinkedIn and game website RockYou have all been hit in breaches that involved the theft of login names and passwords. Add to this the steady drip of security breaches at other firms and you have a vast corpus of data that can shed light on what passwords people pick. The number one conclusion from looking at that data - people are lousy at picking good passwords. \"You have to remember we are all human and we all make mistakes,\" says Mr Thorsheim. In this sense, he says, a good password would be a phrase or combination of characters that has little or no connection to the person picking it. All too often, Mr Thorsheim adds, people use words or numbers intimately linked to them. They use birthdays, wedding days, the names of siblings or children or pets. They use their house number, street name or pick on a favourite pop star. This bias is most noticeable when it comes to the numbers people pick when told to choose a four digit pin. Analysis of their choices suggests that people drift towards a small subset of the 10,000 available. In some cases, up to 80% of choices come from just 100 different numb\n\nSummary:",

The Welsh government's target is to treat all patients within nine months. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh NHS was \"under pressure\" but stressed it was not \"in crisis\". He told BBC Wales: \"There are fewer people waiting overall in the Welsh NHS than before. \"The number of people waiting over 26 weeks has come down but I am disappointed to see the rise in people waiting over 36 weeks. \"I've made it clear to local health boards, even in the difficult period over the winter, I expect them to concentrate on those longer waiters and I do expect to see those figures coming down.\" 'Increasingly worsening crisis' Official figures also show 88% of people waited less than 26 weeks to start treatment. The target is 95%. Mr Drakeford said it was up to the local health boards to manage the situation and speeding up waiting times \"has to be the priority\" for the Welsh NHS. But Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar described the situation as an \"increasingly worsening crisis\". \"The minister's only answer is to review his own targets.

The more I heard about it, the more I wanted to do it,\" George says. \"I'm quite stubborn. I didn't want to look back and regret anything.\" Months of careful planning and years of saving funds followed. 'Alone' In the meantime he founded a website, shift.ms , for young people with the neurological condition, because he felt alone and isolated in those early days. A grant from the Wellcome Trust to improve communication between MS researchers and young MS sufferers followed. As a result, a busy online forum and a real community of friends has now built up around the website, which has become a valuable support network for young people. Before George set off on his world tour he had another relapse, losing his hearing in one ear for eight weeks. He also had co-ordination issues, kept losing his balance and felt extremely tired.

Mr Mackay said he had \"behaved foolishly\" and took full responsibility for his actions. He also apologised \"unreservedly\" to the boy and his family. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not know about Mr Mackay's \"unacceptable\" behaviour until Wednesday evening, and is \"not aware of any further allegations\" against him.

Police Scotland said it had not received any complaint of criminality, but was \"assessing available information from media information\". The force also asked for anyone with any information to contact them. Interim Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw called on Mr Mackay to also stand down from the Scottish Parliament, saying his behaviour could \"constitute the grooming of a young individual\". And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mr Mackay's actions had been \"an abuse of power\" and \"nothing short of predatory\".

To be amply clear, there is no such vacancy at present. But all of this comes amid an amalgam of challenges for the Scottish government and the SNP.

He has made one of the most remarkable recoveries ever seen by doctors at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN) in London. His first stroke happened while he was in intensive care at University College Hospital. Potentially deadly blood clots were also found in his lungs and legs, so he was put on powerful blood-thinning (anticoagulant) drugs. A couple of days later he suffered a second, even bigger stroke and was immediately transferred to the NHNN in Queen Square. Consultant neurologist Dr Arvind Chandratheva was just leaving hospital when the ambulance arrived. \"Paul had a blank expression on his face,\" he says. \"He could only see on one side and he couldn't figure out how to use his phone or remember his passcode. \"I immediately thought that the blood thinners had caused a bleed in the brain, but what we saw was so strange and different.\" Paul had suffered another acute stroke due to a clot, depriving vital areas of the brain of blood supply. Tests showed that he had astonishingly high levels of a marker for the amount of clotting in the blood known as D-dimer. Normally these are less than 300, and in stroke patients can rise to 1,000.

He said: \"This type of behaviour has undoubtedly eroded the women's trust and confidence in policing. \"The officer's behaviour was absolutely unacceptable, damaging to our reputation and will not be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police or the communities we serve.\" The force sacked a different officer in 2019 for having a sexual relationship with a domestic abuse survivor. IOPC regional director Catrin Evans said the officer failed \"to show sufficient regard for the professional boundaries he must observe in his role as an officer\" and \"failed to fulfil his public duty by carrying out investigations into the crimes reported\". The IOPC said a referral was made to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which decided not to charge the officer with any criminal offence.\n\nSummary:",

But the sci-fi, starring Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey, took first place in the global box office rundown. Ouija and Nightcrawler, last week's joint number one, fell to four and six. It is only the fourth time in US box office history that two films have opened with $50m or above, according to experts Rentrak. Senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that Big Hero 6 and Interstellar \"were both able to do well without cannibalising each other's audiences\". \"It's a perfect example of counterprogramming. It paid off for the industry, and it just doesn't happen that often,\" he added. Despite that, Mr Dergarabedian said the US box office had slipped 7% compared to the same weekend last year. Interstellar, the latest film by Dark Knight and Inception director Christopher Nolan, which tells the story of astronauts who are searching for a habitable planet after the Earth is decimated by dust storms, cost $165m (\u00a3103m) to make. It has inevitably been compared to last year's starry space epic Gravity, which had a bigger box office haul in its opening week. The movie is likely to enjoy a further worldwide sales boost when it opens in China on Wednesday, while its makers have said they will target families and young men in a bid to sustain its ticket sales. Walt Disney's head of distribution, Dave Hollis, said of Big Hero 6's success that \"you need to transcend the family audience in order to a get a number like this\".\n\nSummary:",

The jobs will be in the areas of technology and software development, and they will offer an average salary of \u00a333,000. The First Minister, Arlene Foster, said that the jobs will contribute \u00a310 million in salaries to the local economy, and that they are a \"vote of confidence\" in the Northern Ireland workforce. The Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, also welcomed the announcement, and said that the new jobs will offer excellent opportunities for graduate and experienced IT professionals, as well as school leavers. Invest Northern Ireland has offered Tullett Prebon over \u00a32 million towards the creation of the new jobs, and the Department for the Economy's Assured Skills programme has provided \u00a3400,000 for associated training. The announcement of 300 jobs is the largest that the Northern Ireland executive has been able to unveil in ten months, and it continues Belfast's track record of attracting well-paid jobs in the financial services sector.

Analysis: BBC NI business correspondent Julian O'Neill The announcement of 300 jobs is the largest the Northern Ireland executive has been able to unveil in ten months. It continues Belfast's track record of attracting well paid jobs in the financial services sector. Negotiations about the jobs took a year to conclude and were set in motion long before the EU referendum, the outcome of which did not torpedo an important inward investment. The executive and Invest NI are very keen to project a business-as-usual message and this announcement aids that narrative. But beneath the surface, the DUP and Sinn Fein are deeply at odds over what a Brexit future holds for the local economy. Tuesday's announcement will be welcomed all round, but nothing can really be read into its wider significance vis-\u00e0-vis Brexit and whether that will disadvantage Northern Ireland's chance of inward investment. Luke Barnett, of Tullett Prebon, said: \"We are delighted to announce the launch of our technology centre in Northern Ireland. \"We looked at many potential locations and Belfast was the outstanding choice. \"The combination of a h\n\nSummary:",
