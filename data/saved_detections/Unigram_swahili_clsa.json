government of Honduras announced that two soldiers will ride each bus in the capital and second city of the country to combat crime and ensure the safety of the public. President Porfirio Lobo said the move would free police officers for street patrols in crime-ridden neighborhoods. Public buses in Honduras are frequently attacked by gangs who rob passengers and extort money from drivers. The government began deploying troops on the streets last year in response to a public outcry over violent crime and the failure of the police to ensure security. Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, according to the UN, with much of the killing linked to drug-trafficking. President Lobo again blamed the international drug trade for the violence afflicting his country and said the government's misfortune lies in being a transit point for South American cocaine being smuggled to the US.","1":"Government reforms in 2012 pledged to cut down \"out-of-borough placements\" to help combat child sexual exploitation. Labour MP Ann Coffey used a Commons debate to say a \"sent-away generation\" is in danger of falling prey to paedophiles and drugs gangs. The government said placements \"should meet the needs of children\". Stockport MP Ms Coffey - chair of the all party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children and adults - said there had been a 64% rise nationally in the number of children being sent to live away between 2012 and 2017. Figures obtained by Ms Coffey from the Department for Education show the number of children placed in homes out of their borough has risen from 2,250 in 2012 to 3,680 in March 2017. 'Physical abuse' Ms Coffey said some children were being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live \"where they have no friends or family circles or local social workers\", creating a \"perfect storm where it is increasingly difficult to protect [them]\". \"Despite the [government] pledge, record numbers of children are being sent away to places where they are more vulnerable to exploitation,\" she added. \"These children are running away at a faster rate and are being targeted and preyed upon by paedophiles and criminals who know they are vulnerable.\" The MP said there had also been a huge increase in the number of sent-away children going missing, with the number of incidents more than doubling to almost 10,000 a year. Children's charity the NSPCC said going missing from care \"puts children at greater risk of physical abuse, grooming and sexual exploitation\". A Department for Education spokesman said it was updating its strategy to improve responses to missing people and strengthening its care planning and children's homes regulation to require all homes to have a \"clear policy for preventing children from going missing\". \"Local authorities have a statutory duty to make sure that placements meet the needs of children in their care and this includes ensuring children are not placed too far from home or family support networks.\" The spokesman said the government's \"ambitious\" programme of action would ensure young people were better protected and the department would \"be looking closely at","2":"The Duke of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cornwall were in Cornwall for a royal visit.

Cymdeithas yr Iaith argues that the council's plans are based on \"worn out\" arguments and that the council wants high standards and does not rush. However, the council states that it wants high standards and does not rush. A report being considered by the committee on Monday highlights the cost per pupil and a backlog of repairs at all three schools. It also mentions the lower than expected standards at Ysgol Henblas and Ysgol Bodffordd. The report recommends either building a new school to replace all three schools or building a school to replace Ysgol Bodffordd and Ysgol Corn Hir and keeping Ysgol Henblas in its current form or as a multi-site school. The committee will consider the options and make a recommendation on the future of the schools. However, the Welsh language group points to the changes in the School Organisation Code, which will mean that rural schools will be officially designated and listed, making closures the last resort. Authorities will need to evaluate the likelihood of a school's closure having an effect on the education of children, the wider community and travel arrangements and explain why a school's closure would be the \"most appropriate\" action. A consultation ended in September 2017 and the plans are currently being reviewed. Referring to this, Cymdeithas yr Iaith addressed a letter of appeal to the education minister. They said: \"We wish to bring to your attention the fact that education officials in Ynys M\u00f4n are trying to force a proposal to close the Bodffordd and Henblas schools before the new Code comes into force. \"They use the same old generic arguments that would result in the closure of every rural school on your list if dogmatically adhered to.\" In response, an Anglesey council spokesman said: \"We are aware of the possible changes to the School Organisation Code and act on the content. \"As part of this, community, language and travel considerations are key factors for all school closures and we will continue to take them into account and explain the reasons for closures.\"","4":"The article discusses the report of the venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft on boosting the economy of the UK.

The article provides details about the events leading up to the death of one of the reservists, Corporal James Dunsby. Dunsby's body temperature was recorded as 40.4 degrees Celsius, which is well above the normal body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. Dunsby died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham 17 days after the exercise. Another two of the reservists, Lance Corporals Craig Roberts and Edward Maher, died during the exercise and were transported to a nearby hospital where Maher died about three hours after the exercise. The article describes the scene of the exercise and provides details about the temperature and weather conditions at the time of the event. The article quotes a clinical team leader from the Welsh Ambulance Service who said he did not think Dunsby would survive and that he initially thought there were three people \"on the hill\" in cardiac arrest. The article also provides details about an unnamed walker who was asked by an Army officer to fan down Dunsby, hold his head and watch his breathing while four other soldiers carried him on a stretcher from the hillside.

Unite Against Fascism (UAF) argues that Oxford Union's invitation to Marine Le Pen is equivalent to \"targeting fascists\" and that the invitation would give a prestigious platform to racists and Islamophobes, thus contributing to the rise of racism and fascism. In response, the Oxford Union President Lisa Wehden argues that the Union is a \"politically-neutral\" organization and an invitation does not necessarily endorse the agenda of the speaker. Moreover, the far-right French National Front party led by Ms. Le Pen is the third-largest party in France. In an interview, Ms. Le Pen said that the Union's invitation shows \"intellectual courage\" and she is \"prepared for a real debate\" and will not \"resort to the language of insults and violence\" as some of the Union's members had done in the past. In another interview, the Oxford Union President said the Union's invitation reflects the \"principle of freedom of speech\" and the Union encourages members who oppose the views of the speaker to attend the event and question the speaker. Mr. Tanner, a local councillor and Labour party supporter, argues that the Union's invitation is an \"irresponsible stunt\" and a \"contradiction\" of the Union's claim of \"intellectual and moral courage\" and \"democratic values\" as the Union's invitation would give a \"prestigious platform\" to fascists and racists. Mr. Tanner also points out the danger of the rise of fascism and racism and argues that the Union's invitation will \"encourage\" racists and Islamophobes and lead to the \"persecution\" of the Muslims and the \"discrimination\" of the ethnic minorities. In a statement, the Oxford Union states that the Union encourages all members who oppose the views of the speaker to attend the event and question the speaker and the Union allows members \"to meet people face-to-face and make up their own minds\" and the Union \"will not censor or suppress opinions\" and \"will defend the rights of all speakers and members of the Union to speak and hear views of","8":"11-year-old girl named Moira Anderson went missing in Scotland in 1957 after running an errand for her family during a blizzard. Despite decades of appeals and investigations, the case remained cold until 1999 when a child abuser named James Gallogley claimed that the missing girl's body was buried in an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery and that his former friend and paedophile Alexander Gartshore was the murderer. Gartshore died in 2006 and his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira's, published a book in which she accused Gartshore of the schoolgirl's murder and said he initially buried the body in a ditch before moving it to the cemetery. In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot of a former acquaintance of Gartshore's named Sinclair Upton found anomalies in the soil that were consistent with another body being buried there. In 2012, Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, granted permission for the grave of Mr Upton to be exhumed and for a DNA analysis to be conducted on the remains. Sandra Brown and Moira's sister Janet Hart launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed and a DNA analysis conducted. In September 2013, police launched an investigation into the case and were given permission to exhume the grave of Mr Upton at the cemetery. In December 2013, police revealed that a number of bones and bone fragments were found at the burial site of Mr Upton and DNA analysis of the remains will determine whether or not the bones are human and if a match can be made with the DNA of Gartshore or the remains of the missing girl. In January 2014, police announced that the bones and bone fragments were from a human body and the analysis of the DNA would determine if the remains were of Gartshore or the missing schoolgirl. In March 2014, the remains of a girl were uncovered from the grave of Mr Upton and the DNA analysis of the remains were matched to that of Gartshore. Police believe Gartshore may have moved the body of the missing girl from the ditch where he initially buried the body and dumped the remains at the cemetery","9":"The article focuses on the restoration of the interior and historic collections of a famed 18th Century mansion in County Down, Ireland. Neil Watt and Kris Reid spent most of the year restoring the mansion's interior and historic collections. With no visitors allowed for most of the year, the couple set about meticulously restoring some of the manor's interior and historic collections. Neil, the newly-appointed collections and house manager, moved into the top floor of the mansion in March and was preparing to welcome thousands to the National Trust property when coronavirus hit. With both men experienced conservationists - Neil has a PhD in Irish country houses and Kris is studying for a PhD in heritage - they instead set about giving everything from the chandeliers to the kitchen utensils a new lease of life. First there was the installation of a new dehumidifying system to address a centuries-old damp problem. Then they set about cleaning and cataloguing the house's collection of 2,000 books, most dating from the 18th Century. Castle Ward also boasts one of the finest sets of cooking pots and pans on the island of Ireland, but over the centuries it had become blackened and tarnished. The couple polished the 100 pieces one by one. They did the same with many other fixtures and fittings, including all the brass door handles. The good weather in the early summer allowed them to clean the antique window blinds and beat down the luxury carpets and rugs. There was also the delicate job of cleaning the crystal Victorian chandeliers. A new architectural story Neil, who is originally from County Tyrone, said in any other year the jobs would not have been doable. \"You only have so many hours in the day and if the house is open from 11am until 5pm you can't do all this work in front of the public, because it would detract from their experience.\" The tasks were not all practical.

The measures aim to \"break the homelessness cycle once and for all\", the government said. Labour dismissed the initiative as a \"pitiful response to a national crisis\". But Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC he was \"absolutely committed\" to reducing homelessness. \"People can look at ministers like me and say 'are they really going to do this?'\" Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast. \"Judge us by the actual actions and this is real action that is going to help people.\" Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler has said she would resign if the problem of rough sleeping worsens while she is in office.

A spokesperson for the estate that owns the land confirmed that a staff member had spoken with the travelers. The travelers claimed they were just passing through for the summer and were not trying to settle permanently. A liaison officer from the local government visited the travelers and stated they appeared to be legitimate and were just traveling along the south coast for the summer. The travelers' presence at the village sparked controversy and concerns about the impact on the local community and the environment. The article does not explicitly mention whether the travelers were granted permission to stay or whether the authorities took any action to remove them from the village.","38":"The economic crisis has moved from the stress indicators of global stock markets to the real world. Market indices have stopped falling so fast (\"too late to sell, too early to buy\" was one investor's observation). We are now getting a sense of the scale of job losses. The tourist industry was hit hard with the denial of two big earners as far away as August in the Edinburgh festivals (cancelled) and the COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November (postponed). That underlined the heightened level of exposure for hospitality and tourism, and was a signal of how long this is going to affect the economy. Unemployment surge The most startling numbers were from the US. One way of measuring unemployment in the States is by the number of people who register each week. In Britain, we don't have data that responds that fast. The US figure the week before last was up by 3.3m, more than four times the previous one-week record. This week, that was up to 6.6m. A lot of worklessness - that is, having nothing to do - is mitigated by the UK government pouring money into job retention schemes, both for the employed and the self-employed. That may be a much bigger number than the government thought it would be. A lot of employers are turning to that as a means to keep people on their books, and to handle the sudden drying up of cash flow. Furlough for long? Can we be sure those put on furlough will return to work? Not if employers are seeing it as a stepping stone to redundancy. A downturn like this is an opportunity for companies to shake out inefficiencies. The jobs market has been very volatile recently and we need a strong economic recovery to bring people back into the labour market and increase people's confidence in the economy.\n\nThis is a short answer exam-style question and the marker will expect you to answer each of the following questions in one paragraph each as follows: What does the article say about the impact of the economic crisis?

LTNs were introduced by some councils as a way to reduce car ownership and increase cycling and walking, while congestion levels have reached pre-lockdown levels and are expected to exceed them in the near future. While the schemes have received both support and opposition from residents, they have sparked a debate over the effectiveness of LTNs in reducing congestion and improving air quality. One of the key issues with LTNs is the lack of consultation with residents before their implementation, as some were put in place without warning, leading to frustration and anger among local communities. Despite the controversy surrounding LTNs, some residents support them as a way to reduce car ownership and improve air quality. However, the debate around LTNs highlights the need for better consultation and a more balanced approach when implementing transport schemes in local communities. Overall, the article provides an insight into the debate around LTNs and the implications for local communities and transport policy in London and beyond.\n\nMake sure the article you choose can be read for free- some sites need subscriptions and I can't post the article without a citation and link back to the original article...\n\n(The article must be at least one year old)\n\n##### Do you need a similar assignment done for you from scratch?

Researchers used declassified French military documents, calculations and testimonies to reconstruct the impact of a number of the tests and estimated that around 110,000 people were affected by the radioactive fallout of the tests. They found that the number of people affected represented \"almost the entire\" population at the time of the tests. French Polynesia, a French territory made up of hundreds of islands and atolls including Tahiti, was the site of dozens of nuclear tests over 30 years. Over the course of two years, researchers analysed around 2,000 documents released by the French military and recreated the impact of \"the most contaminating\" of France's nuclear tests carried out between 1966 and 1974. They found that the radiation from the French tests was between two and 10 times higher than estimates given by France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in a 2006 report. One reason for the discrepancy was that the CEA \"did not always take into account the drinking of contaminated rainwater\" when calculating the dose of radiation individuals were likely to have been exposed to. Catherine Serda, a former resident of French Polynesia, said that eight members of her family contracted cancer and that the high rate of cancer in the area was not normal and that the tests were responsible for the high rate of cancer. The article states that the CEA report was used as the basis for determining whether people were eligible for compensation from the French government for the harm caused by the tests. The article concludes that the French military tests had a significant impact on the population of French Polynesia and that the government should compensate those affected by the tests.\n\nThe article I chose for the assignment is an investigation into the French military tests conducted in French Polynesia from 1966 to 1974.

Lucy Fallon, who plays Bethany Platt in Coronation Street, and the plot of her abusive relationship with Nathan will both be nominated for awards. The plotline sees the teenage schoolgirl sexually exploited and used to sleep with strangers by Nathan, played by Christopher Harper. After luring her into a relationship and persuading her to move in with him, viewers have seen him tell her she was responsible for the theft of a friend's camera equipment. He then makes her believe the only way to make up for it was for her to sleep with his friend - and the storyline is expected to continue for some time to come.

However, some viewers have complained it is too harrowing to be shown before the watershed.","58":"The Space Launch System (SLS) rocket is a key component of Nasa's Moon exploration plan, known as Artemis. In late March 2021, Nasa's core stage for the SLS was fully loaded with propellant for the first time at the Nasa's Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis in Mississippi. This was part of a testing programme known as the Green Run, which involves eight tests on the core stage. In the latest test, known as the wet dress rehearsal (WDR), the core stage was loaded with liquid hydrogen and oxygen for the first time, and the propellant was controlled and drained. This enabled engineers to check whether the rocket responded as expected before the SLS makes its maiden flight. The wet dress rehearsal was the seventh of eight tests on the core stage. However, the test ended earlier than planned due to an unexpected shutdown. Despite this, the completion of the WDR should set up the eighth and final test - a \"hotfire\" where all four RS-25 engines at the base of the core will be fired together for the first time. This very rocket segment will loft the first mission in Nasa's Moon exploration plan - known as Artemis - and will send the next-generation Orion spacecraft on a loop around Earth's only natural satellite. There will be no crew aboard for this test flight. But the third Artemis mission, in 2024, will land the first humans on the lunar surface since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The Green Run helps ensure that any issues are ironed out before the complex rocket segment is transported to Florida to prepare it for launch. Over the course of several hours, the core stage was loaded with more than 700,000 gallons (roughly 2.6 million litres) of liquid hydrogen and oxygen. This enabled Nasa's core stage for the SLS to be fully loaded with propellant for the first time at the Nasa's Stennis Space Center, and sets the stage for the final test of the Green Run programme - a \"hotfire\" where all four RS-25 engines at the base of the core will be fired together for the first time - before the SLS makes its maiden flight and lofts the","59":"1.\nSome of Jeremy Corbyn's opponents feel that the opinion polls are fairly accurate and the best way to survive the next month or so as a general election approaches is to keep a safe distance from the party leader.\n2.\nA former minister stated \"I don't want him anywhere near my seat - they should send him to areas we won't win\".\n3.\nA senior Labour figure said the party's local election performance was \"calamitous\".\n4.\nSome of Mr Corbyn's supporters fear another attempted putsch by his internal opponents.\n5.\nMany of those who are sceptical about his leadership say there is no obvious mechanism to remove him - and he would use any evidence of a plot to excuse a bad general election result.\n6.\nThe former Labour group leader in Derbyshire saw control of his council pass to the Conservatives today.\n7.\nHe stated he wouldn't call for Jeremy Corbyn's resignation right now - but if Labour were to suffer a similar defeat nationally on 8 June, the party leader should go.\n8.\nThe party's mayoral candidate in the West Midlands, Sion Simon - close to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson - chose to focus not on the party leader to explain his defeat.\n9.\nHe said he got \"the sense that some of our voters don't have confidence any more that we share their core Labour values\".\n10.\nHowever, Mr Corbyn's allies blame a collapse in the UKIP vote, as well as previous attempts by some of his own MPs to undermine him and his leadership.\n11.\nThe party will need a stronger leader if it wants to win the general election in June.\n12.\nThe local election results show that the party's leadership is not strong enough to win the election and that a stronger leader will be needed if the party wants to win the election in June.\n13.\nThe party will need a stronger leader if it wants to win the general election in June.\n14.\nThe local election results show that the party's leadership is not strong enough to win the election and that a stronger leader will be needed if the party wants to win the election in June.\n15.\nThe party will need a stronger leader if it wants to win the general election in June.\n1","60":"The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) has stated that if driving instructors become sexually involved with 16 and 17-year-old pupils, even if it's consensual, they could face being punished. In 2016-17 there were 109 investigations into instructor misconduct, which includes inappropriate sexual behaviour. Instructors could be removed from the approved register if they're found to be \"a high risk\". In a recent Newsbeat report, a learner driver revealed her experience of sexual comments and suggestive behaviour from her driving instructor. In response, the government announced a review of the laws to better protect young drivers from \"predatory instructors\". The review includes the potential for greater protection for young drivers from grooming and sexual abuse. The DVSA stated that it would investigate serious allegations of improper behaviour and refer its findings to the police. Inappropriate conduct includes the use of sexualised language, unnecessary physical or inappropriate contact, and the sending of indecent messages or images to a learner driver. The government has announced an investigation into the issue of sexual impropriety within the driving industry, with a focus on the protection of young drivers. The investigation will review the existing laws and regulations and make recommendations for improvements where necessary. The government will also be seeking the advice of the police and other relevant organisations to ensure the safety of all drivers, and particularly young drivers who are often at greater risk of sexual abuse and grooming. The investigation will look into the potential for greater protection for young drivers from sexual abuse and improper behaviour, as well as the potential for better training and education for driving instructors to ensure a safer and more professional environment for both instructors and learners.

The firms had said the merger would create an industrial champion on a par with global players, but the commission said the deal would not result in sufficient remedies for competition concerns. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the decision would \"serve the interests of China\" and would make it harder for Europe to compete globally. In response, the two firms submitted proposals to address the Commission's concerns and the deal would have created an entity with revenues of approximately \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) with significant operations across Europe's rail network. But China's state owned railway behemoth CRRC, the largest global player, has been competing more aggressively for overseas contracts in recent years. Those supporting the deal, including government ministers in both France and Germany said the commission should look beyond Europe in sectors such as transport and banking and change the rules. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin and Paris were working on a proposal to change European competition rules and make them more competitive globally.

Mr Attwood said he would not support the proposed changes to planning law. The SDLP member added that he did not think OFMDFM should act as a \"planning authority\". The economic zones are due to be debated as part of proposed amendments to Mr Attwood's forthcoming planning bill, due before the Stormont assembly on Monday. Legal challenges BBC Northern Ireland's political editor, Mark Devenport, said: \"This follows on from one clause in the economic pact agreed between Downing Street and the executive, which talked about the executive establishing a new process for economically significant planning applications.\" The clause also makes reference to the executive \"making new arrangements in relation to applications for judicial review of planning decisions\". The DUP and Sinn Fein have both signed up to an amendment that would create economically significant planning zones, within which planning permission \"may be unconditional, or subject to various conditions, specified in a scheme drawn up by OFMDFM\". The proposed changes to planning law follow a number of high profile legal challenges, or judicial reviews, of controversial planning decisions.

Roy Whitney of Unite the union said sites in Port Talbot and Porth would come under the spotlight in the autumn. The UK government says the \u00a3320m budget for disabled employment services could be spent more effectively. The Welsh factories are among 27 Remploy sites which will close. Two other sites which were at risk - Bridgend and Croespenmaen in Caerphilly county - will remain open. Mr Whitney, who has been working at Remploy for 29 years, said even though the Port Talbot and Porth sites were not earmarked for closure, the UK government would look at them in the autumn. \"We were led to believe that they would not look at our situation until at least April 2013, so it's not too good for those sites (Port Talbot and Porth), said Mr Whitney. \"Again now we have this uncertainty hanging over the disabled people in Remploy, which we've had hanging over us for the last four years and it's not doing morale any good at all. \"There's a lot of people in this country who don't really understand how Remploy work. \"We hear things, such as, we work in a ghetto and we should be out in mainstream employment - Remploy is mainstream employment. \"Don't forget, we are not only disabled people working in Remploy, we have fit people working in Remploy.\" The closure of five of Wales' seven Remploy factories is a \"hammer blow\" for workers, says the Welsh government.

Inadequate staffing levels and a lack of resources contributed to the death of the young inmate, leading to an ongoing investigation at the Coroner's Court in Milton Keynes. At the time of the incident, Ms. Rance's healthcare team consisted of one full-time nurse, another part-time nurse, a psychiatrist for a portion of the week, and herself, leaving them unable to manage the sheer volume of patients effectively. Furthermore, the jury at the inquest heard evidence suggesting that the staff's failure to attend to the young man's well-being contributed to his tragic demise. During his time at the correctional facility, Mr. Harvey had a history of substance abuse and suffered from a learning disability. Despite the severity of his condition and his classification as a vulnerable adult, he did not receive a crucial mental health assessment, despite Ms. Rance's repeated requests for one. In a shocking revelation, the jury also heard that the young man's cell was not checked as frequently as necessary due to threats he posed to the staff. Despite the frequency of his observations every 30 minutes, the staff still did not enter his cell as he threatened to throw a television at anyone entering the room. Ms. Rance acknowledged the difficulties faced by the healthcare staff at the jail, stating that \u201cour team was tiny. We were absolutely fire-fighting,\u201d and \u201cdid we drop balls? Yes. Did we mean to drop balls?

Smith was found guilty of the double murder after a jury trial at Chelmsford Crown Court. During the trial, the court heard evidence that Smith had ended his relationship with the victim, Isobel Parker, after she had moved on and become pregnant by a new partner. Despite the break-up, Smith could not accept the end of the relationship and became obsessed with Ms Parker. In December 2014, Ms Parker informed Smith that she was pregnant and that the child was not his. After finding out about the pregnancy, Smith became increasingly obsessed with Ms Parker and began to threaten and harass her. He would send messages saying that he would kill her if she didn't return to him and he would \"put a bullet\" in the head of the unborn baby if Ms Parker didn't abort the child. In a police interview following the murder, Smith stated that he had gone to Ms Parker's home and killed her and her unborn child because he didn't want the unborn child to grow up without a father and he didn't want his reputation as a father to be tarnished. Ms Parker's body was found in the bath at her flat in Booth Place on 17th July 2015. The court was told that Ms Parker was buried with her unborn child in her arms. During the sentencing hearing, a statement was read out from Ms Parker's partner at the time of her murder by Smith. In his statement, Mr Shane Anderson said his \"whole world stopped\" when he found out about Ms Parker's death and he said he had gone to her grave every day. During the sentencing hearing, the judge said that the defendant \"could not accept\" the end of his relationship and \"struggled\" to deal with the reality of his ex-partner's pregnancy and his own fatherhood. The judge said the defendant's \"terrified\" and \"spirited\" victim \"put up a fight\" before being \"brutally and mercilessly\" killed. After the sentencing, the police said that the defendant had \"strangled\" Ms Parker \"to death\" and \"killed\" the unborn child and \"buried\" the victim \"with her unborn daughter\" in her \"","81":"The article provides an overview of the events that transpired during the storming of the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021.

It highlights the two notable cases of A-list actress Fan Bingbing and the President of global policing agency Interpol Meng Hongwei, who both disappeared in the summer of 2018 and were subjected to investigations for tax evasion and bribe-taking, respectively. The article notes that these cases sparked international attention but forced disappearances are not a new phenomenon in China, and the article provides an insight into the typical pattern of these disappearances, which usually involves the detention and interrogation of the individual before their eventual return and a forced confession and sentence.

As per the latest economic figures published by the UK's central bank - the bank of England- the British economy is currently experiencing a weaker six-month period of growth than the bank's last economic forecast in May.\n2. The bank's quarterly GDP figure for the second quarter of the year is now expected to be zero rather than the previously anticipated 0.2%.\n3. Despite this, the bank does not anticipate a sharp rebound in the third quarter of the year; instead, the economy is predicted to experience a meagre 0.3% of growth during that period.\n4. The bank's revision of the economy's current condition can be attributed to various factors, including volatile UK data and a no-deal Brexit.\n5. One of the main contributing factors to the revision of the economy's condition is the bank's accumulation of evidence suggesting that businesses, both small and large, believe that the ongoing trade negotiations with the EU will take longer and be more substantial than previously anticipated.\n6. As a result of these factors, the bank has calculated a one-in-three chance of an annual contraction in growth by early next year, a condition that would almost certainly constitute a recession.\n7. However, the bank's economic forecasts are affected by an inconsistency; while the bank's economic data assumes a smooth and relatively uncomplicated exit from the EU, the UK's financial markets, particularly sterling and UK government debt, anticipate a hard exit from the Union and a no-deal departure from the trading block.\n8. Overall, the bank's latest economic data suggests a weaker-than-expected performance of the UK's economy in the second quarter of the year, and a potentially challenging third quarter ahead.\n\nNow take a look at the original article and answer the following questions:\nWhat is the key takeaway from the article?

It was opened in 1995 and is operated by EDF Energy. Every 18 months, the plant shuts down for a refueling outage, during which time the reactor's fuel rods are replaced and the plant's systems and components are inspected and maintained. To carry out the refueling and maintenance work, an additional 1,000 workers are brought onto the site for the duration of the outage. These workers are hired from a variety of locations, including France and the United States, as well as from local contractors. Jim Crawford, the station director at Sizewell B, said that during the refueling outage, the reactor would shut down and all of the fuel rods would be removed. A certain amount of the old fuel would be replaced with new fuel to keep the plant running. Crawford said that the refueling outage would allow the plant's systems and components to be upgraded and maintained. He estimated that around 14,000 tasks would be completed during the refueling outage. Sizewell B typically employs around 500 staff and 250 contractors. However, during the refueling outage, the number of workers on the site would increase to around 1,000.

The letters were intended to be sent to 150 people likely to be affected by the scheme, but an error meant they were not sent out until just before the consultation began, a month later. Herefordshire Council has apologised and said it \u201cwas not acceptable for residents to find out through the press or social media\u201d. Contractor Balfour Beatty Living Places was due to send out the letters but did not, which its managing director Steve Helliwell said had been \u201chuman error\u201d. The firm apologised to those affected. Residents of Kings Acre Road said they only received letters last week and many only realised the situation when they saw the possible routes online. One resident, Justyn Waite, said: \u201cWe got a small apology in a letter from Balfour Beatty blaming a clerical error which isn't good enough and we've missed the first consultation because of this\u201d. The article mentions the potential impact of the options on the properties of the residents and the possible compulsory purchase of some houses if they are right under the route. The article also states that the proposals for the bypass have been debated for over 50 years and the construction of the scheme could start in 2020 if it gets approved.

Bangladeshi authorities blocked some websites for \"hurting religious feelings\" and many protesters took to the streets, demanding the execution of the bloggers and a ban on the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami. These tensions were compounded by renewed controversy over a tribunal judging war crimes committed during the 1971 independence war. A group of bloggers, led by Mr Haider, had launched mass protests demanding the execution of the Islamist party leader and a ban on the party, leading to clashes between supporters of the ruling Awami League and Islamist activists. In the wake of the violence, Islamist parties have called for a nationwide general strike and Bangladesh's parliament has amended a law allowing the state to appeal the life sentence given to the Islamist party leader. Overall, the article highlights the complex and contentious political and religious issues facing Bangladesh and the potential for violence and unrest as a result.","126":"The article discusses the decline of the number of people trying to quit smoking in Scotland.

The planning authority objected the appeal and said the proposed \"cart lodge\" would be an \"incongruous feature\" and would \"present a creeping domestication\" to the surrounding area. In conclusion, the article discusses the plans of the singer Ed Sheeran to build a \"cart lodge\" for housing vehicles at his home and the planning decision of the Suffolk Coastal District Council and the appeal of the decision by the singer.\n\nPost a summary of your post and a link below.

Security company Symantec also believes a hacking group linked to North Korea was behind the attack. But North Korea's involvement has been disputed by other security firms. Cashing out Wannacry victims included more than 60 NHS trusts in the UK as well as Fedex, Renault and Telefonica. Those hit by the worm were asked to pay a ransom to have their data restored. The newspaper said the NSA report claims that the worm was created by a hacker group \"sponsored\" by North Korea's spy agency - the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The assessment chimes with conclusions drawn by Symantec which said it was put together by the Lazarus hacker group working on behalf of the regime. The Washington Post said the evidence gathered in the report was \"not conclusive\" but strongly suggested North Korea's involvement. However, in late May, intelligence company Flashpoint said its analysis suggested hackers fluent in Chinese were responsible. In addition, James Scott, a senior fellow at the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, has thrown doubt on links between Lazarus and Pyongyang. Attempts to tie the two together were \"premature and inconclusive\", he wrote. As a money-making scheme the outbreak failed as, so far, none of the $140,000 (\u00a3110,000) in bitcoins raised in ransom payments by victims has been withdrawn. Security experts believed this is because the transactions will be easy to track, putting law enforcement on the trail of the worm's creators. If North Korea was involved in the Wannacry outbreak and other hacking attempts, then it could be the signal that the nation is gearing up for more attacks, John Hultquist, a computer security researcher at FireEye told Reuters. \"It suggests they are preparing for something fairly significant,\" he added.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com December 15, 2018, 10:33 pm ad1c9bdddf - https:\/\/brainmass.com\/computer-science\/wannacry-virus-vulnerability-and-remed","149":"The article \"A Year In Provence\" by Peter Mayle chronicles his move from England to France and his experiences living in the French countryside.

Duff & Phelps asked Mr Whyte to lie because they were afraid HMRC would remove them as administrators over a potential conflict of interest. The revelations are contained in a recorded conversation between the firm's David Grier and Craig Whyte. The Ticketus deal - which saw three years of Rangers season tickets sold to London finance firm Ticketus for \u00a325m - was uncovered eight months after the Motherwell-born businessman bought the club. Mr Whyte used the money to pay off Rangers' \u00a318m debt to Lloyds Banking Group. The revelation caused anger among Rangers fans, who accused Mr Whyte of lying about how he funded his purchase last May. In February 2012, when Rangers went into administration and Duff & Phelps took over, the firm described the Ticketus deal as \"a matter which we are looking at and trying to understand\". As well as being appointed administrators after the club plunged into insolvency, Duff & Phelps were also involved in Craig Whyte's takeover. And a BBC Scotland investigation broadcast in May suggested that Mr Grier, a senior Duff & Phelps partner, may have known about the controversial Ticketus deal before the Whyte takeover was complete. Mr Grier, and Duff & Phelps, denied the claims and said he was unaware of this particular Ticketus deal until August 2011. The recorded meeting between Mr Whyte and Mr Grier was held a week after the BBC documentary was aired. It revealed that Mr Grier not only knew that Mr Whyte had sold season tickets to fund the club's acquisition, but that they were intent on denying this because they thought they could get away with it. It also showed an attempt was made by Mr Grier to get Mr Whyte to agree to the publication of a press release which would vindicate the firm of any knowledge about the Ticketus deal used to buy the club. Mr Grier said: \"We knew that Ticketus was a funder but we did not know that Ticketus would be used for the purchase of the club.\" He said the firm was \"surprised\" when the deal came to light and \"did not know\" about the Ticketus deal when Mr Whyte acquired the club, adding: \"In hindsight we should have","156":"Joseph Muscat, whose country assumes the EU's presidency in January, told the BBC: \u201cThis is really and truly our position and I don't see it changing\u201d.

Steven Baxter and Jeffrey Ward are charged with murder and are on the run. Both defendants deny the charges at the Swansea Crown Court. The prosecutor Paul Lewis said the defendants were involved in an altercation the night before and both attacked Mr Clark. Steven Baxter inflicted the fatal wound upon him during the attack. Mr Clark's body was found the following day by a friend in the doorway of his caravan after he was stabbed in the chest with a knife. Mr Lewis said he was still clutching a metal pole, which could have been used in a fight between the defendants, and died where he fell. Mr Baxter and his partner Linda Rowley owned the caravan next door to Mr Clark and the other defendant Mr Ward lived nearby on the park. Mr Lewis said a post-mortem examination revealed Mr Clark suffered injuries to his left arm and hand, \"consistent with defence wounds\", before his death. Mr Baxter told police he grabbed the knife because it was the nearest object and Mr Clark \"fell on to the knife\".

L Brands valued the lingerie company at $1.1bn and will retain a 45% stake after the sale. Boss and executive chairman of Victoria's Secret, Leslie Wexner, will step down as part of the deal and will remain a member of the board. After selling several businesses, L Brands said it will concentrate on the beauty chain it owns, Bath & Body Works. In 2019, Mr Wexner came under fire for his long friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Wexner employed Epstein as a close adviser, but cut ties in 2007. He said he was \"embarrassed\" by his friendship with the US financier and also previously accused Epstein of misappropriating money. L Brands said it was important to \"evolve\" its marketing strategy at the time as the annual fashion show saw its lowest ratings ever and drew criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity.\n\n[This article's comments section will be left blank for the time being]","173":"Gay marriage will not harm the British family.

The sale took place in July and was a controversial decision as it was sold off without public consultation and against the wishes of the local community. The proceeds from the sale were used to fund an extension of the town's museum. Arts Council England ruled the sale breached the accredited standards for how museums manage their collections. As a result of the ruling, the Northampton Museum and Art Gallery and the council-run Abington Park Museum were removed from the Accreditation Scheme and were excluded from future participation until at least August 2019. The Accreditation Scheme sets nationally agreed standards for museums in the UK and has strict criteria for the disposal of cultural objects. The sale of the Sekhemka statue was controversial and the Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as an \"abuse to the Egyptian archaeology\". Despite the controversy and the loss of funding from the Accreditation Scheme, the leader of Northampton Borough Council, David Mackintosh, said the decision to sell the statue was a \"difficult\" one and said the proceeds would benefit the local community and help fund an extension of the town's museum.

Many people will have faced when they come across someone begging in the street. The city council believed it had the answer. But its series of hard-hitting posters telling the public not to hand over their cash to beggars have since been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.The ASA said the posters, which claimed money given to beggars would be used on drugs, alcohol and fraud, reinforced \"negative stereotypes\" and were likely to cause offence. New figures released on Wednesday showed homelessness in England has risen to its highest level for nearly 10 years. A total of 15,170 households were classed as homeless in the three months to June 2016 - a jump of 10% on the same period last year, according to figures from Department for Communities and Local Government. With more people suffering from homelessness, the general public may feel they wish to give cash to those sleeping rough. But London-based homeless charity Thames Reach said handing over money to beggars \"can have fatal consequences\". Its outreach teams estimate 80% of people begging in the capital do so to support a drug habit which is often an addiction to substances including crack cocaine and heroin. Communications manager Mike Nicholas said: \"Most people begging are not individuals in temporary difficulties, but people who are dependent on a begging income. \"This is almost certainly to fund a serious drug habit. There is no need to beg on the streets in 2016. \"As an organization that has worked with people on the street since 1984, we have seen many lives damaged by hard drugs and alcohol misuse. \"We have even lost people through overdoses in situations where a significant portion of the money they spent on drugs came from members of the public giving loose change \"Giving to people who beg is not a benign act. \"The effect of people's generosity can be the difference between them living a homeless life and a life off the streets and into accommodation and recovery services. \"If we can all stop giving to people who beg, we will reduce the number of people living rough and stop people harming themselves and others as a result of the money we give them.\"The charity said money given to them would instead help people become housed and give them access to drug and alcohol services.\n\nAnswer the following questions after reading the article above.","183":"The key points of the article can be summarized as follows:1.

George VI, the reigning king at the time, was responsible for the decorations and only \"very few changes\" were made during his reign from 1936 to 1952. The 19 state rooms remain intact 66 years after the last significant work and the pictures of the White Drawing Room from 1947, 1993 and 2011 show it looking the same. Most people decorate their houses every 10 years or so for fashion reasons, but the Royal Family does not decorate Buckingham Palace for the same reason; they prefer it to keep looking the same. Ellen Leslie, a historian and author of \"The Royal Family\" (2011), last visited Buckingham Palace in 2012 and said the decor looked fine at the time. The state rooms are finished in a neoclassical and empire style and the Blue Drawing Room features blue flock wallpaper and columns painted to resemble the stone onyx. The Throne Room, designed by John Nash, features a plaster frieze showing scenes from the Wars of the Roses. Only routine touching-up has occurred during the reign of Elizabeth II, which began in 1952. The Royal Family does not decorate Buckingham Palace for fashion reasons; they prefer it to look the same and the reason it's lasted so well is that it was furnished and decorated to a very high standard in the first place. Any renovation work that goes will not mean change, more a continuation of what is already there and it doesn't surprise me how it's lasted. A US study suggests the average \"life expectancy\" of wallpaper is just seven years. That on display in the Blue Drawing Room was not damaged during World War Two. George VI's reign ended when he died in 1952 and his eldest daughter Elizabeth succeeded him as Queen of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms. Her reign began the day after his death and continues as of January 2017 as the longest of any British monarch and the third-longest of any monarch of a country which currently exists.","193":"A research report by the Bevan Foundation think tank has revealed that people without internet access miss out on cheaper goods and services and run the risk of being excluded from vital public services. Nobody should be excluded because they are unable to use the internet, says the report's author, Victoria Winckler. The Welsh government agrees and is helping break down the barriers. The report looked at public services that are already available online and found many were not user-friendly. While only a few services are delivered primarily online, such as self-assessment taxation and driving licensing and vehicle road tax, there is a move towards introducing more services in the next few years. The UK government says public services should be 'digital by default' and the Welsh government is exploring how to put public services online as well. The report found that the people who rely most on public services are the least likely to use the internet. There are over 100 computers available free of charge in public libraries in Caerphilly county borough, but there are limitations on how useful they are. The report calls for a better public access to the internet and support and training in using computers.","194":"In the article, a man named Dale Walker from the UK describes his experience with the UK government's new online tax payment system. He explains that the abolished paper tax discs would have prevented his car from being impounded, as physical evidence would have prevented the incident from happening. Mr. Walker believes the new system is wrong and offered police online evidence proving he had paid his tax, but was told the issue was a \"DVLA matter\" and not a police issue. The article states that the DVLA accepted the mistake but said these incidents are \"rare\". Mr. Walker felt humiliated to have the police impound his car and he had to take two days off of work to sort the damage caused to his car's handbrake. Mr. Walker believes the government should physically send evidence of tax payment and not rely solely on an online database. He states the price of a stamp and administration costs would save time and money and ensure physical evidence of tax payment. Despite his experience, the DVLA states these incidents are \"rare\" and apologizes for the inconvenience caused. They process over 44 million tax payments each year and incidents like Mr. Walker's are \"very rare\". Mr. Walker's experience highlights the need for physical evidence of tax payment and the potential consequences of a flawed online tax payment system.","195":"1) Poland's chief rabbi Michael Schudrich and US state department's special advisor Stuart Eizenstat were disappointed at the Polish government's decision to suspend work on a law designed to address the historical property claims of Jews and other Polish citizens.\n2) Poland's prime minister Donald Tusk said the decision would be reconsidered when Poland's financial situation improved.\n3) Nazi Germany exterminated about 90% of Poland's pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million during World War II and the victims were stripped of their property, meaning there are many claims from relatives.\n4) Most of the property claims relate to Poles who lost property confiscated after the war by the communist regime.\n5) Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski said the US had given up its right to represent its citizens in such cases under a compensation agreement from the 1960s and that the US should have helped Polish Jews in 1943-44.","196":"The UK government wants to keep control of 24 EU policy areas temporarily to preserve trade within the UK. Carwyn Jones and Nicola Sturgeon have now written to the House of Lords calling for changes to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. They claim powers held back include areas of \"vital importance\" to them. The EU (Withdrawal) Bill - currently being examined in detail at committee stage in the Lords - aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them. As the bill currently stands, powers in devolved areas that are currently wielded at EU level - such as support for farmers - are set to return to Westminster rather than Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. Last week UK ministers announced the list of powers that they would retain at a UK level, for a temporary period, including food labelling and chemicals regulation. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said at the time that the \"vast majority\" of Brussels powers in 158 devolved policy areas would be in the control of Wales and Scotland \"on the day we leave the EU\". But he added: \"There is a much smaller group of powers where the devolved governments will be required to follow current EU laws for a little bit longer while we work out a new UK approach.\" In the letter to peers, Mr Jones and Ms Sturgeon said these covered areas of \"vital importance\" for the industries and economies of Wales and Scotland. They said they agreed \"common frameworks\" for UK-wide policies were \"appropriate in some cases\" but rejected the idea of letting UK ministers set them up without approval from Cardiff Bay and Holyrood. \"The devolved legislatures would be asked to agree to the creation of this power with no certainty about where frameworks will be established, how these will work, how they will be governed and how we will go from temporary restrictions to longer term solutions,\" the first ministers said.

Employment also continued to rise, with a stronger performance reported among service industries than the manufacturing sector. However, food, fuel and labour costs all rose during the month. September's rise in new business - the 10th in successive months - was supported by further growth in new export orders for manufacturers. A strong housing market was another factor driving the upturn, according to survey respondents. The PMI monitor for September recorded sharp increases in business activity in the services sector, with the most marked pace of growth being seen in travel, tourism and leisure. Jobs growth The increase in activity built on solid jobs growth observed at services firms during August. September's survey also pointed to a \"sharp and accelerated increase\" in new business at Scottish service providers. There was a further slowdown in the rate of growth of manufacturing output north of the border, but it remained \"at a level consistent with a solid pace of expansion overall\". Scottish manufacturers hired more staff during the month, continuing a trend observed in each month since February. New order intakes rose for the ninth successive month in September, but the rate of growth eased sharply from the marked pace observed in July and August. Export sales Goods producers north of the border also registered improved export sales in September. Meanwhile, higher food, fuel and labour costs helped to lift input price inflation to well above the UK average. However, the survey found businesses largely refrained from passing on increased costs to clients. Bank of Scotland chief economist Donald MacRae said: \"The PMIs of the last six months suggest the Scottish economy not only grew in quarter two this year but saw that growth accelerate in quarter three. \"The recovery is gaining momentum.\" Enterprise Minister Fergus Ewing welcomed the survey's findings and said the Scottish government would look at what the survey can add to existing economic analysis.\n\nMake sure you weave the key details in your summary.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com March 4, 2021, 11:38 pm ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/economics\/economic-growth\/bank-of-scotlands-pmi-monitor-373083\n\nThe solution describes the key points in the article","201":"The Scottish Affairs Committee said it was \"appalled\" to discover thousands of workers were put on the list. It added that in many cases people were included for raising legitimate concerns over health and safety issues. The list was drawn up by The Consulting Association (TCA). The organization was closed down in 2009 after being raided by the Information Commissioner's Office. Unions are seeking compensation, arguing that those on the blacklist were denied work. The MPs said some of the biggest names in construction as well as many smaller firms had been involved. In an interim report, the committee said: \"The organization set up to create, maintain and operate the blacklist - The Consulting Association (TCA) - appears to have been largely established by Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, which also provided TCA's chairmen for eight of its 16 years of operation. \"Other major subscribers included Skanska and Balfour Beatty.\" Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, whose director Cullum McAlpine appeared before the committee, responded to the report by denying it had ever operated a blacklist. 'Morally indefensible' The MPs said that while the blacklist was not initially illegal, it was always \"morally indefensible\", and the companies involved continued to use it after it had become illegal. The MPs found companies set up a structure through TCA which allowed them to submit names and information on workers they deemed to be unsuitable to a central list and to check prospective employees against that list. \"The emphasis throughout was on secrecy, with telephone access to sensitive information restricted to only a few, with the lists of names submitted destroyed at the end of each working day and no acknowledgement that such a system existed,\" the MPs said. The committee, which gained access to the card file database that was maintained by TCA, said notes about individuals who were on the blacklist included: \"Subject is a shop steward and member of the TGWU. Is a troublemaker. If she is not a good worker I would not hire her.\" \"Subject is a shop steward and a troublemaker.

Named the Freedom 251, the handset is a 3G smartphone with specifications similar to phones at least 15 times more expensive. Ringing Bells is a company less than a year old and based in Noida near the capital Delhi. They offered pre-orders for the Freedom 251 on their website freedom251.com for a day and the site crashed under the weight of traffic from potential buyers. Ringing Bells's founder Mohit Goel said the phone would be locally made as part of the \"Make in India\" program promoted aggressively by the government of India's prime minister Narendra Modi. The prototypes of the Freedom 251 were of a Chinese-made phone with its brand name Adcom covered with white paint. Adcom is a Delhi-based importer of technology products and the Ikon 4 handset, sold for $59 on Flipkart, looked very similar to the Freedom 251. Mohit Goel, the company's founder said the Freedom 251 would be a locally manufactured device and would only be available in India. The Hindustan Times Newspaper quoted Adcom's marketing head saying Adcom wasn't associated with the Freedom 251 handset. The experience of the Freedom 251 was as expected for an entry-level phone in the $50 range.

The trade is not only lucrative for the poachers and the smugglers but is also fuelled by people at the end of the supply chain who see the rhino horn as a commodity for sale and purchase. In a desperate attempt to save the animal from total extinction the South African government has commissioned a report on the possible legalisation of the trade of the Rhino's horns. According to the report the government would take control of the trade and make it legal thereby minimising the risks of criminal syndicates involved in the trade and would raise money to support the preservation of the Rhino population. As the trade is illegal at present the government has no control over the trade and the smuggling routes and neither does the government benefit from the proceeds of the trade at all. With the legalisation of the trade the government would have control over the routes and the sale of the commodity as well as the money from the proceeds from the trade and would thus be able to fund the preservation of the Rhino population at present and into the future. Although the trade would be limited and would have a negative impact on the existing preservation and conservation efforts at present the report suggests that the legalisation of the trade would help the preservation of the Rhino species as a whole as the government would have control over the trade and the proceeds of the trade and the money would help preserve the species as a whole and not just for the individual animal. As the trade would help preserve the species as a whole the animal would not only survive but would thrive and thus the trade would not only help save the animal from total extinction but would help preserve the species as a whole.\n\nKeywords: Rhino, trade, illegal, criminal syndicates, smuggling routes, money from the proceeds from the trade","208":"The article discusses the character of Rebecca White, the feisty sister of Chrissie Sugden and the daughter of Lawrence White, in the British television soap opera Emmerdale.

After a jury returned a guilty verdict, he became the first UK banker to be jailed since the financial crash.

Businesses are exempt from the ban, but delivery services have been affected, as many of them rely on motorbikes for delivery purposes. Similar bans have been implemented in cities across Africa as a way of reducing crime and congestion. In some cities, the bans have been controversial, as many commuters depend on motorbikes for transport and the bans have limited their ability to travel. Despite the controversy, the bans have been effective in reducing the number of crimes related to motorbikes and scooters and the cities affected have seen a decrease in criminal activity. In the city of Addis Ababa, the ban has been implemented for one month and the city's residents will need to wait and see if the ban is effective in reducing criminal activity and congestion in the city centre.","212":"The article discusses the demolition and rebuilding of the Regent Cinema in Redcar, a historic landmark in the town. The cinema, which was built in the 1920s and closed in 2018 due to its deteriorating condition, will be replaced with a modern cinema at a cost of \u00a39.6m. Despite some objections from local residents, the demolition and rebuilding of the cinema is seen as a necessary step to bring the town's economy back to life. In response to the objections, councillors said the existing cinema is not listed or historically significant and only demolition and a rebuild is a viable option. A public consultation conducted earlier revealed that over 700 people were in support of the rebuilding of the cinema and a modern cinema would be a welcome addition to the town's economy. To complete the construction of the new cinema, temporary sea wall defenses will need to be installed to protect the area from flooding and erosion. Overall, the article highlights the need for modernization and economic growth in Redcar and the importance of balancing historic preservation with the need for progress and improvement.","213":"1.

Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said this was \"beyond belief\" and an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\". Ms Sturgeon said she did not accept Mr Salmond's account and said opposition MSPs had taken his claims \"as gospel\". The first minister said the claims of a conspiracy against her predecessor were \"deeply unfair to the women involved\" and to \"the efforts to create a culture in Scotland where women feel they can come forward with complaints\". Mr Salmond is expected to give evidence to a Holyrood inquiry into the government's handling of complaints against him on Friday, with Ms Sturgeon to follow next Wednesday. Mr Salmond has made accusations of a \"malicious and concerted\" attempt to remove him from public life, taking aim at Ms Sturgeon, her government and the party he once led, the SNP. The first minister has rejected the claims, saying there is \"not a shred of evidence\" that there was a conspiracy. At her weekly question session at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon was challenged by opposition leaders about Mr Salmond's claims and whether her government had engaged in a \"cover-up\". Ms Baillie - a member of the Holyrood inquiry committee - said the probe was at its heart about two women who had been failed by the government, after it admitted its investigation of their complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful. 'Breakdown of trust' And she said that \"astonishingly\", the name of one of the women involved had been passed to Mr Salmond while a meeting with Ms Sturgeon was being arranged. She said the identity of the woman had been revealed to Geoff Aberdein - Mr Salmond's former chief of staff - and was then conveyed on to him. Ms Baillie said this was an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\" and a \"fundamental breakdown of trust\". Ms Sturgeon replied: \"Jackie Baillie is accepting at face value Alex Salmond's account of all of this. I do not accept his account of all of this.\"","215":"In the article titled \"Demolition at the Catthorpe interchange\", the Highways Agency announced the demolition of the M6 viaduct at the Catthorpe Interchange over the M1.

These barracks were the home of the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment. They were redeveloping these barracks into housing and were doing some archaeological research while they were at it. They were doing this research on behalf of Taylor Wimpey. In the research they came up with some remains of what we're going to call spearmen. These spearmen were from the 5th or 6th Century A.D and were Germanic or Saxon origin and were a post Roman \"spearmen\" group. \"They lived at a time when many men from the continent were hired by the Romans and posted at frontier towns and cities like Colchester to act as soldiers,\" said Mr Crummy. \"Some then turned on their masters and paved the way for the conquest of much of eastern Britain by their own kind,\" he said. \"There is a strong probability these were post Roman 'spearmen', with Germanic or Saxon origin,\" said Trust director Philip Crummy. \"But there is a tantalizing possibility they were 4th or early 5th Century, in which case they could have been part of a militia living here in Roman times.\" They were looking into DNA tests to try and find out when the spearmen actually lived.","218":"The key points of the article can be summarized as follows: \u2022 Network Rail wants to increase the height of the wall in Dawlish to protect the main railway line destroyed by storms in February. \u2022 A walkway on top of the wall is used by thousands of people every year. \u2022 Network Rail said it was confident it could find a solution \"which works for almost everyone\". \u2022 In the 1840s, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who created the rail line, lost the same battle with a landowner over the wall. \u2022 Ann Large, who lives in Sea Lawn Terrace which sits on the site of the old house, said \"The world and his wife will be standing and gawping at the properties if the wall is raised\". \u2022 Another resident said \"It's going to have an impact on our privacy and security and I'm sure there are other ways of improving the integrity of the seawall\". \u2022 Peter Large supports the Network Rail option and said \"I would be much happier if the footpath is raised so it does give us that extra strength and resilience\". \u2022 Network Rail wants to bolster the defences of the seawall and raise the seawall walkway is the best way to do that. \u2022 Network Rail said \"We are aware that this means some changes for residents of local houses, which is why we have explained our plans and asked for feedback\"..","219":"1. British conductor and musician Clive Wearing contracted a brain infection in 1985.\n2. He was left with a memory span of only 10 seconds.\n3. The infection - herpes encephalitis - left him unable to recognize people he had seen or remember things that had been said just moments earlier.\n4. Despite being acknowledged by doctors as having one of the most severe cases of amnesia ever, his musical ability and much of his musical memory was intact.\n5. Now aged 73, he is still able to read music and play the piano and once even conducted his former choir again.\n6. Now researchers believe they are closer to understanding how musical memory is preserved in some people - even when they can remember almost nothing of their past.\n7. At a Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington this month, a group of German neurologists described the case of a professional cellist, referred to as PM, who contracted herpes encephalitis virus in 2005.\n8. He was unable to retain even simple information, such as the layout of his apartment.\n9. But Dr Carsten Finke of Charite University Hospital in Berlin says he was \"astonished\" that the cellist's musical memory was largely intact and that he was still able to play his instrument.\n10. The brain's medial temporal lobes, which are largely destroyed by severe cases of herpes encephalitis are \"highly relevant\" for remembering things such as facts and how, where and when an event happened.\n11. \"But this case and also the Clive Wearing case suggest that musical memory seems to be stored independently of the medial temporal lobes,\" Dr Finke says.\n12. Musical therapy He has also studied the case of a Canadian patient who in the 1990s lost all musical memory after having surgery that damaged another part of the brain known as the superior temporal gyrus.\n13. This has led him to conclude that the structures of the brain used for musical memory \"might be the superior temporal gyrus or the frontal lobes\".\n14. Dr Finke says more research is needed to confirm his findings and to determine if the same applies to people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's.","220":"The article discusses the purchase of Cyfronydd Hall, a property located in Montgomeryshire, by the British Foreign Secretary William Hague and his wife Ffion.

A group of objectors, including doctors, lawyers, and scientists, have called for the Real Bodies: The Exhibition in Sydney to be shut down. They claim the bodies of the executed Chinese inmates, including political prisoners, may be included in the exhibition.\n2. The organizers of the exhibition strongly deny these allegations, calling them \"lies\" and \"sensationalism.\" They say the 20 cadavers were legally provided by a medical university in China, where hospitals had declared them as \"unclaimed corpses.\"\n3. The bodies have been preserved through a method known as plastination, where the fluids are drained and replaced with silicone, allowing the skinned bodies to be exhibited in life-like poses.\n4. In an open letter to Australian politicians, the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China states there is \"credible evidence\" that the bodies may belong to \"executed prisoners and prisoners of conscience from China.\"\n5. Prof Maria Fiatarone Singh from the University of Sydney's medical school and Prof Vaughan Macefield from the University of Western Sydney were concerned about the origin of the bodies, as Dalian is the \"epicentre\" for executions of prisoners associated with Falun Gong, a spiritual movement banned in China. They were also concerned about the lack of identification of the bodies and the predominantly young male appearance, as medical schools usually have bodies donated from older people.\n6. The organizers of the exhibition stated that the cadavers were procured from a reputable source and were not obtained from a political prisoner or execution victim and were not a subject of an unethical practice. They said the cadavers were provided by a research institute at a university and were not obtained from a political prisoner or an execution victim and were not a subject of an unethical practice.\n7.

His wife Lindsey applied for the court to withdraw his life support as he would see living in a minimally conscious state as \"hell\" and he would not see a life like that as worth living for. Doctors from Walton Centre in Liverpool opposed the application and said that the police officer would not have a quality of life which he would feel as a good one and living like that would be hell for him. Paul Briggs suffered a bleed in his brain and fractures in his spine during the accident and he is kept alive with the help of the doctors. In the best case scenario the doctors said he would not have a normal life as he would remain physically disabled and his mental capacity would not be good and he would not understand his condition. Doctors from the Walton Centre and the Wirral Clinical Commissioning Group said that Paul Briggs would not feel tormented and trapped psychologically if his life support was withdrawn and he would live a life where he would not be able to enjoy the pleasures of life like before. The doctors were of the view that if his life support was withdrawn he would not experience pain and distress. After the accident a woman named Chelsea Rowe was given a 12-month jail term for dangerous driving after causing an injury to Paul Briggs. The judge would make his judgment at a later date after hearing all the arguments from both the parties involved in the case.\n\n- What I like about this topic?\n- What I don't like about this topic?\n- What questions does this topic raise for you?

It hopes the local data will help doctors and politicians tackle the specific problems in their patch. There is separate data for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the greater Glasgow area had the highest cancer mortality while Shetland had the lowest. Mortality was much higher in Belfast than the rest of Northern Ireland. Merthyr Tydfil was one of the worst performing parts of Wales, while Ceredigion had better cancer survival rates. Harrow, Richmond and Surrey in the south of England performed better than areas further north such as Stoke, Hartlepool and Nottingham. Smoking A significant factor in the regional variation is differences in lifestyle, such as smoking, which is linked to lung cancer. Kensington and Chelsea, East Sussex and Devon all had fewer than 35 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 people. The rate is more than double - in excess of 85 per 100,000, in cities such as Hull, Manchester and Liverpool. A similar website presented by Public Health England led Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to describe the differences in England as \"shocking\". Charlotte Williams, the executive director of London Cancer, said: \"[The tool] means it's easier to identify where we're doing well, and where we could do better, and how we could potentially learn from others. \"This will pinpoint where we need to improve to help ensure everyone gets the best care possible.\" Sara Hiom, director of patient engagement and early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said: \"In the UK we are privileged to have access to valuable information about cancer diagnosis and treatments for different parts of the country. \"We've created this website because we hope that it will allow policymakers and healthcare professionals to understand what's going on in their area and take action where necessary. \"The website allows people to see the different data for the different parts of the country and to compare them to each other.

The decision follows an independent review led by Baroness Julia Cumberlege, which was tasked with looking at harm reported by women who received the treatment. The review found that there was no evidence on the benefits of mesh for treating urinary incontinence that would outweigh \"the severity of human suffering caused by mesh complications\". As a result, the review team recommended a halt to procedures until certain checks and measures are met by March 2019. These measures include keeping a register of every procedure and any complications, and a requirement for healthcare providers to ensure that women have had access to all the information they need to make an informed choice about whether to proceed with the treatment. The government has said that the pause can be lifted if these measures are met, but that it remains committed to ensuring that women have access to the best possible care and support.

Mr. Drakeford said Mr. Gething's efforts during the pandemic had been \"extraordinary\" but he felt it was time \"to ask someone else to take on that challenge\".

The mayors believe that the ban will improve air quality and reduce pollution. They will give incentives for alternative vehicle use and promote walking and cycling. The use of diesel in transport has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, as concerns about its impact on air quality have grown. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that around three million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Diesel engines contribute to the problem in two key ways - through the production of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Very fine soot PM can penetrate the lungs and can contribute to cardiovascular illness and death. Nitrogen oxides can help form ground level ozone and this can exacerbate breathing difficulties, even for people without a history of respiratory problems. As the evidence has mounted, environmental groups have used the courts to try and enforce clear air standards and regulations. In the UK, campaigners have recently had success in forcing the government to act more quickly. Now, mayors from a number of major cities with well known air quality problems have decided to use their authority to clamp down on the use of diesel. In the UK, campaigners are calling for London's mayor to commit to phase out diesel vehicles from London by 2025. Sadiq Khan has proposed an expansion to the planned Ultra-Low Emission Zone in central London. ClientEarth lawyer Alan Andrews said: \"In the UK, London's mayor is considering bolder action than his predecessor, proposing an expansion to the planned Ultra-Low Emission Zone.

Not many - but Bo Rap is one of them. A sprawling, six-minute rock opera, it has been Christmas number one twice, soundtracked a pivotal scene in Wayne's World, and sold 2.44 million copies in the UK alone. Not bad for a song the record company said would never be played on the radio. Written by frontman Freddie Mercury, Bohemian Rhapsody was painstakingly pieced together in six studios, pushing 1970s recording technology to its limits. The song's multi-tracked 'bismillahs' and 'scaramouches' were overdubbed so often that the tapes became virtually transparent. But the band never lost faith in the track. \"We all realised it was something wonderful and we should give it our heart and soul,\" says Brian May. To mark the 40th anniversary, the guitarist looked back at the writing process, the boundary-breaking music video, and the song's resurrection in Wayne's World. THE BEGINNING There was no demo.

The movie has proved to be a surprise hit, vindicating the star, Vin Diesel, who wrested control of the character from movie studio Universal. The Butler, starring Forest Whitaker as a White House staff member who serves eight presidents, took second place. Another movie, This Is Us, which is a documentary about the pop group One Direction, dropped to number six in its second week of release. The pop group's 3D film saw its takings tumble from $15.8m to $4.1m, but it has already recouped its modest $10m budget several times over. It was originally thought to have topped the US box office last weekend, but final figures overturned early estimates, placing The Butler back at number one. This meant that the civil rights drama was the first film of 2013 to spend three weeks at the top of the chart. The only new release last week was Riddick, which gave a boost to a traditionally sluggish September box office. \"Typically, the weekend after Labor Day is one of the slowest weekends of the year,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for Hollywood.com. \"By Universal releasing a brand-new sci-fi movie with one of the biggest stars in the world, they took advantage of that and came out on top. It gave the weekend a nice boost.\" Other films in the top five included Spanish-language comedy Instructions Not Included, starring and directed by Mexican television star Eugenio Derbez, at number three. Jennifer Aniston comedy We're The Millers came fourth, with Disney animation Planes fifth. Cameo deal Vin Diesel first played Riddick, an alien mercenary with glowing eyes, in 2000's low-budget thriller Pitch Black. It proved to be his breakout role, after bit parts in films such as Saving Private Ryan. It generated a live-action sequel, The Chronicles Of Riddick, in 2004. Plans for further instalments evaporated when the film only took $116m, against a budget of $100m. But the character got a","267":"She was killed by a car bomb near her home in October.

The family's London-based lawyers have set out their demands in a legal document, submitted to the Maltese government on Thursday.

Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Tehran for the funeral of 62-year-old Soleimani, who headed the elite Quds Force and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East. Many mourners held up photos of Soleimani, with some even wearing clothes bearing his image. The coffins of Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who also died in the US strike in Baghdad, were passed over the heads of mourners. Supreme Leader Khamenei was joined by top political and military figures in Iran in paying respects to the commander.

The government and the protesters are due to meet again on Thursday, but so far, little progress has been made in talks between them. The committee representing the protesters has handed President Duque a list of 13 demands, which include that the government fully meet its obligations under the terms of the peace process signed with the left-wing rebels of the Farc in 2016, and that it do more to prevent the killings of social activists and former rebels. Some of the protesters accuse President Duque, who opposed the peace agreement, of trying to undermine it. The committee also wants assurances that the pension age will not be raised and that the minimum wage will not be cut for young people. President Duque denies having plans to change either and says the protesters are being manipulated by his political rivals. Following the death of one young protester after he was hit by a projectile fired by riot police, the committee is also calling for that force to be dismantled. Eighteen-year-old Dilan Cruz died after he was hit on the head by a beanbag round, a fabric sack filled with lead shot. President Duque has ruled out disbanding the riot police force. He has also called for a \"great national dialogue\" to discuss the protesters' demands, but the committee behind the protests has demanded that the talks be solely between it and the government as it fears having other groups represented would \"water them down\".

Speaking to the French-language weekly news magazine Jeune Afrique, Mr Kagame denounced the \"direct role of Belgium and France in the political preparation for the genocide\". The article also mentions that Mr. Kagame was quoted as saying that the only plausible reproach in France's eyes is in not having done enough to save lives during the genocide.\n\nThe article further discusses that Rwanda is preparing to mark the 20th anniversary of the atrocities that claimed at least 800,000 lives - mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus - over a period of about 100 days. The violence was triggered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu who was killed when his plane was shot down on 6 April 1994. The genocide came to an end after Mr Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) - a Tutsi-led rebel group - defeated government troops in July that year. His party still controls the government and has long accused France - an ally of Mr Habyarimana's government at the time - of aiding the genocide. In recent years there has been a thaw in relations between the two countries, with a visit by Mr Kagame to Paris in 2011 and the establishment by France of a genocide investigation unit. Last month, a Paris court sentenced former Rwandan spy chief Pascal Simbikangwa to 25 years in jail for his role in the genocide - the first such conviction in France. France has acknowledged that serious","284":"The Ucas admissions figures have been released, showing a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union. Universities have been warning about the impact of Brexit on their finances if European applications fall and these figures show a significant decline in candidates from the EU. These Ucas admissions figures, up to the January deadline for courses starting in the autumn, show a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union - with a total of about 564,000. The fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees. Applications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%. Nursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans. \"We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,\" said Ms Davies. She said the \"nursing workforce is in crisis\". But there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school. Among 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%. But among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group. And there could be an upside for those who are seeking places - with universities likely to be competing for the remaining places.","285":"Jennings, 33, killed Ruby Wilson, 94, at her Buckhurst Hill care home on 29 November 2017.

Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) is a pension fund with 303,000 members and assets of \u00a337.9bn. It has a deficit of \u00a37.9bn according to its own analysis. However, using the formula that private companies use, this deficit is put at \u00a310.5bn. The concern is that such a significant hole in the pension fund could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students.\n\nA pension consultant, John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, has analyzed for Newsnight that to make good the deficit of \u00a310.5bn over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to \u00a31.8bn. This equates to a rise in tuition fees of up to \u00a31,000 a year. Mr Ralfe said that there is a whole degree of denial. USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. \"We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. \"There will be repercussions for the university sector.

On the one hand the vote had been won in 1918 (for those aged over 30) and the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919 had removed most barriers to the professions. On the other hand, there was entrenched discrimination such as unequal pay and enforced retirement on marriage - the Marriage Bar - in occupations such as teaching and the civil service. The adage \"a woman's place is in the home\" was true for most women, once they were married. So who were the women who came to work at the early BBC? When it was founded at the close of 1922, broadcasting in Britain was virtually unknown. Those who arrived at Savoy Hill, the BBC's home until 1932, were part of a brand new industry, toiling together to get the first broadcast schedules on air. Few were actual producers, most worked behind the scenes, with women providing the vital secretarial and clerical support. As one official wryly observed \"the telephones never stopped ringing, the typewriters never stopped clicking, the duplicating machines duplicated for dear life\". It was the birth of broadcasting. Because the BBC was brand new there were no set employment practices, unlike teaching and the civil service, two of the most common occupations for middle-class women in the 1920s. In 1926, John Reith, the BBC's managing director, issued a statement declaring that women should be \"on the same footing as men\", with the same chances for promotion. Women were on the same salary scales as men, and there was no Marriage Bar, at least not until 1932. Even then, the BBC made allowances for exceptional women to remain on the staff list. In 1939, the three highest earning women - Mary Somerville (director of school broadcasting), Mary Adams (television producer) and Barbara Burnham (drama producer) - were all married. Mary Somerville and Mary Adams were also both mothers. In fact it was the announcement of Mary Somerville's pregnancy that prompted the BBC to introduce","291":"1.

It has already put 15% to 25% tariffs on $7.5bn worth of other EU goods as part of the dispute. The EU warned it would damage firms on both side of the Atlantic. And UK Trade Minister Liz Truss said she was disappointed by the move, warning against the use of \"tit-for-tat\" tariffs. The row centres on EU subsidies given to Airbus before 2004, which Washington says created an unfair advantage over the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing. Last year, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled the subsidies were illegal and allowed the US to levy tariffs on EU goods, including aircraft, wines and cheese. But it is now considering a parallel case involving illegal support for Boeing, which could see the EU imposing duties later this year. The US said pastry and cakes, gin, cashmere clothes and hardware products could all be in the firing line for new tariffs, affecting exporters across the continent. In a statement the EU said Washington was going beyond what was allowed by the WTO. \"It creates uncertainty for companies and inflicts unnecessary economic damage on both sides of the Atlantic,\" it added. \"This is particularly the case as companies are now trying to overcome the economic difficulties in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.\" Since 2017, the US has been embroiled in a damaging trade war with China, which it accuses of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. However, it has also trained it fire on allies including the EU. Before last year's tariffs over Airbus, the Trump administration had imposed duties on EU steel and aluminium - spurring Brussels to tax iconic US products such as denim jeans and motorcycles. Mr Trump has also threatened duties on European cars, a particular concern to Germany. US-levied tariffs are paid by US businesses, which in turn may pass those costs on to consumers.

The company was found to have used sub-standard silicone gel \u2013 rather than medical-grade silicone \u2013 which resulted in many implants rupturing. The company\u2019s founder, Jean-Claude Mas, was convicted of fraud and fined 75,000 euros. Four other former PIP executives were also convicted and given lesser sentences. The trial was considered one of the biggest in French legal history, with more than 5,000 women registered as plaintiffs and about 300 lawyers involved. The issue of whether the sub-standard silicone used in the implants posed any danger was not resolved by the trial. Mas showed no sign of emotion as sentence was passed, and his lawyer blamed the severity of the sentence on pressure generated by the media. He and the others had all admitted to fraud. PIP\u2019s director-general was sentenced to three years in prison, two of which were suspended. The company\u2019s head of quality control received two years, one of them suspended, and the head of research and development was sentenced to 18 months, suspended. Throughout the trial, Mas had denied the silicone used was harmful while all but one of the other defendants said they had not been aware of the risks.

It is a way for employers to screen potential new recruits and to make sure that new workers have a basic grasp of workplace dynamics before they clock on for the first time. However, some people argue that work experience is nothing more than a vast army of unpaid labour and that the expectation in many industries that they will be prepared to work for free means that it is mostly those from privileged backgrounds who benefit. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 21.7% of summer 2009 graduates who were in employment six months later had been taken on by an employer with whom they had previously had some kind of work experience. This summer will see many young people taking time out from their studies by making their first excursions into office life.

The party is also urging a \"clean exit\" from the EU. Leader Gerard Batten said the policies unveiled aimed to help \"the people who form the backbone of Britain\". He is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Nigel Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU Referendum. The party has also suffered a funding crisis and was saved from insolvency by public donations. Under Mr Batten's leadership, membership has increased from a low of around 18,000 to approximately 24,000, according to UKIP, but critics have accused the party of becoming too right-wing. The party's interim manifesto includes sections on free speech, political correctness and Islamic extremism, as well as the NHS, defence, education and policing among others. It urges a \"complete and total withdrawal from the European Union\", and says UKIP will keep fighting to make the UK an \"independent, self-governing, sovereign state\", regardless of any Brexit deal reached. In it, Mr Batten says UKIP will \"promote and defend our national and individual freedoms\" adding: \"We are determined to protect our freedom of speech and the right to speak our minds without fear of the politically correct thought-police knocking on our doors.\" The manifesto covers a wide range of policy areas, from the NHS and transport to fisheries and small businesses, with policies including: Mr Batten, who took over as leader in February but has said he will not stand as a candidate in the next general election, said UKIP had a \"unique opportunity\" to change the UK for the better.

The iPhone X, which retails for \u00a3999, is the most expensive handset yet by Apple. The California-based firm also sells computers, iPads, and makes revenue from apps. With the launch of the iPhone 8 and X handsets, Apple is now valued at nearly $900bn (\u00a3690bn). The company is now closer to becoming the first trillion dollar company, as shares rose 2%. With the iPhone 8 and X handsets now on sale, Mr Cook predicted Apple's \"biggest quarter ever\" in the three months to the end of the year. Shoppers queued up at Apple stores in dozens of countries, as the high-end iPhone X launched on Friday. The iPhone X abandons the signature \"home\" button and can be unlocked with face-scanning technology, among other new features. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, said the company was \"firing on all cylinders,\" thanks to a sales rebound in China, record purchases through the App Store, and robust demand for its latest iPhone models. The company sold more than 46.6 million phones in the July to September period, up 3% year-on-year. That produced $28.8bn, or more than half of its revenue. Other products, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, also did well, growing in the double digits. The firm got another boost from its services division, which includes the App store, Apple Pay, and its music subscriptions service. That unit made $8.5bn in the quarter, up 34% year-on-year, thanks in part to a one-time adjustment. Though its costs increased, Apple said profits were $10.7bn in the quarter, increasing 18%. The company expects to make between $84bn and $87bn in revenue in the upcoming quarter, a record for the company. Mr Cook said the iPhone X positioned Apple ahead of the curve when it comes to new augmented reality or AR technology.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com October 10, 2019, 12:38 am ad1c9bdddf","315":"The article is about Australian singer Dami Im's Eurovision song, Sound Of Silence.

In previous years, entrants have been forced to rewrite songs which fell foul of the Eurovision rulebook. San Marino's 2012 entry, Facebook Uh, Oh, Oh (A Satirical Song) was renamed The Social Network Song (Oh Oh Uh Oh Oh) after organizers intervened. And in 2005, Ukraine had to rewrite the lyrics to Razom Nas Bagato!, which had become the anthem of the country's \"orange revolution\" a year earlier. The song, whose title translated as Together We Are Many!, included such phrases as \"Yushchenko - yes! Yushchenko - yes!

The ALR submarine is capable of diving to a depth of 4,000 meters below the surface and has been used to acquire a remarkable set of new data on the movement of deep, cold water. The submarine is named after the winning entry in a public poll to name the UK's future \u00a3200m polar research vessel, but the government felt that it was inappropriate to use the name for the vessel itself. The ALR submarine is part of a class of three robots developed by the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in the UK, and the Antarctic venture was the first full science expedition using the submarine. The submarine was programmed to swim through a narrow gap in the ocean-floor ridge that extends northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula, known as the Orkney Passage, a critical \"valve\" in the so-called \"great ocean conveyor\" - the relentless system of deep circulation that helps redistribute all the heat energy that has built up in the climate system. There is evidence that this flow of bottom-water is warming, perhaps because of a strengthening of the winds over the Southern Ocean. Prof Alberto Naveira-Garabato from the University of Southampton, the lead scientist for the investigations conducted from the deck of the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross, is pleased with Boaty's performance. The submarine was able to make a total of three dives, reaching down to 4,000m below the surface, and covering 180km. Boaty flew through some very strong currents, very close to the ocean bottom and encountered some really steep terrain. The submarine was able to acquire a remarkable set of new data on the movement of deep, cold water.","326":"Andrew Bulloch\u2019s interest in photography was sparked by a wild camping trip with his family to Rannoch Moor four years ago.

The article provides a summary of the key points in the text and highlights the impact of the decision on the United States. The article also discusses the impact of the decision on the global community and the implications of the withdrawal for the future of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe article begins by discussing the announcement made by President Trump to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. The announcement was made at an energy conference in Pittsburgh, and President Trump was flanked by men in hard hats. He described the accord as a bad deal and said that his pro-fossil fuel policies had made the United States an energy superpower. The earliest he could formally start the process of withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement was 4 November. The pull-out would take effect a year later - the day after the 2020 US presidential election.\n\nThe Paris Agreement brought together 195 nations in the battle to combat climate change. It committed the United States to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. President Trump said that if he couldn\u2019t improve that deal, he would pull out. However, diplomatic sources said that there had been no major effort at renegotiation.\n\nThe article then discusses the seek-and-destroy mission conducted by the president\u2019s staff through US environmental legislation. Mr Trump promised that he would turn the United States into an energy superpower, and he attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil, and coal. Mr Trump categorised former US President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy.\n\nThe gas and oil industries are indeed thriving, but Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to resurrect the coal industry has proved much more challenging. Coal can\u2019t compete on price with gas - or, for that matter, with renewables whose costs have plummeted. Firms are also reluctant to invest billions in coal-fired plants that could have a limited life if the next administration rejoins the rest of the world on climate change.\n\nAs coal is the dirtiest fuel, the industry\u2019s woes have held down US emissions, despite the President\u2019s policies.

The men were trapped by a cave-in at a gypsum mine in eastern Shandong province on 25 December. Of 29 initially trapped, 15 have been rescued and one is confirmed dead, while 13 are still missing. The footage, released by Chinese authorities, showed miners named as Hua Mingxi, 36, Zhao Zhicheng, 50, Li Qiusheng, 39, and Guan Qinji, 58, addressing rescuers. \"Thank you all very much, I feel relieved and secure now,\" says one man through his tears. \"We will remember you all forever,\" says another. The phone had been sent down some days earlier with video of the rescue operation, in order to give the men hope. More than 400 rescue workers were involved in the operation to reach the men, who were trapped more than 200m (656ft) underground. A borehole was drilled down to the shaft and water and liquids were passed through. Finally on Friday, the miners were winched up one-by-one in a specially made capsule.

Luke Somerfield, from Ffairfach, near Llandeilo, was flown to Morriston Hospital, Swansea, but died later. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances. The quarry owners, Tarmac, confirmed there had been an incident at the quarry, which they described as a closed site. They said the death resulted from a young boy falling into the water, and that their deepest sympathies were with his family and friends. Police are working to establish the details of the incident and are working in collaboration with other agencies to support the boy's family. The quarry, which is no longer being worked, has high walls with a lake at the base.

The center is losing money and needs capital investment. GLL has announced that they will \"surrender their lease\" back to the landlord, Seven Capital. This has led to more than 2,000 people signing a petition to bring the center back into public ownership. At a recent council meeting, more than 70 members of the public appealed to the council leader, David Renard, to secure the center's future by bringing it back into public ownership. They said the center was \"built with public money, for public ownership\" and that the people of Swindon deserve clarity on the council's agreement with Seven Capital. The council leader said there were provisions for the center to revert back to council ownership, but he did not see any need for that at this stage. He also said that Seven Capital has an obligation to find someone else to take on the center and make the necessary investment.","334":"The author says that India's internal affairs minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said that the LTTE should first lay down their arms and state their willingness for talks. He also said that Sri Lanka government should also stop all military operations. The author strongly criticised the activities of the LTTE during the past decades. He said that the LTTE wanted to create a dictatorship in Sri Lanka eliminating the moderate Tamil leadership. \"Tamil leaders were killed one by one. Tamil ethnic leadership was destroyed by the Tamil Tigers because they wanted to make Prabhakaran as the only leader and LTTE as the only movement for Tamils,\" the minister said. The minister also said that assassination of many Tamil leaders was the \"biggest blunder\" by LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and it is \"still haunting\" him.

Noriega was the key figure in Panama from 1983 to 1989, and was a close ally of the United States in Central America for several decades. His connection with the United States dates back to the 1950s, when he was recruited as a CIA informant while studying at a military academy in Peru. Noriega rose through the ranks of the Panamanian armed forces and became a key supporter of General Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the United States in 1977 to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty. After Torrijos's death in 1981, Noriega became the power behind the scenes as head of the security services.\n\nThe US relied on Panama as a regional listening post and Noriega obliged with unfaltering support for the Contras in Nicaragua and in the fight against the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador. However, the US became increasingly suspicious of Noriega amid indications that he was selling his services to other intelligence bodies, not to mention drug-trafficking organisations.\n\nIn 1988, Noriega was indicted in a US federal court on drug-trafficking charges and was also accused of rigging elections in 1989. By mid-December 1989, ties between the United States and Panama had deteriorated so far that President George H W Bush launched an invasion, ostensibly because a US marine had been killed in Panama City.\n\nIn conclusion, Manuel Noriega was a key figure in Panama for several decades, and was a close ally of the United States in Central America. However, his connections with other intelligence bodies and his involvement in drug-trafficking ultimately led to a deterioration of relations between the United States and Panama, culminating in a US invasion in 1989.","336":"- The Swindon Designer Outlet will add 50,000 sq ft of retail space to the shopping center and bring an estimated 350 new jobs.\n- The Long Shop building, built in 1874 as part of the Grade II-listed Great Western Railway Works, will be converted to provide 30 new shops.\n- Grouping brands: Conversion work is expected to be completed in autumn 2014.\n- The Designer Outlet, which currently offers 207,000 sq ft of retail space, is home to more than 90 factory outlet stores including Hugo Boss, Jaeger and LK Bennett.\n- The new development is part of a larger plan which includes making shopping easier by grouping similar retail brands together in special zones.\n- The centre, which is owned by Henderson Global Investors and managed by McArthur Glen, was built inside the former Great Western Railway Works and opened in 1997.\n\nArticle:\n\nThe development will add 50,000 sq ft of retail space to the shopping centre and bring an estimated 350 extra jobs.

The protesters have been camping outside the police station for two days and blocked a major highway on Monday. 51 protesters were arrested on Monday night. Police have released few details about the shooting of Clark, who some say was handcuffed when he was shot. Police have denied the claim that Clark was handcuffed. The protests have led to the mayor's decision to ask the federal government to launch a civil rights investigation. The mayor said that the city needs \"all the tools we have available to us\" in order to ensure transparency and community confidence. The police chief has said that the officers involved in the shooting are on paid leave, which is standard procedure after incidents such as this. The police department has not released any video of the situation, and the officers involved have not been identified. The protesters have welcomed the federal investigation, but have vowed to continue demonstrating until any video of the situation is released and the officers involved are identified. The protests began on Sunday and included an overnight encampment at a Minneapolis police station near the scene of the shooting. At least eight tents were seen at the campsite on Monday, and a few protesters were sitting inside the glass doors of the station - including one who was knitting. \"We're still not moving until we get that footage,\" said Michael McDowell, a demonstrator with the Black Lives Matter movement. According to police, the incident began early on Sunday when police were called to north Minneapolis following the report of an assault. At the scene, police found Clark unconscious, with no pulse, and he was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The police department has not released any information about the officers involved in the shooting, or any video of the situation.","342":"OECD says that \"caution\" is needed in the roll-out of the policy. Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged to raise the wage to \u00a37.50 an hour next April. The OECD also forecast that the UK would have one of the lowest growth rates among G20 countries by 2018. The National Living Wage was introduced by Chancellor George Osborne in his Budget in July 2015. It came into effect in April this year, and was set at a rate of \u00a37.20 an hour for workers aged 25 and over, with the aim of increasing it to \u00a39 an hour by 2020. Pay rise The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility estimated it would give a pay rise to 1.3 million workers this year. The OECD said the UK's labour market had been \"resilient\", although job creation had moderated recently. \"Real wages have been growing at a time of low inflation, but the fall of the exchange rate has started to increase price pressures,\" it said. \"Caution is needed with the implementation of the policy to raise the National Living Wage to 60% of median hourly earnings by 2020. \"The effects on employment need to be carefully assessed before any further increases are adopted, especially as growth slows and labour markets weaken.\" The organisation's stance echoes the widespread claims of business organisations in the 1990s that the introduction of the UK's national minimum wage - which started in 1999 - would lead to widespread job losses.

The tax was implemented to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks and to encourage healthier eating habits. The government has been considering extending the scope of the sugar tax to flavoured milk drinks, which were left out of the tax net when it was first announced in 2016. George Osborne, who was the chancellor of the exchequer when the sugar tax was introduced, has indicated that he wishes he had gone further at the outset and included sugary milk drinks in the tax net. He has suggested that current cabinet members should move more rapidly on this issue.\n\nIn addition to the sugar tax, the government is also implementing a sugar reformulation plan. This plan is aimed at products not covered by the soft drinks levy, such as cakes, biscuits, and cereals. The government has reached an agreement with the food and retail industries to reduce the sugar content of these food items by 20% over four years. The first year of the plan has been completed, and public health officials are currently analysing market sales data to determine whether companies in each category are cutting sugar content in line with the target. It is reported that the sugar content removed by the food and restaurant industries in the first year has fallen short of the required 5%.\n\nOverall, the government is taking steps to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks and to encourage healthier eating habits. The sugar tax and sugar reformulation plan are two of the initiatives being implemented to achieve this goal. However, critics argue that the progress made by the food and retail industries in reducing sugar content has been slower than expected.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com October 16, 2022, 12:49 pm ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/business\/public-health\/sugar-tax-and-sugar-reformulation-plan-514136\n\nThe solution provides a summary of the article, \"Sugar tax and sugar reformulation plan\" by Hugh Pym.\n\n$2.19\n\n1.

The allegations of sexual abuse against children by Savile prompted more than 100 people to come forward to the police, giving accounts of how they were sexually abused by Savile on NHS premises and in other places. The Department of Health asked hospital trusts to investigate and appointed Kate Lampard QC to oversee the independent hospital investigations. The findings of inquiries at 28 hospitals - including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital - were published in June 2014. Since then, a further wave of allegations emerged at some of the original 28 hospitals, and a further eight hospitals and one ambulance service. Fresh investigations were carried out and reports were published. The reports on 28 hospitals found the late DJ subjected patients, visitors, and staff across the country to \"truly awful\" sexual abuse for more than four decades. Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary ranged from five-year-olds to 75-year-olds, and included men, women, boys, and girls. The allegations included rapes. At high-security hospital Broadmoor, Savile sexually abused at least five individuals, including two patients who were subjected to repeated assaults. The reports found failings at the hospitals in the way complaints were passed on and how access to wards was controlled. How else did police respond to the ITV report claims? In 2012, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation called Operation Yewtree - following the broadcast of the ITV documentary.

However, Asian economies are not as affected by this as one might think. Firstly, the stock market crash has had a knock-on effect on commodity prices, and some Asian currencies have touched multi-year lows. Secondly, there was incompetence on the part of the Chinese government in their inability to halt the market slide despite pumping in an estimated $200bn. Thirdly, the IMF has acknowledged that global growth will be affected by what happens in China, as it makes up such a large part of the global economy. However, many economists believe that Asia will ride it out. To understand why, we must look back to 2008 and the last financial crisis. S&P estimates that Asia's economic growth before the crisis was 5.5%, of which a fifth was driven by external demand from the US and Europe.

It also wants to re-route Victory Road, which currently divides Rolls-Royce in half, to create one unified campus. A consultation has been launched and plans for the road are expected to be submitted by March. Work on the campus is not expected to start before 2017. A spokeswoman said: \"We have been based in the city since 1906 and some of the buildings on our main Derby site are many years old and no longer fit for purpose. \"We need to modernise our facilities to help us continue to be competitive and continue to meet the needs of our customers.\" The change to the site is to begin with moving Victory Road so it runs round the north east edge of Rolls-Royce. The firm aims to apply for planning permission in March, following the public consultation which runs this month, with work expected in July 2016. More detailed proposals for changes to the campus have yet to be finalised but it expects modern buildings in a \"parkland setting\". Rolls-Royce said the long-term plan, which could take more than a decade to complete, relied on getting planning consent and the company's continued ability to invest.\n\nLast edited by a moderator:","350":"Carwyn Jones announced an extra \u00a310m to help the 7,000 under-25s who seek help with homelessness every year.

The park authority's planning committee gave its approval at it first live-streamed public meeting. It was held online due to lockdown restrictions. Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), which owns the railway, said it was pleased to gain the planning permission.

Her sister-in-law, Rebecca Jones, a GP who works in Cwmbran, Torfaen, has called on the Foreign Office to \"publicly condemn\" what has happened. The Foreign Office has supported the family since the arrest, but Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in September on charges that have not been disclosed. An appeal was launched but the ruling was upheld in January. Dr Jones believes it would be \"nice\" if someone high up in the government publicly condemned what's happened to her sister-in-law. She also criticised the Foreign Office for not standing up and publicly condemning the miscarriage of justice. Dr Jones added that politically there's a lot going on in Iran at the moment, and the UK government wants trade deals with Iran.

London Underground said at the time of the incident the platform was not overcrowded and a full investigation was under way into what happened.

Pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners criticised the compromise that sealed the deal set to be signed into law by President Jose Mujica. The proposal had already been approved by the lower house of Congress and the Senate, but politicians from both sides of the debate agreed further changes and held another vote. Abortions versus adoptions Pro-choice campaigners say many lives will be saved with the end of clandestine, high-risk terminations. \"With this law, we are joining the ranks of developed countries that have largely adopted a stance to liberalise, recognising the failure of criminal laws to avoid abortions,\" said government Senator Luis Gallo. Pro-choice campaigners reject changes to the proposal that forces women to justify before a panel of experts why they wish a termination. After that, they will need to wait for several days - a period of reflection - before being able to state their final decision. Anti-abortion politicians said the government should have adopted measures to encourage adoptions, rather than change the law. \"Abortion is not a medical act. It does not seek to protect and preserve a patient's health,\" said opposition Senator Alfredo Solari. Abortion is legal and available on request in Cuba. Abortion is also allowed up to the 12th week of pregnancy in many Mexican states and in the area of the capital, Mexico City. In other Latin American countries, it is only allowed in cases of rape or health risk for the woman.","361":"The article discusses the proposed legislation for 999 workers.

The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) criticized the changes. In January, the bank told Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee that it would invest in its mobile banking fleet. Colin Borland, FSB's head of devolved nations, said RBS made an argument that the impact of Scottish branch closures would be mitigated by \"smart\" ATMs and mobile van bank services. But he said that it now appeared to be that because more branches were closing mobile van services would be \"spread even more thinly - making it harder for local businesses and consumers to access banking services\". Mr Borland said: \"RBS looks again like it is trying to cut services that customers find valuable. \"This move also seems to clash with evidence RBS chiefs gave to MPs in January, where they talked up investment in their mobile bank fleet. \"It wouldn't surprise me if MPs on the Scottish Affairs Committee will be keen to get to the bottom of this when they take evidence from RBS chief, Ross McEwan, next month.\" A Royal Bank of Scotland spokesperson said: \"Our customers have many different ways to bank with us.

Manufacturers also recorded a drop in order book volumes for the 15th consecutive month. This report suggests that the overall rise was linked to stronger demand in the latest RBS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). RBS said the November data highlighted \"some positive signs\" for the Scottish private sector, including a \"moderate\" increase in staffing levels after four months of decline. Its index - which measures manufacturing and service sector output - posted 50.9 last month, up from 49.6 in October. Any figure above 50 suggests expansion. The survey indicated that \"overall demand conditions\" rebounded in November, with incoming new business rising following three successive monthly falls. The rise in Scotland was the second-fastest of the 12 monitored UK areas, behind only London. That said, the increase was relatively \"subdued\", with some respondents noting that \"continued uncertainty\" had weighed on growth. On a positive note, the November data indicated improved business confidence towards activity over the next 12 months. 'Continued uncertainty' RBS Scotland Board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said: \"Nevertheless, uncertainty continued to subdue demand, with client hesitancy reportedly weighing heavily on both output and activity. \"A clearer outlook is required to boost demand and for the Scottish private sector to gain further momentum in the closing stages of the year.\" Revised figures recently released by the Scottish government indicated that Scotland's economy shrank slightly less between April and June than first thought. They showed output (GDP) contracted by 0.2% over that period instead of 0.3% as initially predicted.

Ms Colau announced on Thursday that people in Barcelona would be able to vote without civil servants involved risking their jobs but did not explain how. 'It won't happen' On Friday, the Spanish government gave the regional government 48 hours to abandon its \"illegal\" referendum plans or lose budgetary powers. \"If, 48 hours from now, there's no compromise that falls within the law, from then on the Spanish government will take over responsibility for making Catalonia's payments,\" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy later told a meeting of his Popular Party in Barcelona. \"My friends, I say this both calmly and firmly: there will be no referendum, it won't happen.\" Mr Rajoy also announced that police from Spain's national Guardia Civil force had seized 100,000 referendum posters. No government in the world, he said, could accept such a challenge to the rule of law.","370":"1.

It is expected that most of the central belt will be placed in level three, as could Dundee. The exceptions could be North and South Lanarkshire, which may go into the highest level four category due to concerns about their high number of cases and hospital admissions. If the area is placed in level four, bars and restaurants would remain closed while gyms, swimming pools and other indoor leisure facilities would only be open for elite athletes. People would only be able to meet one other person from one other household outdoors. If the area is placed in level three, pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to open but will only be able to serve alcohol with a meal.

The Independent Office for Police Investigation (IOPC) found that the vehicle was traveling at an appropriate speed for the call. An inquest jury returned a conclusion of misadventure into the death. A narrative, given alongside the verdict following the five-day hearing at Warwickshire Justice Centre, said Ms Whitehead, who had been crossing Coventry Road, \"entered the road carriageway of her own volition, solely in control of her scooter.\" Died in hospital \"Several witnesses gave evidence and confirmed that they heard sirens and saw flashing lights from the police car in question,\" it said. Police officers gave first aid at the scene prior to the arrival of paramedics but Ms Whitehead died in hospital, the IOPC said. Its investigation found that the police car was traveling at appropriate speed for the response, around 65 mph on the 50 mph limit carriageway before the officer braked, immediately before the collision, on seeing the scooter enter the road. It said the police car had been responding to a report of an oil leak from a broken-down crane on a road near Nuneaton, causing a dangerous hazard at a bend. IOPC regional director, Derrick Campbell, said: \"I again send my sympathies to the family and friends of Jessie Whitehead and everyone affected by this terribly sad event. \"The officer was suitably trained and qualified and sadly, despite efforts to brake, could not have avoided the tragic collision.\"","377":"Article:\nCeredigion council wants to end a \u00a356,000 grant to the Mid Wales Entertainment Circuit (MWEC). The council claims the move will impact less than cutting individual grants. But bosses at one of the eight theatres affected claims the authority has been \"misinformed\". The plan to withdraw funds from the MWEC is part of its proposals to save \u00a39.6m during the next financial year and \u00a320.85m over the next three years. MWEC has been in existence since 1982 and is a consortium of eight theatres in Ceredigion, Powys and Gwynedd.

Sangin has been a battleground between the Afghan government and the Taliban for years, with both sides vying for control of the area. The Taliban recently recaptured Sangin and is now poised to recapture the district from Afghan forces. This would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces. Sangin is also a rich opium production center, meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The article notes that the Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied rather than fully control them, as they can easily be targeted. However, they may have an advantage among the local population in Sangin, who are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year. The Taliban is likely to seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible. The article concludes that if the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, it should look to win hearts and minds, deploying troops who do not bear the grudges of those who fought in the civil war in the 90s, and soldiers who are not","385":"The article talks about the rise of Ante Gotovina, a French legionnaire who went on to become the pinnacle of Croatian nationalism.

They claim that the compensation they have received has been inadequate given the risks involved. It is the first time Tepco has faced legal action from Fukushima workers over pay and working conditions. The lawsuit was filed by two current and two former workers at the Fukushima plant. Tepco had no immediate comment. The workers fear that their health may be harmed in the future and they believe that there are many people who cannot speak out about this kind of problem. They worry that they may be fired or given no further work, but they hope that people will take this opportunity to speak up and get paid. Fukushima fallout The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors went into meltdown after a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 knocked out reactor cooling systems at the plant. Subsequent radiation leaks made the surrounding areas around the plant unfit for habitation. Tens of thousands of people had to leave their homes and businesses because of radioactive contamination, with the majority still unable to return home. The facility is operated by Tepco, which has spent billions of dollars on the clean-up and decommissioning of the plant. About 6,000 people have been working at the plant daily over the last two months, and the lawsuit is demanding that they either be paid directly by Tepco or the government. However, many are employed by contractors and subcontractors. Our correspondent says that there have long been complaints that many subcontractors are not paying their workers properly, and allegations that some are connected to Japan's Yakuza crime gangs.

The play is set on an island off the west coast of Ireland called Inisduill, which is a metaphor for pre-boom Ireland. The story revolves around a modest couple and the arrival of an ambitious relative. The relative sets up the first branch of Anglo Irish Bank on the island and persuades them to borrow 890 million euros to build an apartment and shopping complex on the island. It is the story of how it unravels from there for them, for the bank and for the country as well. The tagline of the play is 'It only takes a few muppets to screw an entire country'. The play highlights the folly of Ireland's Celtic Tiger years and the parody of the folly of Ireland's 'Celtic Tiger' years. The writer admits that it was difficult to parody the folly of Ireland's 'Celtic Tiger' years because the reality was \"so insane\". The writer explains that there is a bar in Dublin that during the years of the Celtic Tiger was selling a cocktail called 'Minted' made up of 200-year old brandy, fine champagne and gold flakes on the top. A 'Minted' cocktail cost 750 euros at a time and the writer observed that a lot of bankers were drinking them. The writer also explains that satire and parody are about finding something that is true and distorting it slightly and creating a cartoon image of it. But there was so much of what happened during the Celtic Tiger that it was difficult to improve on in comic terms. The play also highlights the irony of the situation where the government has to bail out the bank and the bankers, who had created the situation in the first place, are not held accountable for their actions.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the primary theme of Anglo the Musical?","391":"Article:\nOn Friday night, Labour took Kensington and Chelsea by just 20 votes following a third recount.

He called for the repeal of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, and urged Congress to pass a sentencing reform bill by the end of the year. The president also said that African Americans and Latinos are disproportionately represented in the prison population. On Monday, Mr Obama commuted the sentences of 46 prisoners, many of whom were serving time for nonviolent drug offences.

The article concludes by mentioning that the criminal justice system has been a subject of rare agreement between Republicans and Democrats in Congress.","398":"The article discusses the privacy of personal messages sent by employees during work hours. It mentions that employers have the right to read Yahoo Messenger chats, sent by an employee while at work. The author suggests that the decision made by the judges was within their rights. The article also states that where to draw the line with personal messages at work depends on the policy of the company. Felicity Carroll, a lawyer, explains that if the policy has a blanket rule that no social media is to be used, or no personal messages would be sent during work hours and that was breached, it would give the employer grounds to build a case against the employee. The article further mentions that the arrangement is simple and on agreeing to a contract, one agrees to the employer's rules and the employer agrees to pay the employee. The author also states that there are still barriers to protect the privacy of employees. It mentions that employers cannot go into the Facebook or log in as the employee and look at the messages. The article suggests that it's worth staying on top of social media and being clear about what one can and cannot do. It also mentions that the law does permit the employer to use information that's used on social media, that's used on Facebook, within their ability to use that as evidence. The article provides an insight into the privacy of personal messages sent by employees during work hours. It mentions the importance of having clear policies and guidelines in place to avoid any miscommunication or misunderstanding. The article also emphasizes the need to stay on top of social media and be aware of the legal implications of using it.","399":"The Public Services Department's Ports Master Plan prioritises building a berth and improving facilities for freight and commercial fishermen. Currently, some ships carrying freight rest on the seabed in the harbours when the tide is out. President Steve Champion-Smith said it is important that ships are no longer built to sit on the bottom. He said in order to get larger, more conventional vessels in, a deep-water berth is required. The \u00a390,000 report by consultants Moffat and Nichol was commissioned by the States and involved a public consultation. Ideas explored in the document include moving the passenger terminal in St Peter Port, creating more parking on North Beach, and a cruise liner berth. Mr Champion-Smith said it would be great to achieve everything on the list and it would be great to go away and achieve that within five years, but it is economy-driven. He said of a cruise liner berth: \"If the island finds itself in a cash-rich position and the capital expenditure makes sense in terms of a return and current demand as it either grows or declines... then it could be built.\" Mr Champion-Smith said work to improve some of the commercial areas of the harbours had already begun and would result in \"a safer working area and environment for everyone.\" However, the department behind the plan has not been able to reveal if any clear proposals will be formulated or when the matter will be debated by the States.\n\n#### Top Answer\n\nThe Public Services Department's Ports Master Plan prioritizes building the berth and improving facilities for...

Detectives have previously won legal battles to secure the transcripts and tapes of interviews given by former IRA woman Dolours Price and ex-loyalist prisoner Winston \"Winkie\" Rea. A subpoena seeking copies of Mr McIntyre's interviews has been served on Boston College by the British government, and the ILOR is part of this. Mr McIntyre's lawyers say the tapes only contain details of offences for which he had already served a prison sentence. Lord Justices Weatherup and Weir heard that Boston College had released the tapes to the US authorities. They stressed that if PSNI officers travelled to the US, it would be \"necessary for the US authorities to be informed of the presence of the police officers in their territory.\" They also stressed that the US would \"undoubtedly\" require advance notice if the officers were to travel to the US. The PSNI have argued that they need the tapes as part of their investigation into alleged terrorist offences, including a bomb explosion at Rugby Avenue in Belfast in 1976 and membership of a terrorist organisation. They also argued that the PSNI's investigation is ongoing and that they believe Mr McIntyre was involved in the bombing. The judge said that if the PSNI was \"unable to justify their request to the US authorities for the disclosure of material which would constitute a criminal offence in the US, then the PSNI would be unable to justify their request to the court.\" The judge also stressed that the PSNI must show that the offences being investigated were not already known to them. The PSNI said that they believed that Mr McIntyre was involved in the bombing, but Mr McIntyre's lawyers said that he was the victim in the bombing and he was acquitted of the membership charge. They also argued that the PSNI had not carried out a \"scrupulous\" examination of the information in the request.","405":"Article:\nBy Jennifer McKiernanBBC News NI\nThe art project aims to highlight how self-isolation has cut some older people off from everyday interactions.

However, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that Beckham\u2019s appeal to children had diminished due to his shift from football to commercial ventures and retirement from the sport. This ruling was made in response to a complaint from Alcohol Concern, which pointed out Beckham\u2019s involvement in the Sainsbury\u2019s Active Kids campaign and his role as a Unicef goodwill ambassador. Despite this, the ASA concluded that Beckham\u2019s appeal to children was not strong enough to warrant regulation. Diageo, the company that developed the drink, agreed with the ASA\u2019s decision and stated that Beckham\u2019s fans were mostly adults.\n\nAlcohol Concern disagreed with the ASA\u2019s ruling and stated that Beckham\u2019s appeal to children was still significant, given his other roles promoting sport and the importance of a healthy lifestyle.

The American actor Debbie Allen announced his death on Twitter, saying she was \"blessed to have been so close\" to him. In a statement, music producer Quincy Jones said: \"There are no words to convey how much my heart aches with the news of the passing of my baby brother James Ingram. With that soulful, whisky-sounding voice, James Ingram was simply magical.\" Entertainment news site TMZ said Ingram had been suffering from brain cancer. Born in Ohio in 1952, Ingram later moved to Los Angeles and began his career with the band Revelation Funk. He also played keyboards for Ray Charles before his own musical career took off. He performed vocals on Quincy Jones' 1981 album The Dude and won the Best Male R&B Vocal Performance Grammy for the song One Hundred Ways the following year, when he was also nominated for Best New Artist. Ingram won his second Grammy for the song Yah Mo B There which he sang with Michael McDonald - but in the UK, he was best known for Somewhere Out There, a duet with Linda Ronstadt from the children's film An American Tail. The track reached number eight in 1987 - his only UK top 10 hit - and went on to beat U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For to win best song at the 1988 Grammys. However, his solo albums failed to match the success of his duets; and he stopped releasing new albums in the early 1990s, turning his attention to film soundtracks, with great success. Ingram received Oscar nominations in 1994 and 1995 for The Day I Fall In Love, a duet with Dolly Parton from Beethoven's 2nd, and Look What Love Has Done, from the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy Junior.

Prof Nic Timpson said the team wants to understand how the virus spreads from infected people who have no symptoms. The Bristol-based project also aims to record the impact of staying at home on people's finances, fitness and health.\n\n'Subtle ways'\n\n\"It is important is to understand how it travels through the population - who is harbouring the disease without knowing it and how risky it is to allow those people to carry on doing their ordinary life things,\" said Prof Timpson. Once a suitable antibody test is available researchers hope to test participants to find out what proportion have had Covid-19 but were unaware of it. The study will also look at the social effects of lockdown. Prof Timpson said many people will have had their lives \"turned upside down\". \"All this will have a very different effect on people, both in a practical way thinking about finance and the way families work, but also in more subtle ways to do with people's behaviour, their fitness and health but also their mental health.\"\n\nTrainee teacher, Lydia Blakemore Phillips was one of the original children of the 90s.

It has been celebrated by Jews since about 1300 BC.\nAt the beginning of Passover, families and friends will get together for an evening meal and a special service called a Seder. However, this year's celebration will be \"very different and very challenging\" due to social distancing. The Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis said this will be a one-off, and things will be back to usual next year.\nPassover is a time when many generations of families would usually gather around the table, but this year they will be separated from other members of their families. The Chief Rabbi is impressed with how people have helped others, taking them parcels of food and guaranteeing that those who are by themselves should never actually feel alone.\nIn the borough of Barnet, there are more than 54,000 Jews living, making up 20% of the total English and Welsh Jewish population. Rabbi Miriam Berger, of the Finchley Reform Synagogue, said members of the Jewish community had rallied around to make sure nobody was alone ahead of Passover.\nOur community has been incredible,\" rabbi Berger said. \"Since the bird flu epidemic we have had some services online and found we can interact with people all around the world - so we had a bit of a running start. But we have had to adhere so quickly to these changes and we have teams of volunteers split up into three groups to help within the community.","424":"By Anna HolliganTechnology of Business reporter His company, in partnership with the airport's owners, is planning the world's first commercial production of jet fuel made, in part, from carbon dioxide (CO2). Based at the airport, it will work by capturing CO2, the gas which contributes to global warming, from the air. In a separate process, co-electrolysis splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is mixed with the captured CO2 to form syngas, which can be transformed into jet fuel. The pilot plant, which aims to produce 1,000 litres of jet fuel a day, will get its energy from solar panels. The partners in the project hope to produce the first fuel in 2021. They argue that their jet fuel will have a much smaller CO2 impact than regular fuel. \"The beauty of direct air capture is that the CO2 is reused again, and again, and again,\" says Louise Charles, from Climeworks, the company which provides the direct air capture technology. Oskar admits that the fuel has a long way to go before it is competitive. \"The main element is the cost,\" Oskar Meijerink, from SkyNRG, concedes. \"Fossil jet fuel is relatively inexpensive. Capturing CO2 from the air is still a nascent technology and expensive.\" Other companies are working on similar direct capture systems, including Carbon Engineering in Canada and US-based Global Thermostat. But environmental campaigners are highly sceptical. \"It sure does sound amazing. It sounds like a solution to all of our problems - except that it's not,\" said Jorien de Lege from Friends of the Earth. \"If you think about it, this demonstration plant can produce a thousand litres a day based on renewable energy. That's about five minutes of flying in a Boeing 747. \"It'd be a mistake to think that we can keep flying the way that we do because we can fly on air. That's never going to happen. It's always going to be a niche.\" While companies are experimenting with high tech ways to capture CO2 from the air, there's already a technology which can do so: trees.

It is also claimed he groped patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Bucks, where he was a volunteer fundraiser. Meanwhile a newspaper report that Savile abused a patient at Broadmoor is being investigated by its NHS trust. The Sun claimed he assaulted a 17-year-old patient during a visit as a hospital fundraiser in the 1970s. But West London Mental Health NHS Trust said it had not been approached by police or any former patients or their representatives with any allegations. The Metropolitan Police is now leading an inquiry into claims of abuse against the Leeds-born presenter and is pursuing 120 separate lines of inquiry. A further two forces have referred a total of three new complaints to Scotland Yard, it has emerged. The BBC will also hold an inquiry into allegations Savile abused girls while working for the corporation after the police investigation is completed. A figure from outside the corporation will chair it. 'Nasty, horrible man' Savile had a long-association with the Leeds General Infirmary which included him volunteering during the 1960s and 70s and undertaking charity work until his death in October 2011. At one time he also worked as a porter at the hospital. Former patient June Thornton said that when she was recovering from an operation there in May 1972 she saw Savile molest a brain-damaged girl. \"I thought at the time that he was a relative but then he started kissing her neck, running his hands up and down her arms and then started to molest her,\" she said. \"Now I just need him to be seen for what he is, a nasty, horrible man to a very vulnerable young lady.

He was hospitalized at the Rio Piedras medical center in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

His eldest son, Hector Jr., had indicated that he wanted to keep his father alive, but his mother had the final say. The former boxer was shot in the head on December 12 outside a bar in his home city of Bayamon, outside the capital, San Juan. His friend Adrian Mojica Moreno was killed in the attack. Police said the car contained bags of cocaine at the time of the shooting, but they did not know of any motives behind the attack.\n\nM\u00e1rquez was known for his flamboyant style and skill in the ring. He was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in New York where he made his professional debut in 1980. He went on to win four world titles across three weight divisions, beginning with the WBC super featherweight title in 1983. His last fight was an attempt at a comeback against Saul Duran in 2010, which he lost. By then he had become known for his troubled personal life and run-ins with the police.

It is thought that the virus killed 200,000 people around the world. The study looked at more than 90,000 blood samples before and during the pandemic in countries including India, Australia and the UK. It showed large numbers of people had been infected, although not all would have developed full-blown flu. The H1N1 virus first appeared in Mexico in 2009 and rapidly spread around the world. The study looked for antibodies which are produced when the body is infected with H1N1. By comparing the figures before and during the pandemic, the researchers could determine how many people were infected as the virus spread around the world. Approximately 24% of people had been infected overall, but half of school-age children showed signs of infection. One of the researchers, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove from Imperial College London, said fewer than two in every 10,000 people infected died during the pandemic. However, those that did die are much younger than in seasonal flu so the years of life lost will be much more. The figures drive home how incredibly infectious the virus is. Many older people, who typically die during outbreaks of flu, were protected as they had been exposed to the virus decades before. Professor John Oxford, a virology expert at Queen Mary, University of London, said the figures \"make sense\". \"It was the busiest virus on the block and it displaced other influenza viruses - it was the only virus in town.\" He said a similar pattern would be expected in other countries which were not analysed in the study.","435":"Christine's son Tristram, who is now 22, has Foetal Valproate Spectrum Disorder, which has led to developmental problems, autism, and communication difficulties. Tristram requires 24-hour-a-day supervision, as he is unable to cross a road by himself. Christine loves the young man her son has become but feels sad about the challenges he faces. She felt angry when she realized that the medication she was prescribed, sodium valproate, had known problems. Problems with sodium valproate were first identified in the 1970s, but restrictions were not placed on its use until two years ago. The MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) said that up to four in 10 babies are at risk of developmental disorders if sodium valproate is taken during pregnancy, and one in 10 is at risk of birth defects. All of the 17,000 women of child-bearing age prescribed sodium valproate each year in the UK should be on a pregnancy-prevention program to ensure they are aware of the risks. However, campaigners and charities say this is often not the case. In July this year, Baroness Cumberlege announced the findings of her two-year review into three major long-term medical problems, of which sodium valproate was one. She said it was not known how many children had been affected by the drug, but 20,000 was a \"reasonable estimate\". Baroness Cumberlege said babies were still being born today - estimates suggest hundreds a year - who had been exposed to sodium valproate despite the risk being well recognized and undisputed. She said the system did not know how to ensure every woman of childbearing age on the drug was continuously monitored and advised of the risks. In her report, she called for the establishment of a database of all women of childbearing age who were taking the drug, to enable women to be contacted and reminded of the risk. Baroness Cumberlege told BBC Scotland: \"If a woman of childbearing age is taking sodium valproate, she should be given","436":"The article describes an accident that occurred on the A9, north of Aviemore, involving a Blythswood Care truck.

Brazil is about to auction off the rights to develop the site, with some pretty tight strings attached. Magda Chambriard is the Director General of Brazil's National Oil Agency. For her it's a win-win situation. Everything is very well planned. There are new platforms, new pipelines, more infrastructure. Everything here in Brazil is happening in the correct way so we are very confident that everything will be OK.

But experts said that smoking carried much greater cancer risks than alcohol, for most drinkers. And the only way to cut the risks from smoking was to quit completely.\n\nAccording to the guidelines on alcohol consumption, men and women should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week - the equivalent of six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine (or a bottle and a half of wine). The guidance also says there is no \"safe\" level of drinking when it comes to health risk.\n\nThis study says even moderate drinking can put people at risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in women in the UK. What are the cancer harms of alcohol? Writing in BMC Public Health, the researchers calculated that if 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lives.\n\nIn women, alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and in men, it was linked to cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. For their calculations, the research team from the University of Southampton and Bangor University, used data on cancer risk from Cancer Research UK and data on the number of cancers in the population that could be linked to tobacco and alcohol.\n\nDr Minouk Schoemaker, scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, who conducts research into the causes of breast cancer, said the study offered an \"interesting insight\" but the picture was not simple. \"The overall picture of cancer risk is enormously complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions,\" she said. \"For example, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol and cigarette smoking entirely, and the study did not take into account the duration of smoking or time since stopping.\"\n\nThe study only looked at non-smokers, which meant it was not possible to determine how the risks of alcohol and smoking compared.\n\nOther experts questioned the reliability of the data used in the study. Professor Linda Bauld, a cancer expert at the University of Edinburgh, said the estimates were \"impressive\" but that","442":"(You can use your own words as long as you don't copy the article.)\n\nThe article is about Owain Arwel Hughes who has taken control of the event after Cardiff council withdrew its financial support. But he warned that only private sponsorship can safeguard its long-term future. The council said it would still provide the venue, staff and marketing \"in the severest of financial climates\". The local authority always helped to underwrite the cost of staging the annual series of classical concerts, now in its 30th year. Mr Hughes, who has been behind the event since 1986, was forced to personally plug the gap himself for most of the concerts last year. He will continue to have use of St David's Hall but council funding has run out completely for the next series of concerts in July. He has managed to secure sponsors for the anniversary season - one of them is the University of Wales Trinity St David - but doubts remain about the long term.\n\nThe council spokesman said St David's Hall was also hosting the Tiddly Prom with the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra and presenting the Family Prom as part of the Welsh Proms celebrations.\n\n\"Working in partnership with a prestigious musical figure such as Owain Arwel Hughes to preserve this vitally important cultural event shows what can be achieved when all public services are under such enormous pressure,\" he added.","443":"Del Crookes\n\n- The 2012 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world has been announced.\n- Adele, 23, made the list for the first time after a hugely successful year.\n- Pippa Middleton is also making it onto the list for the first time.\n- Claire Danes, Viola Davis, Jessica Chastain, and Tilda Swinton are among the celebrities.\n- The list includes world leaders such as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n- The list is broken into moguls, breakouts, icons, pioneers, and leaders.\n- This year, Time chose 38 women for the list, more than any previous year.\n- Americans still dominate the list but there are 54 international names.\n- The rogues are North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, and Sheik Moktar Ali Zubeyr.\n- Time managing editor Rick Stengel said the list was about the infinite possibilities of influence and the power of influence to change the world.","444":"The article talks about the assassination of Vijaya Kumaratunga, a politician, who was killed by a gunman in front of his residence on 16 February 1988. His wife, Mrs. Kumaratunga, who is the current president of Sri Lanka, believes that there is no military solution for the conflict and that the best tribute for her husband is to help finding a lasting political solution based on devolution of power. In the early eighties, together with his wife, he visited Chennai to meet Tamil militant leaders including LTTE Supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran who was staying in Tamil Nadu at the time. Sinhala nationalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), that opposed any devolution of power and was very critical of Mr. Kumaratunga's policies, is accused of killing the popular politician. Mrs. Kumaratunga formed a government with the JVP in 2004 after sacking the United National Party (UNP) government that signed a wide ranging truce with the Tamil Tigers. Her decision to sack Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe\u2019s government was widely regarded by the analysts as a step backward for the peace process.\n\nMrs. Kumaratunga came to power in 1994 promising peace and development. There was a period of ceasefire since she came to power. Her attempts to amend Sri Lankan constitution introducing devolution of power were made fruitless as the amendment was rejected by the UNP in 1995. 'War for peace' Two main Sinhala political parties argued over technalities leading once again the country to the full scale of war. The first woman executive president of Sri Lanka is accused of continuing with the war instead of actively trying to find a political solution during her 11-year rule. \"War was thrusted upon us by the Tamil Tigers, and then I had no alternative,\" she told BBC Sinhala.com. \"We however, regularly made efforts to find a political solution while fighting the war.\"\n\nThe article discusses the assassination of Vijaya Kumaratunga, a politician, and the attempts to amend Sri Lankan constitution introducing devolution of power.

The cause of the infection was found to be a non-public room with machinery. A 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman also died from the same infection. The health board carried out a clean up at the Vale of Leven Hospital over the Easter weekend and took measures to prevent further incidents. The pigeons were found to be roosting inside a waiting room, which was out of use at the time. The health board said that staff cleaned the area using recommended products and equipment and consulted with pest control experts to seek other methods of control. The first minister was asked about the issue and she said that lessons would be learned.

But a Wiltshire force spokesman said it was thought a number of cases in the county did not get reported, making it harder to tackle the problem. Det Sgt Jackie Barstow said victims may be put off due to misconceptions about how they would be dealt with. Det Sgt Barstow, who is Wiltshire's rape and serious sexual offence co-ordinator, said: \"We have obviously reviewed our processes over the years, we have specially trained officers to deal with victims, and we also work closely with our partner agencies to help support people through that process. \"We would encourage all victims of rape and sexual assault to come to the police and report it to us or to a trusted friend, GP, the hospital services or the sexual assault referral centre in Swindon which covers anybody in Wiltshire as well.\"","448":"The mechanism, which had been in place since the start of this year, suspends trading on China's main stock markets if stocks fall 7%. That circuit-breaker was activated twice this week alone. On Thursday, it was triggered within half an hour of trading. That gave China's stock markets their shortest trading day in 25 years. \"After weighing advantages and disadvantages, currently the negative effect is bigger than the positive one. Therefore, in order to maintain market stability, CSRC has decided to suspend the circuit-breaker mechanism,\" a statement from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said. The renewed share suspension in China caused global shares to fall sharply on Thursday, with Wall Street opening more than 1% lower and European markets trading 2% down. Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Meddling in markets can only lead to misery - at least, that's certainly what many in China's financial circles may now be thinking. The circuit-breakers were designed to \"protect investors and calm markets\", according to regulators, but they have had the opposite effect. Analysts have criticised Chinese authorities for not being clear enough in their communication to the market, and for being too heavy-handed in their attempts to control share prices. This move may well rattle the confidence of investors even further. Watch out for more volatility on Friday. Read more from Karishma here Why China share turmoil affects the world China turmoil set to continue Investors are nervous after the Chinese central bank moved to weaken the the country's currency, the yuan, for the eighth day running, sparking fears of a currency war. This move is designed to boost exports by making Chinese goods cheaper outside the country, analysts have speculated. It is also being interpreted as an indication that consumer demand in China may be slowing more sharply than feared. Official economic growth in China is still running at just below 7%. But moves to depreciate the yuan are indicative of concern about the health of the economy. China's currency has fallen by 2.2% against the US dollar this year. This has led to speculation that China is using it as a weapon in a currency war, where countries deliberately devalue their currencies to boost exports.

He was initially challenged by British Transport Police (BTP) officers for his behavior and became abusive towards them. He proceeded to punch both officers, knocking one of them to the ground and dragging the other in front of a bus. He then punched another officer from Nottinghamshire Police, despite being tasered. Nelson then attacked a police dog, kicking it several times and repeatedly striking it to the head with a plank of wood with a nail in it. This caused the dog to knock him to the ground and he was arrested. The male BTP officer suffered ligament damage to his jaw and thumb, and bruising and swelling across his body. His female colleague had severe concussion and bruising to her face. Nelson pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to two counts of assault, two counts of actual bodily harm, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of a knife, and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. In court, Judge Gregory Dickinson told Nelson that his actions had put further strain on the NHS and police. He emphasized that \"every one of us, every member of the community, has a part to play\" in tackling the COVID-19 epidemic. The court heard that Nelson was visiting a sick friend in Nottingham and became frustrated because he did not understand how he could get home without getting a train. His barrister argued that Nelson had been under stress due to the pandemic and the lockdown measures in place. In response, Judge Dickinson stated that Nelson had demonstrated a \"complete lack of care\" for the safety of the officers and the dog.

The tribe has grown tired of being caught in the middle of confrontations between the army and members of the Farc, Colombia's largest rebel group. The army has moved its men temporarily to avoid further clashes, and General Alejandro Navas has confirmed that the soldiers are still on the mountain where they were based, but have moved further down its slope. Local media have described how some 1,000 Nasa surrounded the army post and grabbed one of the soldiers, carrying him 10m (35 feet) down the mountain. A soldier fired into the air to disperse the Nasa, who in turn threw soil at the armed forces. The Nasa say 250 of them will stay on the top of the mountain to prevent the soldiers from returning. Tension between the security forces and the indigenous groups around Toribio, in Cauca province, have been growing for the past week. After days of attacks by Farc rebels on the police station in Toribio, the Nasa demanded the security forces and the rebels take their fight elsewhere. They dismantled trenches erected by the security forces. They also marched on a rebel camp in the mountains and told the Farc to leave. Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon has warned that the security forces would stay in the area and continue fighting the Farc. He has said that the government would continue dealing with the indigenous population through \"dialogue and respect\", but warned them not to break the law. The steep mountainous area is a Farc stronghold and a key corridor for the trafficking of cocaine. Indigenous groups say they are bearing the brunt of the fighting between the government forces and the rebels. They say the presence of the security forces attracts the rebels, whose mortars often miss their intended targets and kill civilians. They want to assume control of the area and guard it themselves.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com October 25, 2018, 7:43 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/business\/international-business\/nasa-tribe-gives-security-forces-overnight-deadline-leave-73116","458":"The Hollywood Reporter claims that Warner Brothers is in talks with director Todd Phillips to return for the second film. It also suggests he will direct other movies based on famous DC villains. Actor Joaquin Phoenix and writer Scott Silver are also expected to return for Joker 2. The most profitable comic book movie of all time Earlier his month, Joker became the most profitable comic book movie of all time, when it was revealed it has earned $950 million (\u00a3738m) at the worldwide box office. Joker has made more than 15 times what it cost to make, reports Forbes. Director Todd Phillips made the movie on a budget of $62.5m (\u00a349m), a fraction of the budget of many comic book adaptations. Avengers: Endgame, the highest grossing movie of all time, has earned close to $2.8 billion (\u00a32.2bn) but had a budget of $356 million (\u00a3276m). Endgame has made more at the box office overall, but Joker has made more in relation to what was spent to make it. 'The intellectual comic book movie'? Joker has even been tipped for nominations at 2020's Oscars. \"I think it's presented itself as the intellectual comic book movie - and people have bought that,\" film journalist Helen O'Hara tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"Comic book fans are going to see it because it's a comic book movie, but it's also marketed as a comic book movie for people who are too cool for comic book movies.\" Joker's box office success means it's more profitable than Tom Hardy's Venom movie, which made $854m (\u00a3663m) on a $90m (\u00a370m) budget - and Ryan Reynold's Deadpool which returned $783m (\u00a3608m) on a $58m (\u00a345m) budget. It has also out-performed older movies such as Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Mask - which was previously the most profitable comic book movie.

The hotel has been used as accommodation for homeless people since 1988. In January, Pierfront Properties applied to convert it into 14 flats and to replace a coach house with five houses. The majority of objections to the plans were from people living in the building, including Edward Hyde who told BCP it would exacerbate the homeless situation and put the welfare of residents at risk. Another occupant, Christopher Whitely, told the council he and others in the building had been issued eviction notices for 27 September, and added: \"All residents are in complete limbo for their futures.\" You may also be interested in: Karen Hunt, who oversaw the homeless accommodation, had urged Pierfront to withdraw the plans, saying the lives of people living there had been transformed.

Riots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August and spread to other English cities including Birmingham, Liverpool, Nottingham and Manchester. The study was funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). The JISC is an education and research body paid for by higher education funding councils. The committee included experts from a range of disciplines from the universities of Manchester, Leicester, St Andrews and Wolverhampton, and University College London. Rioting in Tottenham began two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest quickly spread to other parts of the capital and other English cities. 'Valuable tool' The study looked at 2.4 million tweets sent during the disturbances and found \"no evidence\" to back calls that Twitter should be closed down for inciting unrest. Prof Rob Procter from the University of Manchester, who led the team, said: \"In August this year social unrest spilled over on to the streets of English cities and the summer riots were the largest public disorder events in recent history. \"Politicians and commentators were quick to claim that social media played an important role in inciting and organising riots, calling for sites such as Twitter to be closed should events of this nature happen again. \"But our study found no evidence of significance in the available data that would justify such a course of action in respect to Twitter. \"In contrast, we do find strong evidence that Twitter was a valuable tool for mobilising support for the post-riot clean-up and for organising specific clean-up activities,\" he added. Researchers analysed the millions of tweets generated during and after the riots by using experts in cloud computing from the University of St Andrews.

A reluctance to admit mistakes, poor record-keeping and misplaced loyalty were among poor practices, but no laws were breached, the EHRC found. The Met said it was working \"to tackle the perceptions of victimisation\". In total 68 employment tribunal claims were brought against the Met last year, of which it lost three. Complicating factors identified by the commission in its study were a police culture of \"looking after your own\", and the force's \"painful history\" over racism. The EHRC launched its investigation in the wake of the Carol Howard case. The Met came under heavy criticism over the way the firearms officer was treated after it was revealed she had been arrested over disagreements with her estranged partner. No charges were ever brought and an employment tribunal heard she was hounded by her boss for being a black woman. In another case, PC Daniel Lichters was taunted for being gay, and a tribunal said the Met had \"either set out to, or were reckless about destroying the claimant's character\". Laura Carstensen, lead EHRC commissioner for the investigation, said: \"It is unacceptable that police officers and staff often expect to be victimised if they complain about discrimination, and particularly so when this is the organisation to which all Londoners look for protection and fair treatment.\" The commission said it was unable to decide whether officers actually suffered after making a complaint, because \"the quality of the [police's] data... made it difficult to reach any conclusions\". Former Supt Leroy Logan, a founder member of the National Black Police Association, said during his 30-year career there was a sense that if you complained \"you'd betrayed the organisation or showed a sign of weakness\". He said a zero tolerance stance was needed and recruitment, retention and progression needed to be monitored and evidenced to address a","469":"The article discusses the transformation of Facebook from a tech company to a media company.

Newsbeat's been getting some practical advice to help you out. Prioritise exploring over applying Lots of companies have been using the government's furlough scheme to pay staff wages. It means the number of people out of work hasn't risen as predicted, but this will change once the scheme comes to an end this autumn. If you're going to be looking for a new role in the next six to 12 months, it's likely there will be lots of other people looking for jobs at the same time. Helen Tupper, who co-founded career development company Amazing If says it's a great time to get curious about your career. \"Look at lots of different roles, look at what's interesting, ask people what they actually do in an average day, find out the detail of those roles,\" she says. This is preferable, Helen says, to just applying for something because the job title look good. Be clear You might be creative, organised and sociable, but what does that actually mean in the context of the job you're applying for? \"If you're going to try to stand out, what you really want to do is make sure your strengths have a clear value to your employer,\" Helen tells Newsbeat. Celebrate your successes - however small Applying for jobs can be gruelling, especially if it feels like you keep getting knocked back.

In her paper, Prof Sweeney suggested that Google searches may expose \"racial bias in society\". Google has said it \"does not conduct any racial profiling\". In a statement to the BBC, the company said: \"We also have an 'anti' and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation, person or group of people.\" When placing ads with Google, companies are able to specify which keywords they would like to target. \"It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads,\" the search giant said. Arrested? The study analysed the type of advertisements that appeared on Google when certain names were searched for. It looked at Google.com's core search engine, as well as the search function of Reuters.com - which also displays Google's advertising. Prof Sweeney's investigation suggests that names linked with black people - as defined by a previous study into racial discrimination in the workplace - were 25% more likely to have results that prompted the searcher to click on a link to search criminal record history. She found that names like Leroy, Kareem and Keisha would yield advertisements that read \"Arrested?\", with a link to a website which could perform criminal record checks. Searches for names such as Brad, Luke and Katie would not - instead more likely to offer websites that can provide general contact details. \"There is discrimination in the delivery of these ads,\" concluded Prof Sweeney, adding that there was a less than 1% chance that the findings could be based on chance. \"Alongside news stories about high school athletes and children can be ads bearing the child's name and suggesting arrest. This seems concerning on many levels.\" User habits However, she was reluctant to pinpoint a cause for the discrepancies, saying that to do so requires more data and analysis. \"One possibility is that users who searched for particular names were different,\" Prof Sweeney told the BBC. \"For example, when looking at Google.com, searches for 'Kareem' were most likely to be in Chicago, New York or Los Angeles. Searches for 'Brad' were most likely to be in Chicago, New York or Boston.\" But she stressed that even with these","474":"The Department for Transport (DfT) held a meeting with the managers of Southern, Thameslink and Network Rail.

Mrs Hewitt said GPs told her: \"You're too young for anything like cancer.\" The mother of two, from Hereford, had surgery to remove the tumor in April and is urging people to get symptoms checked.\n\nMore than 2,500 people under 50 are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every year, according to charity Bowel Cancer UK. After noticing blood in her stools in the summer of 2018, Mrs Hewitt was first prescribed cream for haemorrhoids. \"It was persistent, it would stop for about a week and then after a week it would carry on again,\" she said. Despite having no other symptoms associated with bowel cancer, as time passed the occupational therapist became worried the blood was an indicator of something more serious. \"I think I went back to (my GP) about five or six times... they were just saying, 'no you're too young for anything like cancer',\" said Mrs Hewitt. \"I'd think 'they're going to think I'm a bit mad because I'm worrying about nothing',\" she added. After securing a private referral, Mrs Hewitt had a colonoscopy and scans to confirm the diagnosis, something she described as \"a relief.\" About 18cm (7in) of her bowel was removed during surgery and further investigations revealed no further treatment was required, she said.

The 61-year-old, who has a family history of prostate cancer, had an MRI scan in March which revealed a two-centimetre lesion on his prostate that he said he was told \"may be a high-grade tumour\". He said he was told he needed an urgent biopsy to find out, but since the coronavirus pandemic, has been told he will be contacted in four months. \"I could be dead in four months,\" Mr Durcan said.

Dr Morley said he had been informed of cases where a GP had thought a patient needed urgent assessment and these \"weren't dealt with in the right timescale or indeed haven't been dealt with at all\". In a statement, the trust said that during the first phase of the pandemic staff \"had to manage elective referrals in a severely modified way due to resource constraints\".

The Moroccan's phone showed that he had watched a jihadist video shortly before launching the attack, Mr Molins added. Prosecutors have now filed formal charges against him. Mr Khazzani is accused of carrying out a \"targeted and premeditated\" jihadist attack. He is also accused of firearms offences and \"participation in a terrorist association with a view to organising one or several damaging crimes,\" according to prosecutors' documents quoted by the AFP news agency. He was overpowered by passengers on the Thalys express train from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday. No-one died. Three Americans and one Briton who overpowered the gunman were awarded medals for their bravery. A US-born Frenchman, Mark Magoolian, and another unnamed Frenchman will also be given awards later for trying to tackle the gunman.

He said a formal terrorism investigation had been opened, adding that other European authorities had passed on information about the suspect's travels and links to radical Islam. Mr Molins said Mr Khazzani was \"known for his radicalism\" and had recently travelled to Turkey - \"a possible route to Syria\". The suspect is said to have denied plotting a terrorist attack, saying he found a bag of weapons the night before and planned to use them to rob passengers. But the prosecutor said Mr Khazzani's explanation became less and less clear during questioning and eventually he stopped talking to investigators altogether.\n\n### \"Order a similar paper and get 15% discount on your first order with us Use the following coupon \"FIRST15\"\n\nOrder Now","483":"- The Sri Lankan government has consistently maintained that the LTTE must lay down arms and end hostilities.\n- The government\u2019s main focus is to minimize civilian casualties.\n- Health officials from the area are being pressured by the LTTE.\n- The Sri Lankan army has denied claims that they have used poisonous gas against the LTTE.\n- The army has never used chemical weapons against the LTTE, but there have been times when the LTTE has used chemical weapons.\n- Dr. T.

The parents argue that the government is leaving councils in England unable to fulfil their legal duties to give these children the support they need. The judges will decide whether Send funding decisions have been lawful and may order a government rethink. The government said it is investing significantly into high needs budgets. Outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, parents of children with special needs made a series of emotional pleas for the government to listen.

The fight is real, exhausting and mind-blowing,\" she told nodding supporters.\n\nFamilies of children with extra learning needs have long had to fight for support, but campaigners say the situation has become a national crisis. Austerity budgets and changes to the system, in 2014, have meant the huge increase in demand for support has not been matched with an associated rise in funding. In the past financial year, eight out of 10 councils in England spent more than their allocated budgets for high needs, a BBC News investigation found. And school leaders have complained their school budgets are being used to plug gaps in special needs funding.\n\nPart of the issue has been the fact that, in 2014, councils were given the additional responsibility of providing support to children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send), which has put strain on their finances. This has been made worse by the fact that the government did not provide extra money to cover the increased costs.

Clare Milford Haven, a former social editor at Tatler magazine and a polo player, met with me in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station to talk about this most sensitive of subjects. Her eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright, and good-looking. He took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006. He was in his second year of studying Spanish and business. Described by his mother as \"a doer\", he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job. James had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood. 'Horrendous and alarming' Clare Milford Haven told me: \"I wish I'd kept him under my watchful eye. \"I couldn't force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life. \"It was the most horrendous and alarming experience. \"There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn't see it coming.

The seabed alongside Hinkley Point C - which is being built near Bridgwater - is being dredged so that the \u00a321.5-22.5bn power station's water cooling system can be installed. EDF Energy says this will be a \"significant piece of infrastructure\", involving tunnelling more than 3km into the Bristol Channel.

The woman had approached the police for support, and the officer took advantage of her vulnerability. The officer's actions undoubtedly eroded the woman's trust in the police, and the force has acknowledged the seriousness of the matter. The officer was suspended in 2018, and an Independent Office for Police Conduct investigation concluded in 2019 that he had a case to answer for gross misconduct. The force has also sacked another officer in 2019 for having a sexual relationship with a domestic abuse survivor. The IOPC has said that the officer failed to show sufficient regard for the professional boundaries he must observe in his role as an officer and failed to fulfil his public duty by carrying out investigations into the crimes reported.

The announcement of 300 jobs is the largest that the Northern Ireland executive has been able to unveil in ten months, and it continues Belfast's track record of attracting well-paid jobs in the financial services sector. However, there is currently a disagreement between the DUP and Sinn Fein over what a Brexit future holds for the local economy, and the announcement of these jobs does not change that fact.

The government said placements \"should meet the needs of children\". Stockport MP Ms Coffey - chair of the all party parliamentary group for runaway and missing children and adults - said there had been a 64% rise nationally in the number of children being sent to live away between 2012 and 2017. Figures obtained by Ms Coffey from the Department for Education show the number of children placed in homes out of their borough has risen from 2,250 in 2012 to 3,680 in March 2017. 'Physical abuse' Ms Coffey said some children were being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live \"where they have no friends or family circles or local social workers\", creating a \"perfect storm where it is increasingly difficult to protect [them]\". \"Despite the [government] pledge, record numbers of children are being sent away to places where they are more vulnerable to exploitation,\" she added. \"These children are running away at a faster rate and are being targeted and preyed upon by paedophiles and criminals who know they are vulnerable.\" The MP said there had also been a huge increase in the number of sent-away children going missing, with the number of incidents more than doubling to almost 10,000 a year.

Cymdeithas yr Iaith said the council's plans were based on \"tired\" arguments. The council said it wanted high standards and denied it was in a hurry. A report being considered by the committee on Monday highlights the cost per pupil and a backlog of maintenance at all three schools. It also references lower than expected standards at Ysgol Henblas and Ysgol Bodffordd. The report recommends either building a new school to replace all three or building a school to replace Ysgol Bodffordd and Ysgol Corn Hir and maintaining Ysgol Henblas either in its current form or as a multi-site school. The committee will consider the options and make a recommendation on the future of the schools. However, the Welsh language group pointed to changes to the School Organisation Code that will mean rural schools will be officially designated and listed, making closures the last resort. Authorities will have to assess the likely impact of a school's closure on children's education, the wider community and travel arrangements, and explain why closure is the \"most appropriate\" course of action.

The Beecroft report suggested \"some people will be dismissed simply because their employer doesn't like them\" but that was a \"price worth paying\", Mr Miliband told MPs. He asked Mr Cameron: \"Are you really telling us that, with record numbers out of work, sacking people for no good reason is a price worth paying?\" Mr Cameron said unemployment was falling, inflation was coming down and the government had cut the deficit by 25%. 'Supporting business' He told the Labour leader: \"We are taking all of these steps which have led to the greatest number of small business start-ups last year in the country's history. \"Of course, you cannot support any changes to employment regulation because you are in the pocket of the trade unions.\" The prime minister said the Beecroft report contained excellent ideas but the government was consulting on the idea of no-fault dismissal only for \"micro-businesses\".

The Conservative donor told the Daily Telegraph Mr Cable's objections to his suggestions, published in a report this week, were \"ideological not economic\" and he accused Mr Cable of being a \"socialist\" who had done very little to support business.

The 31-year-old's temperature was 40.4C (104.7F) - well above a normal 37C. He was one of three reservists to die from overheating on the 16-mile (26km) march on a \"boiling hot\" day. Cpl Dunsby, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital 17 days later. L\/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county, died at the scene and L\/Cpl Edward Maher died about three hours later at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil. The hearing has previously been told the exercise took place on one of the hottest days of the year, with temperatures expected to hit 27C (80.6F). In a statement on the seventh day of the hearing, Welsh Ambulance clinical team leader Damon James said he did not think L\/Cpl Dunsby would survive.

Mr James said: \"He told me the male (Cpl Dunsby) had been on a four-day exercise and was half-an-hour from the finish. \"He said the male had collapsed about 100 yards up the track. He said they had carried plenty of water but were pushing themselves to the limit.\" The hearing in the Solihull, West Midlands, was also told an unnamed walker was earlier asked by an Army officer to fan down Cpl Dunsby, hold his head and watch his breathing while four other soldiers carried him on a stretcher from the hillside.

The company's chief executive said the jobs would be created as part of a five to six-year expansion plan. The money will be used to build a second factory and car assembly line at the site for a new car range. Dany Bahar, Group Lotus chief executive, said he was \"very, very delighted\" with the news. He said: \"It was always our intention from the beginning to create jobs in the region, especially in the automotive manufacturing industry in the UK, which was an issue. \"I believe it took a bit of time for the government to understand our plans going forward and the desire to keep the production for such a small car company together. \"It would not have made too much sense to have the mid-engined cars produced here at Hethel and different engined cars somewhere else.\" 'Complete remake' Mr Bahar added that that despite the worldwide economic problems, he believed there was still a strong market for sportcars and that would continue. Last year, Lotus unveiled five new cars at the Paris motor show, in what Mr Bahar hailed a \"complete remake of the brand\". With the government funding confirmed, the company said it would expect to see its first new car roll off the production line by 2013.

The family of Sinclair Upton, who was buried there in 1957, have consented to their plot being excavated. For relatives of Alexander Gartshore, the search may confirm whether the child rapist committed another heinous crime. Moira's tortured family have not known what happened to her since she left her family home in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957. The 11-year-old, who was five weeks short of her 12th birthday, was running an errand for her family to a nearby Co-op store when she vanished during a blizzard. She was last seen on board a bus driven by Gartshore, who was jailed later that year for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. Despite decades of appeals, the schoolgirl was never traced. The case remained cold until 1999, when child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as the murderer. Gallogley was said to have made the confession to another inmate while he was dying in Peterhead Prison. Father accused After Gartshore's death in 2006, his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira, published a book in which she accused her late father of the schoolgirl's murder. She said she believed Gartshore had initially buried the child's body in a ditch but later moved it to an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery. Mrs Brown, who later received an OBE for services to child protection and set up the Moira Anderson Foundation, believes her friend's body lies in the burial plot of Sinclair Upton, a former acquaintance of Gartshore. The paedophile is later said to have remarked that Mr Sinclair \"done him a favour\". In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot found anomalies in the soil that would be consistent with another body being buried there. Mrs Brown and Moira's sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, then launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed.

Neil Watt and Kris Reid spent most of 2020 in Castle Ward, the famed 18th Century mansion in County Down. With no visitors allowed for most of the year, they set to work meticulously restoring some of the manor's interior and historic collections. Neil, the newly-appointed collections and house manager, moved into the top floor of the mansion in March and was preparing to welcome thousands to the National Trust property when coronavirus hit. With both men experienced conservationists - Neil has a PhD in Irish country houses and Kris is studying for a PhD in heritage - they instead set about giving everything from the chandeliers to the kitchen utensils a new lease of life. First there was the installation of a new dehumidifying system to address a centuries-old damp problem. Then they set about cleaning and cataloguing the house's collection of 2,000 books, most dating from the 18th Century. Castle Ward also boasts one of the finest sets of cooking pots and pans on the island of Ireland, but over the centuries it had become blackened and tarnished. The couple polished the 100 pieces one by one. They did the same with many other fixtures and fittings, including all the brass door handles. The good weather in the early summer allowed them to clean the antique window blinds and beat down the luxury carpets and rugs. There was also the delicate job of cleaning the crystal Victorian chandeliers.

She said Hope had been \"overwhelmed\" by the support she had received so far. In its first 24 hours, the fundraiser received \u00a355,000 in donations. It has since reached \u00a391,793 and Miss Stringer said any excess funds would be given to Sarcoma UK. The funds have come from more than 1,000 supporters, with donations ranging from \u00a35 to \u00a35,000. Hope wrote a blog about her experience when she learned she had cancer in 2014. In the blog she described how she \"looked like Uncle Fester's love child\" while going through chemotherapy. She was originally treated by the NHS, but her sister said this time it was unable to offer a cure and could only put her through chemotherapy again.

Hu Jintao was the Communist Party leader in Tibet in 1988-1992, when Chinese troops quelled mass protests. China imposed martial law in Tibet. The remote mountainous territory is an autonomous region ruled by Beijing. In their lawsuit against Hu Jintao the Madrid-based Tibetan Support Committee allege that as Communist leader in the region he was ultimately responsible for actions \"aimed at eliminating the uniqueness and existence of Tibet as a country, imposing martial law, carrying out forced deportations, mass sterilisation campaigns, torture of dissidents\". The Spanish legal system recognises the universal justice principle, under which genocide suspects can be put on trial outside their home country. But for Spain to hold the trial there is a requirement that at least one victim of alleged genocide must be a Spanish citizen. Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over Tibet, but many Tibetans remain loyal to the exiled Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. He is seen by his followers as a living god, but by China as a separatist threat.

Rex Tillerson disclosed the development on Saturday, saying North Korea had little interest in dialogue. The two countries have engaged in heated rhetoric in recent months. The US wants North Korea to halt its weapons programme, which has seen it perform repeated missile tests, as well as claim to have successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb which could be loaded on to a long-range missile. But attempts at dialogue seem to be at odds with President Trump's own attitude to the issue. On Sunday, he tweeted, in reference to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un: \"I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...\" He then added: He did not elaborate on what he means by \"we'll do what has to be done\". However a senior US official, asked for clarification later, told Reuters: \"At a time when North Korea is continuing its provocations, the president does not think now is the time to negotiate with them.\" The official also said the diplomatic channels were mainly used to discuss American citizens detained by Pyongyang.

A representative of campaign group Amnesty International questioned the validity of the allegations against Li. The lawyer was detained in 2015 as part of a wider government crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping. His trial took place on Tuesday in the Tianjin City Number Two Intermediate People's Court and concerned state secrets, the court said on its Weibo social media account. 'Smear and attack' In its ruling, the court said that since 2008 Li had used social media and foreign media to \"smear and attack state organs and the legal system\". It also said he had used foreign funds to \"interfere in high-profile cases\" and colluded with several people \"harbouring subversive ideas\", including lawyers and those \"involved in illegal religious activities\". His jail sentence had been suspended for four years and he would be denied his political privileges, the court said. The suspension means Li could be released imminently, although it is unclear whether he has been. His time spent in detention should also count towards his jail sentence.

They hope to launch the new Funeral Expense Assistance benefit by the summer of 2019. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said she was taking \"decisive action\" over what was a \"growing issue\". The cost of burials and cremations has been on the rise, studies have shown. In 2016 a basic burial, on average, cost more than \u00a31,300, excluding undertakers fees, while the average local authority cremation cost \u00a3670. A 2016 study by the Stirling Citizens Advice bureau found there had been a steep rise in so-called \"paupers' funerals\", which cost local authorities \u00a3500,000 in the previous year. The new benefit is part of a 10-point plan which commits the government to a range of actions over funeral costs. It includes a range of advice services, including guidance on funeral costs, consumer protection in relation to funeral plans, a Social Innovation Fund to tackle funeral poverty and the pilot of a \"funeral bond\" to help people save up for their own burial. 'Increased difficulties' Ms Constance said the government was committed to \"supporting those who need it most following a bereavement\".

On Monday it was announced new coronavirus cases had been identified in four Jersey schools, while pupils at several others had been asked to learn from home due to staff shortages. 'Legal responsibilities' Senator Vallois said senior advisers were \"working closely\" with head teachers to monitor health and safety in schools. She said: \"The STAC [Scientific and Technical Advisory Cell] advice has been clear, in terms of the limited effectiveness of curtailing the spread of the virus by closing schools, and the increasing evidence of harm by keeping children out of school for longer periods.\" The NASUWT has called on the government \"to move immediately to blended learning\" and for greater safety protections to be \"urgently put in place\". In a statement it said: \"Given the surge in cases of Covid in Jersey, the NASUWT believes the government is currently failing to adequately meet its responsibilities to keep staff and pupils safe in schools.\" General secretary Patrick Roach added: \"Ministers must pull their heads from the sand and take action, rather than the constant dithering and delay that is causing more harm with every passing minute. \"The NASUWT will be putting the Jersey Government on notice of their legal responsibilities in respect of the health and safety of our members and will not hesitate to take further action if there is evidence that the welfare of members is being compromised.\"\n\nSummary:","24":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

They want to develop the site in Blackbird Leys, which has not been used for greyhound racing since 2012. Campaigners want to save the stadium from development and use it for sport. 'Massive boost' City council leader Bob Price said he was \"very pleased\" with the High Court decision. \"The court found that the designation process had been carried out in a thorough and exemplary manner which met all the statutory requirements,\" he said. The BBC has contacted GRA for comment. Oxford East MP Andrew Smith said the decision was a \"massive boost\" for the campaign to save the stadium. \"I think the developers now really have got to face facts and listen to local people and allow the stadium to be used for recreation, get back greyhound racing, speedway and invest in what should be a first rate facility for our whole community,\" he said. The track, which was also home to speedway, closed in December 2012 after the GRA said it was no longer viable. In January last year city council planners refused proposals from developer Galliard to demolish the stadium and build 220 homes on the site. The developer withdrew its appeal against the decision in May after the site was listed as a conservation area.

The government says \"non-viable\" Remploy factories should close and the money be invested into other schemes. The London protest was the latest in a series across the country. Remploy workers are employed in enterprises that vary from furniture and packaging manufacturing to recycling electrical appliances and operating CCTV systems and control rooms. Among the protesters who travelled to central London for the demonstration were factory workers from Spennymoor in County Durham and Barrow and Cleator Moor in Cumbria. After a protest outside the Department for Work and Pensions, the group moved to Parliament where members held a meeting chaired by Labour MP for Wansbeck Ian Lavery. 'Outrageous' decision Phil Davies, national secretary of the GMB union, said: \"This lobby of Parliament and the demonstrations around the country are a measure of the massive public support for continued funding of the Remploy factories.\" A report by Liz Sayce, chief executive of Disability Rights UK, into the way in which the government spends its disability employment budget recommended government funding should focus on support for individuals, rather than subsidising factory businesses. She recommended the cash should be diverted into the Access to Work fund, which provides technology and other help to firms for the disabled, whose average spend per person is \u00a32,900. The Department for Work and Pensions said about a fifth of that budget was currently spent on Remploy factories, but added that almost all of the factories were loss-making and last year lost \u00a368.3m. But Mr Davies said it was \"outrageous\" that the government could take away the jobs of disabled workers.

In fact this latest news allows Brazilians a moment of indulgence despite what was actually a year of quite sluggish growth. In 2011, the country's economy grew by 2.7%, a big drop from the 7.5% growth seen the previous year. Despite its good fortune, Brazil has not entirely escaped the impact of the financial crisis. However, even with the lower-than-expected result, the old tag of \"country of the future - and always will be\" is starting to sound less of a joke and more like a promise being fulfilled. In the last 10 years, Brazil consolidated its role as an agricultural superpower, discovered massive oil reserves in the Atlantic, paid its debts to the International Monetary Fund and developed a more assertive diplomacy. With a newly-found confidence, it started to break through the stereotypical image when it was often seen by others as only being the land of football and samba. It also saw the rise of a new middle class, whose purchasing power has been fuelling Brazil's continuous economic growth amid declining industrial output and weak global economic activity. A combination of economic success and government measures to distribute income has helped lift millions out of poverty, although Brazil remains a very unequal country. Low unemployment combined with wage increases and a boom in credit has helped to fuel this consumption. The recent growth in the number of shopping centres provides the clearest illustration of this trend. In 2011, 22 new shopping centres were opened, bringing the total number across the country to 430. A further 74 are planned for this year and next.

Its founder Kelly Morellon worked with her mother Sylvie to devise a design that covers the nose but makes the mouth visible, and can be washed at a high temperature to reduce infection. \"The basic aim of these transparent masks is to allow deaf and hearing impaired people to read the lips of someone speaking to them,\" Kelly told the BBC. \"But they are also very useful for autistic people, people with learning difficulties and small children who might be scared of masks or need to be able to see facial expressions. \"In any case, a transparent mask allows you to see each other's smiles, and at this sad time this could not be more important.\" Unlike some companies around the world - in Scotland, the US and Indonesia, for instance - Kelly and her mother are not able to produce their masks on a commercial basis.

In a message, director Morten Tyldum said it was \"an amazing honour\" to win the prize. \"For film fans to support the Imitation Game means so much to me, the entire cast and film-making team,\" he said. Turing was credited with bringing about the end of the war and saving hundreds of thousands of lives after decoding German Naval messages. He is also considered to be the founding father of the modern-day computer. However his later life was overshadowed after a conviction in 1952 for gross indecency when homosexuality was illegal in Britain. He was chemically castrated and committed suicide in 1954. Earlier this week Tyldum described the film as \"a tribute to being different\". Winners of the People's Choice award - voted for by the public - have previously gone on to win the Oscar for best picture, including The King's Speech, Slumdog Millionaire and last year's 12 Years a Slave. The Imitation Game's victory suggests it may feature prominently in this coming awards' season. Sir Ben Kingsley's romantic comedy Learning to Drive, in which the actor stars as a Sikh taxi driver and driving instructor alongside Patricia Clarkson, was named first runner-up for the top prize. Comedy drama St Vincent, starring Bill Murray as a cantankerous war veteran who finds himself having to look after his neighbour's young son, was the second runner-up. The People's Choice documentary award went to Hajooj Kuka's Beats of the Antonov which follows the story of Sudanese cattle farmers.

A police spokesman said the number of deaths was \"usual\" for the TT period when thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts visit the island from around the world.

At a press conference at 1 am (local time) yesterday after five hours of negotiations, the foreign minister recognised the Philippines' \"positive response\".

No wonder there are many messages on the internet satirising the foreign minister as Basilio's translator,\" Taipei's Apple Daily comments.

Apple Daily and Want Daily also see a geopolitical \"China-US tussle\" behind the dispute. Taipei's Liberty Times also says Manila's close relations with the US are complicating matters.

Arla said the cuts came following a wide review of its cheese business. Vale of Clwyd MP Chris Ruane said he would do \"everything possible\" to ensure a future for the plant, which has been on site for nearly a century. Denbighshire council said it was \"disappointed\" and would be asking to meet representatives from the company as soon as possible. An Arla spokeswoman said the factory would close by the end of the year, with a phased redundancy programme and production would move to other UK sites. Workers were told the news on Tuesday morning and consultations with union representatives were expected to being immediately. One staff member, who has worked at the creamery for 17 years and did not want to be named, said he was \"gutted\" at the news. \"I'm gutted for the area and I'm gutted for myself,\" he said. \"There's been rumours for months, but they (Arla) wouldn't say anything. \"It's not looking good.

The cost to the UK economy has been estimated to be as high as \u00a3770m by police chiefs. The crime particularly affects the rail industry and utility companies. Theft of important sculptures and memorials has also increased dramatically due to the rise in the value of metal. The crime impacts on communities across the country, according to Mr MacAskill. Dedicated team The measures were outlined following the conclusion of the Scottish government's consultation to improve standards in the industry, which is likely to lead to the expansion of the metal dealers' licensing scheme. The results of the consultation will be published shortly. The proposals coincide with the announcement that British Transport Police (BTP) will establish a dedicated team of officers based in the east of the country to target cable and metal thieves as well as unscrupulous scrap metal dealers. Mr MacAskill, who joined BTP during three days of multi-agency activity to target thieves, said: \"The Scottish government takes metal theft extremely seriously and we are tacking tough action to tackle it. \"This is not a victimless crime, the impact is enormous - businesses face repair bills of tens of thousands of pounds, communities lose essential services and there are huge hidden costs to the economy due to delays to major transport routes and business services. \"Thieves may make only a relatively small amount of money, such as \u00a350, from stolen metal and that's why removing the attraction of easy 'ready cash' payments is one way to help stop this scourge.

Market indices have stopped falling so fast (\"too late to sell, too early to buy\" was one investor's observation) and we are now beginning to get a sense of the scale of job losses. The tourist industry was hit very hard with the denial of two big earners as far away as August in the Edinburgh festivals (cancelled) and the COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November (postponed). That underlined the heightened level of exposure for hospitality and tourism, and was a signal of how long this is going to affect the economy. The prospect, of spectator sport potentially not returning until 2021, adds to that sense that it won't be over by Easter, or summer, or long after that. Unemployment surge The most startling numbers were from the USA. One way of measuring unemployment in the States is by the number of people who register each week. In Britain, we don't have data that responds that fast. The US figure the week before last was up by 3.3m, more than four times the previous one-week record. This week, that was up to 6.6m. The closest indicator in the UK is the number of people registering for Universal Credit, up nearly a million in only nine days. A lot of worklessness - that is, having nothing to do - is mitigated by the UK government pouring money into job retention schemes, both for the employed and the self-employed. That may be a much bigger number than the government thought it would be. A lot of employers are turning to that as a means to keep people on their books, and to handle the sudden drying up of cash flow. Furlough for long?

But the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs) are attracting loud noisy opposition in most places they are put in. LTNs use planters to stop through traffic but they also mean getting around in places like Northfields in Ealing by car becomes a lot more difficult. And that is the theory behind them - they want to drive down car ownership and get people to switch to cycling and walking. It is important to state they also get strong support. And with congestion levels almost near pre-lockdown levels and looking to the surpass them, some councils think LTNs are the answer to create low traffic corridors. There is also, I suspect, a silent majority and it is very difficult to gauge what the majority want. Many, I think, are waiting to see how the six-month trials work out. One thing is certain, these schemes have split communities. When you are out filming LTNs it takes minutes before people are telling you about how they hate them. Moments later a family will pass and say: \"Keep the LTNs.\" It is rare for transport schemes to attract that instant response and in Northfields in west London when I was there, that is all everyone was talking about. In the middle are the councils which designed them, funded by money from central government. Crucially for boroughs, there was a set time limit to apply for the funding and controversially the schemes use emergency traffic orders. The consultation happens over the first six months of operation. Some of the planters were put in overnight with no warning. That type of ongoing consultation has angered many. And now local politics seems to be coming into play. If there was ever a quick U-turn, then the Conservative council of Wandsworth did it last week by scrapping their LTNs.

This month the number of female prisoners reached 84, the highest recorded in the past five years. The NI Prison Service said it was using other facilities on the Hydebank Wood site to manage the higher inmate numbers. A spokesperson said: \"It is not unusual for prison populations to fluctuate, which is why NIPS has plans in place to manage this throughout its estate. \"While Ash House has 71 rooms, it is not the only facility for female prisoners at Hydebank Wood. Therefore 'doubling up' is not always necessary but can be accommodated, if necessary, on a voluntary basis.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Justice said it recognised the number of women in custody was a \"significant issue\" and it was committed to \"reducing offending among women\". As well as female prisoners, young male offenders are also held on another part of the site in Hydebank Wood's secure college. In 2017\/18 the average daily population of female prisoners in Northern Ireland was 57. But in recent weeks the number of female prisoners in Hydebank Wood has increased to over 80, peaking at 84 in mid-July. It has since fallen back to 81.

They estimated that around 110,000 people in French Polynesia were affected by the radioactive fallout. The number represented \"almost the entire\" population at the time, the researchers found. French Polynesia, a French territory made up of hundreds of islands and atolls including Tahiti, was the site of dozens of nuclear tests over 30 years. Over the course of two years, researchers analysed around 2,000 documents released by the French military and recreated the impact of \"the most contaminating\" of France's nuclear tests carried out between 1966 and 1974. The study was carried out in collaboration between French news website Disclose, researchers from Princeton University and British firm Interprt. The 41st test took place over Mururoa Atoll on 17 July 1974, when the atomic cloud took a different trajectory than planned. Some 42 hours after the test codenamed Centaur, \"the inhabitants of Tahiti and the surrounding islands of the Windward group were subjected to significant amounts of ionising radiation\", the report says. The area was home to 110,000 people and Tahiti's main city, Papeete, alone had a population of 80,000. According to the investigation, the resulting radiation from the French tests was between two and 10 times higher than estimates given by France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in a 2006 report. One reason, according to the findings, is that the CEA \"did not always take into account the drinking of contaminated rainwater\" when calculating the dose of radiation individuals were likely to have been exposed to. Catherine Serda, who was a child at the time of the tests, told France Inter radio that eight members of her family contracted cancer. \"This is not normal.

Supt Jaki Whittred said it was a \"complex investigation\" and officers remained in the area while the force worked to establish the circumstances which led to the device being found. \"I understand that this is concerning for local residents in Luton but I'd like to reassure you that our officers, EOD specialists, and a number of our partner agencies are working closely together to ensure the safety of the public,\" she said. \"Brook Street and Dunstable Road remain closed as a result of this and I'd like to thank residents and business owners in the vicinity for their patience with this.\" One local shop owner, who wanted to remain anonymous, said he had been ordered not to open his business. \"It's a big shock,\" he said. \"You don't expect to come out in the morning and not open your business.\" Around 50 people were evacuated but were later allowed to go home.

The study, published in the journal Cell, says the diet reboots the body. Experts said the findings were \"potentially very exciting\" as they could become a new treatment for the disease. People are advised not to try this without medical advice. In the experiments, mice were put on a modified form of the \"fasting-mimicking diet\". It is like the human form of the diet when people spend five days on a low-calorie, low-protein, low-carbohydrate but high unsaturated-fat diet. It resembles a vegan diet with nuts and soups, but with around 800 to 1,100 calories a day. Then they have 25 days eating what they want - so overall it mimics periods of feast and famine. Previous research has suggested it can slow the pace of ageing. Diabetes therapy? But animal experiments showed the diet regenerated a special type of cell in the pancreas called a beta cell. These are the cells that detect sugar in the blood and release the hormone insulin if it gets too high. Dr Valter Longo, from the University of Southern California, said: \"Our conclusion is that by pushing the mice into an extreme state and then bringing them back - by starving them and then feeding them again - the cells in the pancreas are triggered to use some kind of developmental reprogramming that rebuilds the part of the organ that's no longer functioning.\" There were benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the mouse experiments. Type 1 is caused by the immune system destroying beta cells and type 2 is largely caused by lifestyle and the body no longer responding to insulin. Further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Dr Longo said: \"Medically, these findings have the potential to be very important because we've shown - at least in mouse models - that you can use diet to r\n\nSummary:","44":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Davis was runner-up with Darren Day in third and US reality star Tiffany Pollard in fourth. Ex-EastEnders actors Danniella Westbrook and John Partridge came in fifth and sixth place respectively. Much of the media coverage had come from Stephanie Davis and her flirtation with model Jeremy McConnell. That was despite her having a boyfriend when she entered the house. She told presenter Emma Willis that the experience in the show was \"the hardest thing I have ever had to do in my whole entire life\". Speaking about her boyfriend, Sam Reece, she said: \"Sam broke my heart, and he hurt me, and he knows that. \"Jez (McConnell) came along and he just made me feel like I've never felt before, and made me feel that bit of worth that I've never had for myself.\" Davis - who played Sinead O'Connor in Hollyoaks - left the soap last year amid rumours she was axed, something she denied.

It has proved a promising market for many dog-loving entrepreneurs, who have turned their dreams of canine sushi, neckties and four-poster beds into family-run British businesses. One in four UK households own a dog, adding up to 8.5 million mutts in homes across the country. So there is no shortage of potential customers for even the most unusual pet paraphernalia, some of which is on display in the vast halls of Birmingham's NEC at the Kennel Club's annual dog show - Crufts. Dog tired Courtney Gilbert admits that a four-poster bed for a dog is an \"extravagant touch\". Still in prototype form, the 25-year-old expects to start selling the bed to order for a minimum of \u00a3395. Options include matching the feather and down cushions to the colour of the owner's curtains, and adding a ladder to the side of the bed so a second dog can snuggle down on the top. Miss Gilbert, who is based near Coventry, says the inspiration for the luxury pet bed business came while bored during the holidays as she studied for a fashion degree. Her mum challenged her to design a bed for the family dog. She embellished a bedroom drawer. It proved to be a light bulb moment, as she went on to establish Cosy Chic Pet Boutique during her spare time while still at university. Dog's dinner Dogs love to be rewarded. Suzanne Rothman says they love to be rewarded with sushi. The training treats are half chicken, half fish and used to ensure the animal's full attention during agility and obedience sessions.

But Mr Ramsay's lawyers claim the move is \"unconstitutional\" and warned party members could face legal costs and damages. The association believes it is acting within party rules, BBC Wales was told. Solicitors Sanders Witherspoon have written two letters outlining the Monmouth Member of the Senedd's objections to the process. The most recent, dated 10 November, says the lawyers are preparing \"for an injunction hearing without further notice in the High Court\" and demanding names and addresses to \"serve proceedings\". Relations between the MS and his local party association are thought to have been poor for some time. Asked about the relationship, a source said \"there is clearly a problem\" when \"a candidate tries to sue their entire association and drags them into court\". The source told BBC Wales that local members are unable to give their side of the story on the matter. Earlier this year the MS had been suspended from the party after he was arrested on New Year's Day. He was released without charge two days later. After he took legal action, the Conservative Senedd group was forced to readmit him, before the party later lifted the suspension. 'Breach of contract' The first letter, dated 5 November and initially reported by the Monmouthshire Beacon, demands to know what \"purported constitutional basis and lawful mechanism\" would be used. Accusing the association of \"breach of contract\" and of \"natural justice\", Mr Ramsay's lawyers said they would be instructed to apply for an injunction if the process was not justified in law. They also claim association members are \"jointly and severally liable as individuals for any damage caused to our client in addition to paying his legal costs\".

Twelve points usually means a temporary driving ban unless it can be proved it would cause exceptional hardship. The DVLA said courts were able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver. A Freedom of Information request to the DVLA showed 579 drivers in Wales with 12 penalty points or more, as of 2 April this year. This included three drivers, from Carmarthenshire, Cardiff and Flintshire, with 24 points. Andrew Howard, head of road safety for the AA, said he understood why magistrates had discretion over disqualifications, but added that repeat offending should not be tolerated just because somebody's livelihood relied on being able to drive. \"You can't see why these people are repeatedly doing it - you should be able to see it coming,\" he said. \"The idea is that people get warned for this along the way and see their points totting up. The idea is to clamp down on repeat offenders. \"If you're a repeat offender and you drive for a living, that's not an excuse.\" He said the number of disqualifications had not increased in line with the \"rocketing\" number of endorsements since speed cameras were introduced. \"Whether speed cameras have made some magistrates more sympathetic to the repeat offenders has to be the key question,\" he added. The number of disqualifications in Wales fell to just under 8,000 in 2010 from more than 10,000 in 2009, and over 11,000 in 2008. 'Use their discretion' The DVLA said it was a \"record keeper\" of the decisions taken by courts in sentencing drivers but was \"not privy to the mitigating circumstances offered or accepted in any particular case\".

Authorities had predicted a storm surge of at least 3m (10ft) that was expected to cause extensive damage. Officials say they are better prepared than in 1999 when a cyclone killed thousands of people in Orissa. Cyclone Phailin has been classed as \"very severe\", and the head of India's Meteorological Office, LS Rathore, said it would remain in that category for six hours before losing strength. The eye of the storm was moving at 10-15 km\/h (6-9mph), he said. The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder reported heavy rain and high winds lashing Gopalpur as the cyclone made landfall. 'Apocalyptic devastation' The storm has ripped up trees and road signs, and cut power supplies in some areas. There were reports of window panes being shattered and roofs being blown off. Five deaths were linked to the cyclone by Indian media, four attributed to falling trees and one to a house collapse. Another BBC reporter, Andrew North, spoke of a scene of apocalyptic devastation in Brahmapur, just inland from where the cyclone reached the coast. Store signs and other debris were being pitched high in the air by storm gusts and elaborate decorations for a major Hindu festival were strewn over the main road. Officials had earlier said that no-one would be allowed to stay in mud and thatched houses along the coast of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states, but some residents said they wanted to stay put. \"Many people refused to move, had to be convinced, and at times the police had to forcefully move them to safe places,\" said Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde. The army has been placed on standby for emergency and relief operations. Helicopters and food packages were ready to be dropped in the storm-affected areas. Hours before the cyclone made landfall it was generating winds of 240 km\/h (150mph) over the Bay of Bengal. Most of those evacuated were in Orissa state.

A recent Commission on Assisted Dying report said the terminally ill should be able to end their lives voluntarily. Mr Nicklinson met report author Lord Falconer earlier, saying he wants a doctor to be allowed to end his life. The Commission on Assisted Dying (CAD) published a report in January which concluded there was a \"strong case\" for allowing assisted suicide for people who are terminally ill. But the report said that to take someone else's life would be a \"step too far\". Mr Nicklinson, who cannot speak or move anything except his head and eyes, met CAD chairman Lord Falconer for two hours at his home in Melksham earlier. 'Not acceptable' Communicating through a computer, he told him: \"You say terminally ill people should have the right to die so they don't end up like me, so why should I be forced to live like this?\" Lord Falconer said: \"If somebody can't take the final act themselves then somebody has to, in effect, kill them and I think, and the commission thought as well, that was a step too far. \"It was too risky to allow any situation to arise where one person could kill another that would be lawful. \"Allowing, in any circumstances, one person to kill another would be a massive moral and practical change in the view that the law takes about taking other people's lives. \"That's just not acceptable, I think.\" After the meeting Mr Nicklinson said he was \"satisfied\" that Lord Falconer had answered his questions. \"We must agree to differ on the question of someone killing another.

According to Australian media, Smith was moving into a new home with his fiancee Fiona Docker when he fell ill. An ambulance attended the scene, but attempts to revive him failed. The singer, songwriter and keyboardist was currently on a tour with Mental As Anything, and was the last original member still performing with the band. Affectionately known as \"The Mentals\", they were one of Australia's most popular bands in the 1980s, scoring hits with songs like Too Many Times, If You Leave Me, Can I Come Too? and The Nips Are Getting Bigger. They scored a UK hit in 1987 after their single Live It Up featured in the soundtrack to Crocodile Dundee. Formed as a party covers band in 1978, Smith always maintained their success had been a fluke. \"We didn't have any ambition at all!\" he told NQ Music Press in 2014. \"It was someone else's idea to record us, they started an independent record company and they needed someone to record and they picked us, and it was just luck and everyone liking The Nips Are Getting Bigger that started it all off. \"So we said, 'this is easy!

That propellant is fuel and an oxidiser - a chemical that makes the fuel burn. Engineers wanted to check things worked as expected before the SLS makes its maiden flight in about a year's time. It was part of a testing programme known as the Green Run, that is being carried out at Nasa's Stennis Space Center, near Bay St Louis in Mississippi. This evaluation, known as the wet dress rehearsal (WDR), was the seventh of eight tests on the core stage. Nasa said the rocket responded well to the propellant being loaded. But the test experienced an unexpected shutdown a few minutes earlier than was planned. However, the completion of the WDR should set up the eighth and final test - a \"hotfire\" - where all four RS-25 engines at the base of the core will be fired together for the first time. This very rocket segment will loft the first mission in Nasa's Moon exploration plan - known as Artemis. This mission, which has been scheduled for November 2021, will send the next-generation Orion spacecraft on a loop around Earth's only natural satellite. There will be no crew aboard for this test flight. But the third Artemis mission, in 2024, will land the first humans on the lunar surface since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The Green Run helps ensure any issues are ironed out before the complex rocket segment is transported to Florida to prepare it for launch. Over the course of several hours, engineers at Stennis loaded the core stage with more than 700,000 gallons (roughly 2.6 million litres) of liquid hydrogen and oxygen. \"This is an incredibly exciting time,\" said Jim Maser, senior vice-president at Aerojet Rocketdyne, which builds the RS-25 engines. \"We're really getting to some of the most significant aspects of the testing programme.\" The rocket section is \n\nSummary:","59":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

As one former minister put it \"I don't want him anywhere near my seat - they should continue to send him to places we won't win\". A senior Labour figure described the party's local election performance as \"calamitous\". So much so that some of Mr Corbyn's supporters fear another attempted putsch by his internal opponents. That doesn't seem likely, though. John Curtice: Six key lessons for the general election That's because many of those who are sceptical about his leadership say there is no obvious mechanism to remove him - and he would use any evidence of a plot to excuse a bad general election result. Time and again the phrase they use is that those around Jeremy Corbyn must \"own\" any defeat. The former Labour group leader in Derbyshire, Dave Wilcox, saw control of his council pass to the Conservatives today. He told the BBC he wouldn't be calling for Jeremy Corbyn's resignation right now - but if Labour were to suffer a similar defeat nationally on 8 June, the party leader should go. He told me: \"Genuine Labour supporters have been saying we can't vote for this bloke because he doesn't speak for me. \"We heard it time and time and time again on the doorstep. We are not voting for you while you have Jeremy Corbyn as leader.\" The party's mayoral candidate in the West Midlands, Sion Simon - close to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson - chose to focus not on the party leader to explain his defeat.

In 2016-17 there were 109 investigations into instructor misconduct, which includes inappropriate sexual behaviour. Instructors could be removed from the approved register if they're found to be \"a high risk\". Last year, Newsbeat spoke to one learner driver who had a bad experience with her driving instructor. \"I started noticing little comments. He'd talk about whether I cycled anywhere and said 'You'd look good in Lycra'. \"He added me on Facebook and would ask me questions about whether I was single. As soon as I ended the lessons, I had a text from him asking me out for a drink.\" Jess (not her real name) says this left her \"mortified\" as she thought she was way too young for him. The changes were brought in after MP Richard Graham asked the Prime Minister Theresa May to look into the issue. He said the law should be changed to protect young drivers from \"being groomed by a predatory instructor\" and that instructors should be \"covered by the same rules as teachers\". In 2001, the law was changed to make it illegal for teachers to engage in sexual activity with pupils at their school, if they were aged under 18. The DVSA says it will investigate serious allegations of improper behaviour and refer its findings to the police. It told Newsbeat that could include instructors using sexualised language, unnecessary physical or inappropriate contact and sending indecent messages or images to their pupils. \"We take the safety of learner drivers extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate any complaints about the conduct of instructors and will involve the police where necessary,\" Andy Rice, DVSA Head of Counter-Fraud and Investigations, said. \"Any driving instructors threatening the safety of learner drivers and failing to meet the 'fit and proper' criter\n\nSummary:","61":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The firms had said the merger would create an industrial champion on a par with other global players. France's finance minister, Bruno Le Maire said the decision would \"serve the interests of China\". \"The Commission prohibited the merger because the companies were not willing to address our serious competition concerns,\" Margrethe Vestager, the European competition commissioner said in a statement. \"Without sufficient remedies, this merger would have resulted in higher prices for the signalling systems that keep passengers safe and for the next generations of very high-speed trains,\" she added. Siemens makes ICE trains for Deutsche Bahn and builds units for Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. Alstom manufactures France's TGV bullet train amongst other rolling stock and signalling systems. The tie-up would have created an entity with revenues of approximately \u20ac15bn (\u00a313bn) with significant operations across Europe's rail network. But China's state owned railway behemoth CRRC, the largest global player, has been competing more aggressively for overseas contracts in recent years. Change rules In December Alstom and Siemens submitted proposals to address the Commission's competition concerns. These included selling signalling and rolling stock products. But the measures failed to satisfy the competition authority.

In effect, it would mean Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness would be in charge of planning in certain areas, rather than Mr Attwood. Mr Attwood said he would not support the proposed changes to planning law. The SDLP member added that he did not think OFMDFM should act as a \"planning authority\". The economic zones are due to be debated as part of proposed amendments to Mr Attwood's forthcoming planning bill, due before the Stormont assembly on Monday. Legal challenges BBC Northern Ireland's political editor, Mark Devenport, said: \"This follows on from one clause in the economic pact agreed between Downing Street and the executive, which talked about the executive establishing a new process for economically significant planning applications.\" The clause also makes reference to the executive \"making new arrangements in relation to applications for judicial review of planning decisions\". The DUP and Sinn Fein have both signed up to an amendment that would create economically significant planning zones, within which planning permission \"may be unconditional, or subject to various conditions, specified in a scheme drawn up by OFMDFM\". The proposed changes to planning law follow a number of high profile legal challenges, or judicial reviews, of controversial planning decisions. 'Frustration' But the environment minister said he believes aspects of the DUP\/Sinn Fein amendments could run foul of European law. \"I will not, as the planning minister, as the environment minster, sponsor or support these amendments because, in my view, we do not need OFMDFM to be a planning authority. \"We do not need further frustration of judicial reviews, even though judicial reviews need to change in the future in some ways,\" Mr Attwood said.

Roy Whitney of Unite the union said sites in Port Talbot and Porth would come under the spotlight in the autumn. The UK government says the \u00a3320m budget for disabled employment services could be spent more effectively. The Welsh factories are among 27 Remploy sites which will close. Two other sites which were at risk - Bridgend and Croespenmaen in Caerphilly county - will remain open. Mr Whitney, who has been working at Remploy for 29 years, said even though the Port Talbot and Porth sites were not earmarked for closure, the UK government would look at them in the autumn. \"We were led to believe that they would not look at our situation until at least April 2013, so it's not too good for those sites (Port Talbot and Porth), said Mr Whitney. \"Again now we have this uncertainty hanging over the disabled people in Remploy, which we've had hanging over us for the last four years and it's not doing morale any good at all. \"There's a lot of people in this country who don't really understand how Remploy work. \"We hear things, such as, we work in a ghetto and we should be out in mainstream employment - Remploy is mainstream employment. \"Don't forget, we are not only disabled people working in Remploy, we have fit people working in Remploy.\" The closure of five of Wales' seven Remploy factories is a \"hammer blow\" for workers, says the Welsh government.

Whitehall wants to give firms the right to drill at depths of 300m (984ft) under private land without consent. This is despite opposition to the proposals in a government consultation. A UK government spokesman said: \"The Scottish Government statement ignores the fact most of the powers needed to make Scottish decisions on this matter are already devolved to Holyrood.\" The spokesman claimed local communities in Scotland had full powers to decide whether to approve or decline any proposed shale or geothermal developments. However, Scotland's energy minister said: \"UK government proposals to remove the right of Scottish householders to object to drilling under their homes, without so much as debate in the Scottish Parliament, flies in the face of Scotland's cautious, considered and evidence-based approach on this issue.\" \"It is also fundamentally an issue affecting land ownership rights. \"Whatever your view on the issue of unconventional oil and gas - and it is clear that there are both opportunities and concerns - there is only one way that the people of Scotland can determine the approach in Scotland - including beneath their homes and land. \"That is with the devolution of the necessary powers to Scotland and the current devolution process for the extensive new powers promised in the vow should include these powers.\" Hydraulic fracturing or fracking involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it.

One inmate who died was never given a mental health assessment, despite being classed as a \"vulnerable adult\", jurors at Milton Keynes Coroner's Court heard. Bosses at the jail say procedures there are now more \"robust\". Ryan Harvey - who had a learning disability - died days after arriving at Woodhill on 22 April 2015. Ms Rance told the inquest she asked for a mental health assessment to be carried out on the 23-year-old, but it was never completed. Mr Harvey, who had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, died on 8 May 2015, five days after he was found hanging in his cell. Senior Coroner for Milton Keynes Tom Osborne told the jury prison staff had previously found Mr Harvey with a ligature around his neck, which was not taken away. The inquest jury also heard that despite being observed every 30 minutes, staff did not go in to his cell because he threatened to throw a television at anyone who entered. Ms Rance told the inquest that her team - consisting of one full-time nurse, another part-time nurse, a psychiatrist for part of the week and herself - \"was not sufficient to manage what we needed\". \"My team was tiny.

An LLDC spokeswoman said when the stadium opened would depend on which bid for its future use was successful.

UK Athletics had planned events such as Diamond League meetings, trials and school competitions at the stadium in Stratford. Mr Warner said: \"My biggest concern is that we have some major events planned for that stadium and we thought they were going to be from the summer of 2014 onwards. \"All of the legacy use was scheduled to start in two years' time and now it might be four years' time, which strikes me as ludicrous and to be a paralysis of decision-making which I hope the mayor is going to cut through. \"I wouldn't say this is a Whitehall farce but this is fast becoming a Stratford farce. \"We want to lock into the legacy of the Games while people still remember the Mobot, Greg Rutherford, Jonnie Peacock and David Weir,\" he added.

In the US, travel and energy firms, which are sensitive to concerns about the pandemic, suffered some of the steepest losses. Tech companies were also hit.

The negative sentiment spilled over into Asian markets on Thursday with Australia's ASX 200 down 1.6% while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng index slipped 1.2%. However, these falls were modest compared to US and European bourses. In the UK, mining companies on the FTSE 100 took a hit, while on France's CAC 40 index, which dropped 3.4%, carmaker Renault was the biggest loser with an 8% drop.

She said that in an ideal world there would not be 43 separate police forces across England and Wales. But she also said that mergers were unlikely to happen in the future. The comments were in answer to a question from Det Supt Andy Street from Bedfordshire Police, who asked: \"When will the Acpo (Association of Chief Police Officers) ranks take their share of reduction in numbers being experienced by superintendents and all other ranks?\" Ms Owens said that restructuring the police force would lead to a reduction in chief constables, deputy chief constables, and assistant chief constables. She said she believed this was the best way to meet the financial challenges while protecting frontline services. 'Collaborative arrangements' \"We don't currently have that so we're having to come to collaborative arrangements - I speak on behalf of my own force,\" she said. \"We currently share an assistant chief constable position with Sussex and that does actually come with its own challenges, regardless of the skill of the individual.\" She said she thought there would not be mergers and that it was more likely that under the new police crime commissioners, who are due to be elected in November, there would be more collaboration with neighbouring forces. In August 2011 a joint major crime investigation team, made up of officers from the Surrey and Sussex forces, was created.

About 900 were evacuated as the landslide struck on Sunday. Authorities said a huge man-made mound of earth and construction debris lost stability and collapsed. The city is one of China's biggest and is a major industrial centre. It is situated in the southern province of Guangdong, across the mainland border from Hong Kong. The landslide has blanketed a vast area of 380,000 sq m (455,000 sq yards) covering it with up to 10m (32ft) of mud at an industrial park, Shenzhen's emergency management office said on its official microblog. State news agency Xinhua said that the landslide caused an explosion at a natural gas pipeline. Workers have cleaned up about 400m of damaged pipeline and are now repairing it. China's history of industrial accidents China's land and resources ministry said in a statement on its website that initial investigations showed the landslide happened when a huge mound of soil, cement chunks and other construction waste became unstable. \"Because the mound was very large, and the angle of its slope was overly steep, this led to it losing stability and collapsing,\" it said. People's Daily said the mound had accumulated at a stone quarry that had been converted into a dumping area with its entrance and exit facing an industrial district. Residents evacuated from the surrounding area described hearing loud roars when the landslide happened. Amateur footage of the incident broadcast on state television showed waves of red soil quickly engulfing and crushing buildings.

Other reforms include introducing \"international\" languages in primaries. The Welsh Government said it was working to ensure teachers had the right skills. This included providing intensive Welsh-language training to teachers and teaching assistants through a sabbatical scheme. Analysis By BBC Wales education correspondent Bethan Lewis This responds to long-standing calls for Welsh as a \"second language\" to be ditched. Most agree it has been ineffective in giving young people who do not speak the language at home the skills to use Welsh in everyday life. But there are many questions about how it will work. There is already a shortage of Welsh-speaking teachers - the government said it was working to boost skills but that could take many years. Although the use of Welsh, perhaps through songs and greetings, is already embedded in many English-medium primary schools, boosting provision at secondary level will be much more challenging. And assessment is a key issue. It is logical that the Welsh second language GCSE will ultimately be ditched but it is not clear yet how a single qualification for pupils across all schools would work. The Welsh Government said while it would be up to schools to decide how they approach improving learners' skills, they would need to think about opportunities for learners to listen, read, speak and write in Welsh, possibly in different parts of the curriculum. Welsh, English and \"international\" languages will be included in a new Languages, Literacy and Communication area of learning - one of six broad areas of learning in the new curriculum.

It found there were not enough vehicles or experienced staff, and many complained of being overworked with new recruitment not keeping pace with demands. Staff told inspectors they did not always have access to equipment they needed and availability of vehicles was a \"big issue\". One worker said roadworthiness checks were sometimes missed due to time pressures and once an ambulance battery went flat, requiring the patient's family to jump-start the vehicle. Another said: \"We need more resources, more staff. There is nothing more frustrating than holding on to a call. \"At the end of the day we have targets, but they are people waiting for an ambulance.\" Improvements being made Richard Henderson, the trust's director of operations, said: \"We have plans in place to address each of these areas.\" He said the trust had 110 more frontline staff than a year ago and planned to increase staffing further. \"Alongside that, we have plans in place to address the vehicle and equipment issues and we are confident we do have the correct number of vehicles and equipment across the trust,\" he said. Inspectors said there had been improvements since their last visit. Standards of infection control were being met and a good complaints system was in place.

Others, including celebrities, are embracing their roots, and joining the Silver Sisters social media movement. But should we be reaching for the dye, or is now the time to embrace our roots? 'It was a relief' As a female politician Liz Saville Roberts is sadly used to having her appearance scrutinised by the media and by trolls online. But when in autumn 2018, the MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd decided to stop dyeing her hair she said it was \"literally a relief\". \"A part of me was just utterly fed up of dyeing it regularly. I just didn't want to worry about it any more,\" said the 55-year-old. The leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster, who has naturally dark hair, said she first started seeing greys in her 30s and had even let her husband dye it at one point - leading to some interesting results. But she said once she made the decision her hairdresser helped ease the process, stripping back the colour, so she would not end up with the tell-tale streak at the start. \"I was lucky with my hairdresser embracing it, if I was to have tried myself and dyed it with peroxide I would have come out with something like a mop on my head,\" she said. Ms Saville-Roberts said while it was every woman's choice what they did with their appearance, it was nice to see attitudes towards grey hair changing and women showing off and not covering their roots. \"I am who I am, I am not going to play a game of being someone else,\" she said. \"Life is too short.\" One of the celebrities to embrace her grey hair and join the Silver Sisters, or Goombre movements, is Marina, from Marina and the Diamonds. In one post on Instagram, the singer, who grew up in Abergavenny, said she started getting grey hairs when she was about 15, and had been dyeing her hair since she was 22, as she \"literally thought I had no other option\". \"Grey equalled old to me - something most women are\n\nSummary:","84":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It was unclear if oak processionary caterpillar larvae were even present in the Pangbourne copses, they said. The Forestry Commission said it had \"strong reason to suspect\" it was. It was the first aerial spraying of its kind in the UK and was considered more effective than ground treatments as the caterpillars are attracted to leaves at the top of the trees, the Forestry Commission said. 'Breeding highly likely' The spraying of the pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) took place in Herridge's and Broom Copses, both within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The caterpillar contains a toxin in its hairs that can cause itchy rashes, eye and throat irritations. They feed on oak trees and produce silken nests on trunks and branches. The commission, a government department, said it had destroyed a nest in each copse last year. But Butterfly Conservation's Mark Parsons said the aerial spraying, in May, was \"a disproportionate response\". He said any confirmed nests had been destroyed and that this was \"a precautionary spray just in case any escaped detection last year\". \"It is a sledgehammer to crack a nut,\" he said. A commission spokesman said the discovery of the nests last year \"gave us strong reason to suspect that there would have been others which were not detected\". \"The adult moths which would have emerged from these nests are highly likely to have established a breeding population in the woods, raising the prospect of the pest spreading into other areas,\" he said. 'Really bad impact' Mr Parsons said the strain of the Bt pesticide used \"will kill a wide range of moth and butterfly larvae\", a number of which are scarce in the UK. \"Caterpillars form the food of many birds, which will be feeding their young at this time of year, and therefore there could be a knock-on effect on the \n\nSummary:","85":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Shire said the bid undervalued the firm and would deny shareholders future growth benefits. It also warned about efforts by AbbVie to purchase the firm solely because of its attractive tax base in Ireland. \"The Board also had concerns regarding the execution risks associated with the proposed inversion structure, as AbbVie would redomicile in the UK for tax purposes,\" wrote the firm in a statement announcing its decision. Founded in 1986 in the UK, Shire conducts the majority of its business in the US. It changed its tax base to Ireland in 2008. Shire had rejected two other bids from AbbVie. The firm is seen as an attractive takeover target for US drug firms because it has no single controlling shareholder. AbbVie is just one of several US firms looking to acquire companies in favourable tax locations and then relocate in the lower-tax nation, in a process known as an inversion.

She was not seen in public for months over the summer and went silent on social media, before turning up in early October with a grovelling apology for evading taxes. Two days after she re-appeared, it emerged that the president of global policing agency Interpol, Meng Hongwei, had disappeared on a trip to China. His wife says his last communication with her was a text with a knife emoji, which she took to mean he was in danger. On 8 October, Chinese authorities announced he was being investigated for bribe-taking. While these two cases have triggered a wave of international attention, forced disappearances are nothing new in China. Disappearance, confession, sentence But these latest instances \"show just how fundamental such enforced disappearances have become to governance in China under President Xi\", says Michael Caster, a researcher and author of The People's Republic of the Disappeared. Typically, he says, the scenario plays out like this: The disappearances can target people from different walks of life: human rights lawyers, corrupt officials, officials who are targeted for political reasons, book-sellers who publish material that angers party leaders, or prominent people who fall foul of the party for one reason or another. China's rules always rule Since Xi Jinping took over as China's top leader in 2012, the space for dissent in China has shrunk - and activists say the crackdown is getting tougher and more systematic. President Xi's anti-corruption drive has disciplined more than a million officials since 2012. Critics have long accused the government of using the highly popular campaign as a political tool to target rivals. From a domestic perspective, far more prominent figures - politically speaking - than Ms Fan or Mr Meng have been ensnared.

It comes after another school in Birmingham's Perry Beeches chain - Perry Beeches III - was put in special measures in October 2015. The trust's acting chief executive officer, Paul Wheeler, said issues were being \"addressed\". The Perry Beeches Academy Trust, which runs five schools in the city looking after 2,400 pupils, made headlines earlier this year when a \u00a32.1m deficit was found when Mr Wheeler, then chief financial officer, carried out a health check. It followed the resignation of trust chairman Liam Nolan back in May. An Education Funding Authority investigation had found an additional salary of \u00a3160,000 was paid to Mr Nolan over two years through a third-party agreement - on top of his \u00a3120,000-a-year salary. The trust was issued with a financial notice to improve. In its latest report Ofsted said standards had deteriorated as a direct result of \"weak governance\". See more stories from Birmingham and the Black Country here What the report said Mr Wheeler said: \"There are issues that the report has highlighted and I am addressing those issues along with our trustees.\" The school was inspected on 21 and 22 September.

The fund, which lets people invest in hit songs, has previously splashed out about \u00a31bn snapping up rights to songs from the likes of Mark Ronson, Chic, Barry Manilow and Blondie. Founded by music industry veteran Merck Mercuriadis, Hipgnosis turns music royalties into an income stream. \"This is a deal that changes Hipgnosis forever,\" said Mr Mercuriadis. \"I bought my first Neil Young album aged seven. Harvest was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately. \"Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend and constant ever since.\" Stable investment Hipgnosis has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since July 2018. When songs owned by the fund get played on the radio or placed in a film or TV show, it makes money. Before setting up Hipgnosis, Mr Mercuriadis managed artists such as Beyonc\u00e9, Elton John, Iron Maiden and Guns 'N' Roses. In his view, songs are \"as investible as gold or oil\". He says hit songs are a stable investment because their revenue is unaffected by fluctuations in the economy. The sale of song catalogues has become a booming business during the Covid-19 pandemic, with investors seeing music as a relatively stable asset in an otherwise turbulent market. Earlier this week, Hipgnosis bought 100% of the rights to Lindsey Buckingham's 161 songs for an undisclosed amount. The songs include hits that Buckingham wrote or co-wrote for Fleetwood Mac, including Go Your Own Way and The Chain. The group's Stevie Nicks sold 80% of her publishing rights last year to Hipgnosis rival Primary Wave for about $80m.

On Friday night, a separate crew from the Republic was based at Newry ambulance station. An NIAS spokesman said it was 10 crews short on Saturday night, but many staff members who were off had come in. He said they were working partial shifts through the busiest period. In addition, eight private and voluntary ambulances were dealing with non life-threatening cases. The NIAS had appealed for staff to come to work over the weekend over difficulties filling rotas. Internal correspondence, seen by the BBC, said NIAS advised health trusts of possible delays in response times for \"less urgent\" cases. It asked for assistance from the Republic of Ireland, among other extra measures. There is an understanding between the ambulance services on both sides of the border that they will help each other out in special circumstances. NIAS chief executive Michael Bloomfield said they were down 14 crews out of 52 on Friday night. \"That's substantial, that's over a quarter,\" he said. \"I've been advised that last night there were no significant issues of concern to report, but people will have waited longer and I apologise for that.\" He warned of the potential for further delays over the weekend. Sources have claimed NIAS is at \"crisis point\", with the Southern Health Trust area particularly affected. Mr Bloomfield said the NIAS faced a similar situation on Saturday night, but was working to address it by continuing to identify people who were willing to come in.

Currently, the batteries in its Leaf electric cars are imported from Japan. Nissan would not confirm if this would mean additional jobs at Sunderland, which is the UK's largest car plant. Manufacturing the more powerful batteries in the UK will ensure its cars comply with trade rules agreed with the EU requiring at least 55% of the car's value to be derived from either the UK or the EU to qualify for zero tariffs when exported to the EU. Some 70% of the cars made in Sunderland are exported and the vast majority of them are sold in the EU. Nissan had issued stark warnings last year that if the UK left the EU without a trade deal, the resulting tariffs on cars and components would make the Sunderland plant \"unsustainable\". Nissan's chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta told the BBC: \"The Brexit deal is positive for Nissan. Being the largest automaker in the UK we are taking this opportunity to redefine auto-making in the UK. \"It has created a competitive environment for Sunderland, not just inside the UK but outside as well. \"We've decided to localise the manufacture of the 62kWh battery in Sunderland so that all our products qualify [for tariff-free export to the EU].

Farah province, which borders Iran, is a centre of opium poppy cultivation in western Afghanistan. The attack in Bala Buluk district comes two weeks after a similar assault by the Taliban on an army base in the same province. At least 22 members of the security forces died in the attack.

Matt Hancock has criticised the reliance of treating long-term illnesses with drugs, and said culture therapy could save the NHS money. But the Alzheimer's Society has said that the arts is not a \"silver bullet\". \"Social prescription reduces over-prescription of drugs,\" said Mr Hancock, speaking at the King's Fund health think tank on Tuesday. \"It can lead to the same or better outcomes for patients without popping pills. And it saves the NHS money. Because many of these social cures are free.\" The health secretary called the arts an \"indispensable tool\" for doctors to help patient recovery, and said culture could be considered in place of drugs to treat long-term medical conditions such as dementia. Under the new plans, trips to libraries and concert halls - as well as 'personal playlists' of music - could be prescribed to help patients and their families cope with the symptoms of degenerative mental diseases. A National Academy for Social Prescribing will also be established as a base for GPs to receive training about how the arts can improve health. \"We've been fostering a culture that's popping pills and Prozac,\" said Mr Hancock. \"When what we should be doing is more prevention and perspiration.\" The plans follow Mr Hancock's announcement of his long-term vision for the NHS, focused on preventing illness. No silver bullet Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said social prescribing \"is not a new phenomenon\", but that encouraging patients to take up new hobbies could have a positive impact. \"Preventing people from becoming ill by emphasising the importance of preventative measures is a step in the right direction, but we need the right resources if we're going to be able to deliver far more of this kind of care,\" she said.

It was alleged music was lost in the fire. Most later dropped their claims when it was demonstrated they suffered no loss. Only Tom Petty's ex-wife Jane was still involved but a judge on Monday said she had not filed enough evidence. Judge John A Kronstadt, sitting in a California court, dismissed the claim. One part of the dismissal stated that Tom Petty didn't technically own the masters that were lost - they belonged to his former record label, MCA, which is now owned by UMG. 'Greatest music' The group of claimants had originally asked for $100m (\u00a382m) in damages. The case was brought following a New York Times investigation which alleged that hundreds of thousands of master recordings, protection copies, unreleased music and other materials had burned in a massive warehouse fire in 2008. Several artists alleged UMG was in breach of contract after not sharing a settlement it reached with insurers and accused the record company of not doing enough to prevent the fire. In a statement, UMG said: \"As we have said all along, the New York Times Magazine articles at the root of this litigation were stunning in their overstatement and inaccuracy. \"As always, we remain focused on partnering with artists to release the world's greatest music.\" In a statement, Jake Silverstein, the editor of the New York Times Magazine, said: \"We stand by Jody Rosen's reporting.

Meanwhile the Education Authority is getting \u00a319m to help ease pressures on pay for teachers and other non-teaching staff. This can be used to address the backlog in assessment and diagnosis as well as cover costs such as transport. Addressing the assembly chamber, Finance Minister Conor Murphy was questioned about why he had not allocated a sufficient amount of money to settle an ongoing pay dispute with teachers. He said the allocated \u00a319m is for the \"contractual pay costs for teachers\" and other non-teaching staff in 2019-20. \"Obviously there will have to be further discussions when we go to set the budget next month in relation to the outstanding pay issues,\" he added. Responding to the special needs education allocation, Justin McCamphill of teaching union NASUWT welcomed the announcement but said the money would not be enough to deal with pressures on the system. He said the number of children with special needs had \"increased dramatically\". \"There is a long way to go.

He also said voters had not been given enough facts before the EU referendum. \"The unintended consequences of Brexit will be significant for everyone across the UK,\" he said.

This was because the terms of a potential Brexit deal were still unclear. \"It is that uncertainty that is causing problems,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said a bigger worry was whether banks would retain their \"passporting rights\" after Britain leaves the bloc. These rights currently allow them to trade across the bloc without the need for individual country licences. He said: \"I am convinced that London will retain its reputation as a prestigious global financial services centre. \"But clearly some size of our businesses will have to be moved out of London into European headquarters with the absence of any passporting agreement - but it's very hard to ascertain what that will mean at the moment.\" He also said Brexit was damaging efforts to implement the Capital Markets Union, a European Commission initiative to bolster the low use of capital markets to finance European companies and infrastructure projects.

The government's aviation minister Robert Goodwill has described its threatened closure as \"disturbing\". In an email to customers seen by the BBC, Mr Buchanan said the situation had arisen as a result of \"ongoing operational losses\". He said \"the lack of reliable prospect of profitability in the medium term\" was another reason. A task force is being set up to assess the impact and help support the 144 staff affected, while a petition against the closure has already attracted more than 5,000 signatures. On Thursday, Thanet MP Sir Roger Gale asked Mr Goodwill in Parliament to look into how the airport could be kept open in the \"national interest\". National asset Mr Goodwill told the Commons he would meet him to talk about its future. The airport was bought by the co-founder of the Stagecoach Group, Ann Gloag, for \u00a31 in October last year. Sir Roger said he believed the former RAF airfield was a national asset which should be kept open. He told the House of Commons: \"Yesterday the owner of Manston in Kent announced the proposed closure of that very important airfield. \"Given that Manston has the fourth-longest runway in the country, is a major diversion field and a search and rescue base would my right honourable friend, in the national interest, review this to see how Manston may be kept open?\" 'Devastating blow' Mr Goodwill replied: \"It's disappointing that Manston has not been able to attract some of the low cost carriers that they were hoping to do so, but I'll be happy to meet with the honourable gentlemen to see if there can be a way forward.\" Travel journalist Simon Calder believes there is an \"inevitability\" about Manston's closure, however.

But it does not then anticipate a sharp rebound in the current quarter - growth is forecast in the third quarter at 0.3%. Taken together, the Bank now believes that PM Boris Johnson has inherited an economy not in recession, but in the middle of a weak six-month stretch in growth. Now, some of that is down to \"volatile\" UK data. Stockpiling boosted the economy in the first quarter, but that will more than reverse. The shutdowns in car factories around no-deal Brexit plans for March also dragged on the economy, but should at least partially bounce back around now. But the bigger picture is that the Bank has amassed evidence that businesses small and large now believe that Brexit uncertainty, over ongoing trading arrangements with the EU, is bigger in size and longer-lasting than three months ago. Alongside slower global growth, this has hit business investment and therefore underlying growth too. High chance of recession There is now a one-in-three chance, the Bank calculates, of an annual contraction in growth by early next year, which almost certainly signals a recession - the highest since immediately after the referendum. However, the entire exercise is \"affected by an inconsistency\", acknowledges the Bank. While it has chosen to forecast a smooth Brexit, since Theresa May failed to pass her withdrawal deal, markets have been increasingly pricing in the chances of a leaving the EU without a deal. Some markets see a 40% chance of no-deal. It can be seen in the sterling slide most obviously, but also in trading of UK government debt, which now presumes the Bank will cut, rather than raise interest rates, by\n\nSummary:","101":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

There will also be talks, seminars and an army of ardent fans dressed for the occasion. The Glasgow Comic Con at Queen's Cross Church in Maryhill sold out months ago, largely because many of the big name attractions. Many artists and writers producing some of the top-selling comics around the globe are Scots, living and working in their native country. Comics matter to Scotland for a number of reasons; for a start, Dundee is home to DC Thompson, the publishers behind The Beano, The Dandy, Oor Wullie and The Broons - with Dundee University recently announcing the UK's first-ever post-graduate degree course in comics studies. Coatbridge to Hollywood Writer Mark Millar is unquestionably one of the most popular and influential comic creators in the world; having spent his formative years in his native Coatbridge, he now resides in Glasgow where he tirelessly produces hit after hit. Millar's comic-book series Wanted was adapted into a Hollywood action movie starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy with a production budget of $75m. It grossed $340m worldwide and a sequel is in pre-production. More importantly, the story and characters are not owned by a large corporation like Marvel or DC Comics in the way Batman, Superman and the X-Men are - it is entirely creator-owned by Millar and his artist collaborator JG Jones. Similarly, Millar's controversial Kick-Ass comic series, which told the story of a young New Yorker who decides to become a super-hero despite possessing no special powers or skills, sold in the hundreds of thousands and grossed more than $100m when it was transformed for the big screen in 2010. His next comics-to-screen adaptation, Nemesis, a deliberate inversion of the superhero concept - where the villain is the central character of the story - is being directed by Tony Scott of Top Gun fame.

A drugs counsellor and former user told the BBC the NHS was \"creating drug addicts\". The Royal College of GPs said doctors would not prescribe opioid painkillers as a \"quick fix\". Opioids such as morphine, tramadol and fentanyl are super-strength painkillers, which can be highly addictive and can kill if misused. An investigation by BBC News has found: The latest figures show the number of people dying from opioid-related drug misuse has reached a record high in England and Wales. About 3,700 people died in 2016 because of drug misuse. More than 2,000 of these deaths involved an opioid, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). However these figures also included deaths from heroin, which is made from morphine. 'Feeding people with pills' Abuse of opioids can start at an early age. \"I got my first taste of prescription painkillers when I was 14,\" said Nicki Hari. \"After having my tonsils out I remember thinking opioid based painkillers are great. They give you a floaty feeling, like you're on pink fluffy cloud.\" Ms Hari, from Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, said a 25-year addiction saw her \"manipulate\" doctors into prescribing her painkillers and various types of surgery she said she did not need. \"I must have had over 10 operations on different parts of my body just so I could get more painkillers,\" she said. Ms Hari now works for UK Addiction Treatment, which runs a network of recovery centres. \"Most doctors will give you tablets like Tramadol without asking too many questions,\" she said. \"GPs are just feeding people with pills, and the result is that the NHS is creating drug addicts.\" 'Patients demand strong painkillers' Analysis of the England and Wales crime survey by the BBC England data unit suggests about 2.3 million people aged 16 to 59 in England took a prescription painkiller that had not been prescribed for them in \n\nSummary:","103":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The singer has also been announced as the second headliner at this year's Latitude Festival. The event is taking place at Henham Park, near Southwold, for a ninth year between 17-20 July with Two Door Cinema Club, Billy Bragg and Haim already announced. In addition to his work with Blur, Albarn has had a number of other projects, including his The Good, The Bad And The Queen album (which he performed at Latitude in 2007), his Mali Music collaboration and Gorillaz. The singer has also released soundtracks to the stage productions he has scored, Monkey: Journey To The West and Dr Dee. Blur bandmate Alex James revealed last week that he had applied to trademark a drink called Britpop. The musician, who also produces his own cheeses, has applied to the intellectual property office (IPO) for the trademark. Blur's first album Leisure was released in 1991 with their most recent release, Think Tank, coming out in 2003. Albarn, James and their Blur bandmates Graham Coxon and Dave Rowntree, performed together for a Hyde Park show in 2012, which coincided with the end of the Olympics.

The scheme allowed most council tenants who lived in their homes for five years the chance to buy it and get a \u00a38,000 discount on its value. Community Secretary Carl Sargeant said the five-year suspension would ensure social housing was available for those who need it. The move comes as Welsh Government legislation to abolish the right to buy across the whole of Wales is proceeding through the assembly. Anglesey, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Flintshire and Denbighshire have already suspended Right to Buy. Manifesto pledge Councillor Lynda Thorne, Cardiff's cabinet member for housing, said the city had about 8,300 people on the waiting list for social housing. \"We have to do everything we can to ensure we are providing good quality housing for those most in need, both now and into the future,\" she said. \"In 1985 the council had 23,000 properties but, largely through the right to buy, that figure has reduced to our current stock in the region of 13,400 properties.\" She said the authority was committed to delivering 1,000 affordable council homes over the next five years. Ending the flagship policy of former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was pledged in Welsh Labour's assembly election manifesto. Mr Sergeant said: \"This damaging policy is further increasing the pressure on our social housing supply and is forcing many vulnerable people to wait longer for a home. \"Legislating to end the right to buy is the only sure way to prevent this and give social landlords the confidence to invest in building more of the affordable homes Wales needs.\"\n\nSummary:","105":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The graves in the Argentine memorial cemetery, in Darwin, are currently marked as \"soldier only known to God\". The two-month conflict saw 649 Argentine soldiers killed, while 255 British service personnel died. The conflict saw a taskforce recapture the British overseas territory in the South Atlantic after an invasion by Argentina. In total, 237 Argentine soldiers are buried in the cemetery. The work on identifying the unknown men is expected to take place between June and August next year, according to a report on the Argentine news agency Telam. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan signed the deal with Argentina's deputy foreign minister Pedro Villagra Delgado following talks in London.

The members of a militia group called the Crusaders also kept watch on the target in Garden City, officials said. They allegedly planned to strike on 9 November, a day after the US elections. The suspects had prepared a manifesto and conspired to detonate a bomb at apartments where Somalis were among some 120 residents, said prosecutors. They allegedly discussed parking four explosives-packed vehicles at the corners of the complex to create a large blast in the meatpacking town. Mr Stein offered to provide ammonium nitrate for the devices and contribute up to $300 (\u00a3246) for other materials, according to prosecutors. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Acting US Attorney Tom Beall said the eight-month investigation had taken FBI agents \"deep into a hidden culture of hatred and violence\". A confidential source attended meetings of the militia group to collect information, according to documents. In one of those gatherings, papers said, there was a proposal to carry out an attack similar to the Orlando nightclub shooting. Mr Beall said they ultimately decided to attack the building because of the number of Somalis who lived there.

Fifty years on from the find, scientists from the University of Edinburgh and National Museums Scotland are preparing a detailed study of it. It has been identified as being from a family of animals called ichthyosaurs. The ancient reptiles grew to about 4m (13ft) in length and had long, pointed heads filled with hundreds of cone-shaped teeth, which they used to feed on fish and squid. The Storr Lochs Monster is the most complete skeleton of a sea-living reptile from the \"Age of Dinosaurs\" that has ever been found in Scotland, the researchers said.

The party has agreed to scrap the president's role, give members an equal vote, and set up a leader's team which it says will ensure clearer leadership. Plaid leader Leanne Wood said they were exciting changes that would strengthen the way the party worked. \"Our aim is to become the party of government in 2016, and these changes will help us achieve that aim,\" she said. \"The creation of a leadership team will ensure that there is greater accountability for the decisions we take as a party from our elected members at all levels, and will mean that there is clearer leadership. \"The leadership team will also incorporate the work of the president. \"The decision to overhaul this long-established post within the party is an historic one, and one which is indicative of our commitment to the renewal and re-evaluation of the way we operate.\" An internal party report published last year made a number of recommendations that form the basis of the constitution. The review, called Moving Forward and led by Plaid's economic policy adviser Eurfyl ap Gwilym, recognised the party's lack of electoral progress. It laid out structural and membership recommendations that will be reflected in the new constitution. Mr ap Gwilym said of the revised constitution: \"The changes agreed by the party today are extremely important for achieving the goals set out by Camu 'Mlaen, and I am glad that they have won the support of our members.

VW shares crashed after disclosure in 2015 that its diesel technology emitted illegal levels of pollution. \"VW should have told the market that they cheated,\" Andreas Tilp, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the court. \"We believe that VW should have told the market no later than June 2008 that they could not make the technology that they needed in the United States,\" he told the Braunschweig higher regional court. Shareholders representing 1,670 claims are seeking compensation for the near 40% slide in Volkswagen's share price triggered by the scandal, which broke in September 2015 and has cost the firm \u20ac27.4bn in penalties and fines so far. Criminal probe The legal action has been brought by the Deka investment fund, which is being used a template for a further 1,600 lawsuits. The case involves about 50 lawyers, and interest in the hearing is so great that it had to be moved from the court house to a nearby conference centre. In a short statement to the BBC, VW pointed out that the \"lawsuit is solely and exclusively about whether Volkswagen complied with its disclosure obligations toward shareholders and the capital markets\". The company said it was \"confident\" it had carried out its obligations correctly. The court case is expected to take at least until next year to be fully decided. Former executives from VW, Porsche and their sister company Audi are under criminal investigation in Germany. The company itself has already been fined \u20ac1bn by German prosecutors over its diesel emissions scandal. It has also paid a fine of $4.3bn in the US to resolve criminal and civil penalties.

However, after closing, the building fell into disrepair and was listed as one the most at-risk Victorian buildings in England and Wales. Offices at the old Bute Road premises open on Monday, with a cafe and cocktail bar set to follow in July. Simon Baston, of developers Loftco, said they took a \"sympathetic approach\" to a Grade II*-listed building \"in a serious state of disrepair\". The building was home to the first steam-powered passenger rail service in Wales which opened in October 1840 and subsequently became the head office of the Taff Vale Railway until 1862. For many years, the building has laid empty and boarded up and became an eyesore in Cardiff Bay although trains still call at the station. In 2016, the Victorian Society named it as one of the 10 most endangered Victorian and Edwardian buildings in Britain. It has now been transformed with the help of a \u00a31m loan from Cardiff Council, in partnership with the Welsh Government's Town Centre Loan Scheme, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Mr Baston, whose company was also behind the Tramshed regeneration project in nearby Grangetown, said they were \"proud to have converted one of Cardiff's most important and striking buildings\". Councillor Russell Goodway, Cardiff cabinet member for investment and development, said: \"The building will have a new lease of life providing high-quality business start-up space to complement an already vibrant business offer within Cardiff Bay.\" Hannah Blythyn, the Welsh Government's deputy minister for housing and local government, added: \"It is great to see how the Town Centre Loan Scheme has been used to help revitalise this historic building.\" Rail services to Cardiff Bay are due to be revamped as part of the South Wales Metro transport project, with the line to be extended and a new station built closer to the Wales Millennium Centre.\n\nSummary:","123":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It said it would mean \"no involuntary furloughs or cuts in pay rates or benefits for the next six months\". Staff will also be offered \"enhanced voluntary leave and early retirement options\". Last year the company made a $2.9bn profit and returned $1.3bn to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, according to Bloomberg. Under the massive $2.2tn coronavirus relief bill passed by the US Congress last week, $50bn was set aside for airlines with half given as grants. The other half will be offered as loans in exchange for not furloughing employees until at least 30 September. American Airlines, the world's biggest by passenger numbers, said it hoped to be back to flying a full schedule by then. \"These funds are being distributed to ensure continuation of essential airline service and protect jobs. We intend to apply for these funds and are confident that, along with our relatively high available cash position, they will allow us to fly through even the worst of potential future scenarios,\" said the email to staff from chief executive Doug Parker and president Robert Isom.

But an error meant they were not sent out until just before consultation began on the scheme, a month later. Herefordshire Council has apologised and said it \"was not acceptable for residents to find out through the press or social media\". Contractor Balfour Beatty Living Places was due to send out the letters but did not, which its managing director Steve Helliwell said had been \"human error\". The firm apologised to those affected. Residents of Kings Acre Road said they only received letters last week and many only realised the situation when they saw the possible routes online. Resident Justyn Waite said: \"We got a small apology in a letter from Balfour Beatty blaming a clerical error which isn't good enough and we've missed the first consultation because of this. \"Obviously if we are right under the path, our house will be demolished, compulsory purchase I would have thought. \"Our biggest fear is we're not directly under the route and we're right next to the road, what do we do then? What happens to the house?\" Herefordshire Council said once the mistake was realised, a second letter was sent out to all residents and landowners inviting them to a preview of the plans to discuss the potential impact of the options on their property. The people who should have received the letters were not all people that would have homes affected, but also those with land interests.

Last week, blogger Ahmed Rajib Haider was killed outside his home. The protests come days after authorities blocked some websites for \"hurting religious feelings\". In the capital, Dhaka, thousands of protesters from an alliance of Islamic parties went on a protest rally soon after Friday prayers in the country's national mosque. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse protesters who threw stones and vandalised buildings, the BBC's Anbarasan Ethirajan reports from Dhaka. Similar violent clashes were reported across the country. In some places, there were clashes between supporters of the ruling Awami League and Islamist activists, our correspondent reports. Following Mr Haider's death last week a series of blog posts described as anti-Islamic have circulated, but their authorship was not immediately clear. Strike call The clashes come amid renewed tension over a tribunal judging war crimes committed during the 1971 independence war. Last week, Bangladesh's parliament amended a law which will allow the state to appeal against the life sentence given by the tribunal to an Islamist party leader. In recent weeks a group of bloggers, including Mr Haider, had launched mass protests demanding his execution and a ban on the country's largest Islamist party, the Jamaat-e-Islami. Islamist parties have called for a nationwide general strike on Sunday in protest at the killing of their supporters in recent clashes. The Islamist party denies being involved in war crimes and says the tribunal is part of a government vendetta against the party. Human rights groups have said the tribunal falls short of international standards.

Statisticians suggest the fall is due to the increasing use of e-cigarettes as an alternative to tobacco. Women accounted for 57% of all attempts to quit smoking. More than a third were by people living in \"most deprived\" areas. The figures suggest the majority of those who do give up smoking are unable to stay off tobacco in the longer term. Provisional statistics released by NHS Services Scotland reveal there were 103,431 attempts to stop smoking in 2013, compared to 119,428 the previous year - the first fall in recent years. The total number of pregnant women trying to stop smoking also fell to 2,918, down from 3,073 the previous year. In three quarters of cases, smokers used services offered by pharmacies such as nicotine replacement therapy. Specialist cessation services saw fewer clients, but had the highest success rates.

Authorities say the operation aims to make the city safer ahead of the World Cup in 2014 and Olympic Games in 2016. Drug gangs have fought back over the past week, firing on police and setting fire to cars and buses. Local media reported hearing the sound of gunshots and grenades exploding as the security forces remain poised to move into the favela's steep and narrow alleyways. Dozens of people - many of them suspected drug traffickers - have died in the violence. \"There is not the slightest chance traffickers can win in this war in Alemao,\" military police chief Sergio Duarte told reporters. \"We are in position to invade Alemao at any moment. It's better they give themselves in now and bring their weapons while there's still time, because when we invade, it's going to be more difficult.\" 'At risk' The suspected traffickers fled to Alemao from the Vila Cruzeiro favela after police took control of it earlier this week.

It is also believed faeces was smeared on the pages of a psalm book. The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rev Ken Good, described the incident as \"sacrilege\". Police have yet to establish a motive for the attack, which they say happened sometime between Sunday afternoon and Tuesday at about 16:15 BST. It is believed the vandals broke in through one of the church's stained-glass windows. The worst of the damage was inflicted on the church's organ, said Robert Miller, the parish's rector. \"They climbed in behind the organ and used broken glass - probably from the bottles of altar wine which they had smashed - to cut parts of the mechanism which makes the organ work.\" He added that the organ would be out of action for some time. \"Our church organist was heartbroken when he saw the extent of the damage,\" he said. \"The instrument was installed in 2000, four years after the previous organ had been destroyed in a fire. So, this latest act of vandalism has come as a severe blow to us.\" The vandals also smashed windows, knocked over vases of flowers and removed a bible from a lectern and flung it into the church's sanctuary. \"There seems to be just a mindlessness to it.

Ministers want to reduce the number of councils from 22 to eight or nine. Council leaders said they had \"responded positively\" in seeking new ways of running services. Five years into the longest period of sustained spending reductions since World War Two, he said public services needed to be reformed, but that had been \"overshadowed\" by local government reorganisation. 'Longer term' The Welsh government's council merger plans have had a hostile reception from political opponents and some Labour council leaders. \"There has been a lot of debate about the nature of services, but it has been overshadowed by what kind of structure of local government we want,\" Mr Thomas said. \"What's more important for people is not necessarily what council is there, but the services they are providing, it's certainly been a distraction. \"It's affected, I think, the ability of some councils to think beyond four or five year horizons. They need to think much longer term.\" He said councils in England were \"redesigning themselves\" and \"we need to be doing the same in Wales\". \"But there's almost a desire to do as little change as is needed,\" Mr Thomas said. Cuts in Westminster have cost devolved services \u00a31.2bn in real terms (7%) since 2010 and that is predicted to rise to \u00a31.8bn (11%) by 2019-20.

Past presidents, pizzeria owners and historians were among the estimated 1,500 mourners at St Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston. Mrs Bush, a literacy campaigner, died at her home on Tuesday, aged 92. The first lady from 1989 to 1993 had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Her son Jeb Bush, Florida's ex-governor, drew laughs from the crowd in a eulogy at the church where his parents have worshipped since the 1950s. The 2016 presidential candidate said he knew what his \"role model\" mother would say to him if she were there, which included \"keep it short\" and \"don't get weepy\". Historian and author Jon Meacham and friend Susan Baker, the wife of former Secretary of State James Baker, also shared stories of Mrs Bush's sharp tongue, fierce devotion to her family and charming humour. US President Donald Trump decided against attending the invite-only service, saying in a statement that his absence was \"to avoid disruptions due to added security, and out of respect for the Bush Family\".

Researchers said identifying the mechanism could lead to new therapies in the future. About 10,000 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with bladder cancer. 'Mechanism manipulation' Bladder cancer becomes invasive when the illness grows through the muscle layer of the bladder. When this occurs, there is a higher risk the cancer would spread to other areas and becomes more difficult to treat, researchers say. The newly-published research by the university, in the American Journal of Physiology: Renal Physiology, looks at a protein, pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI), which is present in most bladder cancers. Researchers, led by Prof Raymond Playford and Dr Tanya Marchbank, said they had identified the role PSTI played in the signalling process that allowed the cancer's spread. Developing ways to interrupt the process could lead to new treatments, researchers said. Professor Playford said: \"Although bladder cancer can be readily treated if caught early enough, once it starts to invade into deeper tissues and spread to distant sites, it is a much more difficult, painful and life-affecting cancer to live with. \"By identifying the mechanism by which bladder cancer develops and spreads, we hope that in time therapies that manipulate this mechanism may be developed to improve the quality of life and survival rates of those with invasive bladder cancer.\"\n\nSummary:","136":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

This is how the story has been covered around the world: ICIJ, United States When the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its media partners contacted HSBC for comment, the bank at first insisted that ICIJ destroy the data. However, in January, after being informed of the full extent of the reporting team's findings, HSBC gave a final response that was more conciliatory, says the ICIJ. \"In the past, the Swiss private banking industry operated very differently to the way it does today,\" said the bank. \"In some cases individuals took advantage of bank secrecy to hold undeclared accounts,\" it said, adding \"we have taken significant steps over the past several years to implement reforms.\" In addition to the statement, HSBC repeated that \"we do not comment on specific clients, even to confirm whether or not they are or ever were clients.\" HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers 106,000 clients with Swiss bank accounts 203 countries involved $118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts 11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn 9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn 7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bn The Guardian, UK While Swiss banks are often mentioned in crime thrillers, as \"shady havens for James Bond types, super-villains and African dictators,\" said the Guardian, outside fictional accounts it \"has been virtually impossible until now to get at the reali\n\nSummary:","140":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (ICIBI) will also carry out an inspection at Penally camp in Pembrokeshire, where a protest took place in October. Inspectors' reports will be published by the Home Office, the ICIBI said. Journalist Andy Aitchison, who was held after photographing a protest at Napier Barracks, has said \"bad things are going on there\". The Home Office has said the barracks provided safe and secure accommodation. The site was used to house about 400 asylum seekers until some were moved to self-isolation following a Covid-19 outbreak. Protests also took place at the Penally military training camp near Tenby in a row about conditions. Some of those housed there claimed the conditions are unsafe and they had been put at risk from coronavirus. Inspectors from ICIBI and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) are planning to visit both sites next week, an ICIBI spokesman said. A report will be published by Home Secretary Priti Patel \"in due course\", he added. \"As with all ICIBI inspections, the Independent Chief Inspector will raise any matters requiring urgent attention with the Home Office, or directly with ministers, in advance of submitting his full inspection report,\" he said. On Thursday, Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford told the House of Lords that Napier Barracks was \"fit for purpose\". She said the accommodation was safe, warm and to an \"appropriate standard\". Labour's Lord Dubs said it was not acceptable for some asylum seekers to be held in conditions where those with Covid-19 could not self-isolate. Lord Dubs said there was \"inadequate\" medical attention and a lack of hot food and hot water. In a letter to the home secretary, church leaders have called for an end to the use of military barracks as a temporary home for asylum seekers.

On Tuesday, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the relationship between the two governments was \"regular and thorough\". Mr Drakeford made the comments during an interview with Sky News. His words contrast with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement, in Downing Street on Monday, pledging to \"build the biggest possible consensus across business, across industry, across all parts of our United Kingdom, across party lines\" on how to ease the restrictions. In Wednesday's interview, Mr Drakeford said he had always been in favour of a \"four nation approach\". \"The four nations of the United Kingdom took a decision to go into lockdown on the same day, and with the same measures in place, and my preference is to come out of lockdown in the same way - common measures to a common timetable across the United Kingdom,\" the first minister said. \"But if we can't agree on that and it's a bit of a struggle, I have to say, to get the UK government to engage with us on that agenda, we are preparing our own thinking, our own possible measures.\" Mr Drakeford added: \"My preference is to do it together. \"If we can't reach that point then, of course, my responsibility will be to make the decisions that are right for Wales.\" However, in evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Mr Hart said communications between the administrations needed to work in both directions.

The potential risk of copycat incidents after celebrity cases is known to public health bodies. It cannot be known for certain if his death led to the spike but it appeared to be connected, the new study said. Experts say \"irresponsible\" media coverage of suicides can play a big part in copycat cases. 'Twenty-four-hour news cycle' Williams, who starred in films such as Good Morning, Vietnam and Good Will Hunting, was found dead in August 2014. At the time of his death, the Samaritans warned about a large number of news articles giving too much detail about the nature of his suicide, against media guidelines. Guidance from the World Health Organization, the Independent Press Standards Organisation's editors' code of practice, the Ofcom broadcasting code and the BBC's editorial guidelines all advise against going into explicit detail about the methods used. However, researchers said there was \"substantial evidence\" that many media outlets had tended to deviate from these guidelines. For the latest study, they looked at the monthly suicide rates from the US government Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between January 1999 and December 2015 to see if there had been a spike. They found there were 18,690 suicides between August and December 2014 compared with the 16,849 cases they would have expected. In the weeks after Williams's death, there was a \"drastic\" increase in references to suicide and death in news media reports, as well as more posts on an internet suicide forum researchers monitored, the study found. David Fink, one of the study's authors, from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said research had previously shown that suicide rates increased following a high-profile celebrity suicide, but this was a first time such a study had been done within the era of the 24-hour news cycle.

If confirmed, it is thought it would be the first such incident in the UK. BA said it would give the police \"every assistance with their investigation\". No arrests have been made, police say. The Metropolitan Police said the plane was hit by the drone at about 1,700ft (580m) while flying over the area of Richmond Park, in south west London. No debris has been found and police have asked for anyone who finds drone parts in the Richmond area to come forward. The force's aviation security unit, based at Heathrow, is leading the investigation. 'Very real danger' After safely landing the plane, the pilot reported an object had struck the front of the Airbus A320. A BA spokesman said: \"Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight.\" Chief Superintendent Martin Hendy, head of the Met's aviation policing command, said the incident highlighted \"the very real dangers of reckless, negligent and some times malicious use of drones\". A Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesman said it was \"totally unacceptable\" to fly drones - which are generally used to capture aerial film or photographs - close to airports.

The exhibition, Alexander Calder: Performing Sculpture, opens at London's Tate Modern on 11 November. It is billed as \"the most comprehensive exhibition\" of the American artist's work ever to be held in the UK. Tate's director of exhibitions, Achim Borchardt-Hume, said: \"We thought it time to look at Calder as a serious artist again.\" The show will bring together approximately 100 works to reveal how Calder (1898-1976) changed the idea that sculpture was a static object into something that could be continually changing. \"Historically, sculpture was a solid object that you had to walk around to experience in three dimensions,\" said Borchardt-Hume at Monday's launch event. \"Calder turned this upside down. He makes sculpture move. We no longer move around it - it moves for us.\" Calder initially trained as an engineer before studying painting in New York. He travelled to Paris in the 1920s where he developed his wire sculptures and, by 1931, had invented the mobile - a term first coined by Marcel Duchamp to describe Calder's motorised works. After 1932, Calder worked mainly on suspended sculptures that moved without motors, animated by air currents. Asked about air currents within Tate Modern, Borchardt-Hume told the BBC: \"There should be enough visitor flow to keep them moving gently.\" The gallery's air conditioning may also help, but visitors won't be able to touch the mobiles to set them in motion. \"It'll be a bit like watching the clouds drifting across the sky,\" added curator Ann Coxon. \"These sculptures really invite you to slow down. The movement is going to be subtle and drifting.\" The largest work on display will be Calder's Black Widow (1948), which is being shown for the first time outside Brazil.

Security company Symantec also believes a hacking group linked to North Korea was behind the attack. But North Korea's involvement has been disputed by other security firms. Cashing out Wannacry victims included more than 60 NHS trusts in the UK as well as Fedex, Renault and Telefonica. Those hit by the worm were asked to pay a ransom to have their data restored. The newspaper said the NSA report claims that the worm was created by a hacker group \"sponsored\" by North Korea's spy agency - the Reconnaissance General Bureau. The assessment chimes with conclusions drawn by Symantec which said it was put together by the Lazarus hacker group working on behalf of the regime. The Washington Post said the evidence gathered in the report was \"not conclusive\" but strongly suggested North Korea's involvement. However, in late May, intelligence company Flashpoint said its analysis suggested hackers fluent in Chinese were responsible. In addition, James Scott, a senior fellow at the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, has thrown doubt on links between Lazarus and Pyongyang. Attempts to tie the two together were \"premature and inconclusive\", he wrote. As a money-making scheme the outbreak failed as, so far, none of the $140,000 (\u00a3110,000) in bitcoins raised in ransom payments by victims has been withdrawn. Security experts believed this is because the transactions will be easy to track, putting law enforcement on the trail of the worm's creators. If North Korea was involved in the Wannacry outbreak and other hacking attempts, then it could be the signal that the nation is gearing up for more attacks, John Hultquist, a computer security researcher at FireEye told Reuters. \"It suggests they are preparing for something fairly significant,\" he added.\n\nSummary:","149":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Veterans, war widows and members of their families gathered for a memorial event in central London marking the 70th anniversary of VJ Day. Train passengers on Saturday paid standard charges - up to 60% more than the promotional fare available during other summer weekends. Tony Hayes, of Veterans' Association UK, said: \"They should have had a discount or kept the normal discount. It's an opportunity to make extra cash. \"They've hit the wrong people - these guys are on a pension and couldn't really afford it.\" The train firm said its summer promotion had been launched on 13 July, with some days excluded in advance. A spokesman said: \"It would have been irresponsible of us to encourage even more people on to our network on a day when we knew that trains would be extremely busy. \"We believe it makes more sense to encourage people to take advantage of our offers at slightly less busy times when they will be able to enjoy the experience more.\" Other large scale events in the region included the England v France rugby international at Twickenham, which attracted 60,000 fans.

The jury was told Mr Uppal and Mr Singh met in a barbershop to discuss ways of killing Ms Kaur, which included staging a robbery. Mr Uppal, 27, told the court the plan had been to carry out the killing with \"a big knife, like a sword\". He said the concrete company boss, who has two children from his first wife, told him: \"I want to have my wife done\". Mr Uppal told the jury: \"He did say he wanted to marry again and he said that he had found someone. He said, 'she's my girlfriend and she's a student'.\" Answering questions about the money offered, Mr Uppal said: \"He was supposed to pay me \u00a310,000 once his wife was murdered and \u00a310,000 he would arrange to send to India\". A \u00a32,000 advance payment was spent on \"an iPhone and some clothes\" but \"there was no intention to carry out any murder\", he said.

The \u00a3448m scheme was launched by Prime Minister David Cameron following the 2011 riots in various English cities. The government defines troubled families as those facing multiple problems including unemployment, anti-social behaviour and truancy. One estimate is that each troubled family costs taxpayers \u00a375,000 a year. Under the Troubled Families programme, councils are paid up to \u00a34,000 for each family they get off the \"troubled\" list, often by giving them intensive, targeted support with all aspects of life. The government says that authorities are now working with 62,000 families - half the overall target - 18 months into the programme, which ends in 2015. 'Great strides' Ministers say 22,000 families have been turned around with children in school, youth crime and anti-social behaviour significantly reduced and more than 1,400 adults in continuous work. The Department for Communities and Local Government said Wakefield had turned around more than half of its 930 troubled families and Leicestershire almost half of its 810. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the results so far showed that councils were making \"great strides\". \"I am delighted that our programme is already helping half of our target of 120,000 troubled families at its mid way stage,\" he said. \"Councils are making great strides in a very short space of time, dealing with families that have often had problems and created serious issues in their communities for generations. \"These results show that these problems can be dealt with through a no-nonsense and common-sense approach, bringing down costs to the taxpayer at the same time.\" Louise Casey, head of the Troubled Families programme, said: \"This programme is getting to grips with families who for too long have been allowed to be caught up in a cycle of despair. \"These results show that a tough, intensive but supportive approach has a big imp\n\nSummary:","155":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Duff & Phelps asked Mr Whyte to lie because they were afraid HMRC would remove them as administrators over a potential conflict of interest. The revelations are contained in a recorded conversation between the firm's David Grier and Craig Whyte. The Ticketus deal - which saw three years of Rangers season tickets sold to London finance firm Ticketus for \u00a325m - was uncovered eight months after the Motherwell-born businessman bought the club. Mr Whyte used the money to pay off Rangers' \u00a318m debt to Lloyds Banking Group. The revelation caused anger among Rangers fans, who accused Mr Whyte of lying about how he funded his purchase last May. In February 2012, when Rangers went into administration and Duff & Phelps took over, the firm described the Ticketus deal as \"a matter which we are looking at and trying to understand\". As well as being appointed administrators after the club plunged into insolvency, Duff & Phelps were also involved in Craig Whyte's takeover. And a BBC Scotland investigation broadcast in May suggested that Mr Grier, a senior Duff & Phelps partner, may have known about the controversial Ticketus deal before the Whyte takeover was complete. Mr Grier, and Duff & Phelps, denied the claims and said he was unaware of this particular Ticketus deal until August 2011. The recorded meeting between Mr Whyte and Mr Grier was held a week after the BBC documentary was aired. It revealed that Mr Grier not only knew that Mr Whyte had sold season tickets to fund the club's acquisition, but that they were intent on denying this because they thought they could get away with it. It also showed an attempt was made by Mr Grier to get Mr Whyte to agree to the publication of a press release which would vindicate the firm of any knowledge about the Ticketus deal used to buy the club.

But Mr Muscat said the UK and EU needed to first reach agreement on a range of other details once Mrs May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

The competition - run by the Woodland Trust - celebrates the country's best loved trees from historic giants to those with a special local story to tell. The much-loved Big Tree was nominated by members of the public. It is a well-known and much-loved landmark in Kirkwall, used as a meeting place by generations of Orcadians. Some might argue it owes its existence to Napoleon. During the Napoleonic wars international trade collapsed and the kelp industry boomed in Orkney, producing ash to be made into soap and glass. A number of Orcadians became very wealthy and built grand houses at Kirkwall. One of these houses had a walled garden in which three sycamore trees were planted. In the 1870s, a new owner felled two of the trees causing a public outcry that saved the third. As Kirkwall grew the Big Tree eventually found itself in a street rather than a garden. In the late 20th Century a public outcry once again saved it when the local authority planned to remove it.

It was used for events and conferences after the council bought it in 1986, but the council said it cannot afford to invest in the now-vacant building. The Sir Joseph Banks Society and several organisations are considering working together to buy and run it. It said it had had a lot of interest from various parties, including the city's universities. Paul Scott, honorary secretary of the society, said: \"It's a massive asset for the city and we would also like to see it become the third piece in the jigsaw of uphill Lincoln and all the tourism that area generates.\" The grounds contain the Sir Joseph Banks Conservatory, which is why the Sir Joseph Banks Society became involved. It is looking at how The Lawn could be developed for greater community, tourism and commercial use, including possibly creating an open air auditorium. The council tried to sell it two years ago to save money but turned down the only bid it received. Andrew Taylor, the council's chief executive, said there was a \"lack of synergy\" between the bidder and the council's vision for the site. A petition has been set up to stop the sale of The Lawn for a second time, calling on the council to develop the property into a tourist venue itself. Petition founder Phil Gresham said it was currently underused. \"It's a good heritage area that could be developed and it could be earning money for Lincoln,\" he said. A council spokesman said the petition would be debated by the full council if it reached 900 signatures before it closed on 5 September. \"If it reaches 450 signatures then a request can be made that a relevant senior officer gives evidence at a Policy Scrutiny Committee meeting,\" the spokesman said.\n\nSummary:","159":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

One expert told the BBC he had warned Tesco about other serious issues which he has not made public because of their sensitive nature. Tesco said its security was \"robust\". \"We know how important internet security is to customers and the measures we have are robust,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are never complacent and work continuously to give customers the confidence they can shop securely.\" There is no evidence to suggest Tesco has been targeted by hackers, nor that customers' personal data is at risk. Cryptographic storage Troy Hunt, a security expert who revealed details of the flaws on his blog, told the BBC he believed the Tesco website was breaking some fundamental data storage rules. \"When a website stores passwords, how they're protected in the database is important,\" he explained. \"If that database is breached, the only thing saving someone's credentials is the way they're protected in storage. What should have happen is that there should be some form of cryptographic storage - not in plain text.\" Mr Hunt pointed out that as Tesco was able to email users their password in plain text, this showed the data was not being stored cryptographically. A more secure method of password recovery is for websites to email users instructions on how to reset their password, rather than revealing the password itself. Security expert Graham Cluley echoed Mr Hunt's concerns. \"It does appear as though Tesco didn't really follow industry best practice with their site. \"That's not to say that people's detail are at risk or that they're in danger of being hacked - but it's surprising to see how Tesco has designed its site with regards to how it stores its passwords.\" 'Full review' Mr Hunt also criticised Tesco for not using HTTPS - Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure - across its entire site.

Last Wednesday they hunkered down in secure rooms, seeking refuge from an invasion of Congress in which five people died. Some Republicans were not wearing masks during the ordeal, footage suggests. Video shared by Punchbowl News shows several lawmakers apparently refusing facemasks offered to them. However, CBS pictures from inside the chamber show Ms Jayapal was herself not wearing a mask at one point. Medical experts fear more lawmakers may have contracted the disease, potentially amounting to a super-spreader event at a time when coronavirus infections and deaths continue to rise in the US. The US has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections (22.6 million) and deaths (367,000) in the world, with no sign of the epidemic abating, despite the limited roll-out of vaccines. Over the weekend, top congressional doctor Brian Monahan told lawmakers and congressional staff who sheltered together from the riots to get tested. \"The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others,\" Mr Monahan said. \"During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection.\" Mr Monahan did not say how many lawmakers were in the room, but called on them to observe social-distancing measures and wear masks. New Jersey Democratic Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman was the first lawmaker to confirm she had tested positive on Monday. In a tweet, the 75-year-old cancer survivor said she was resting at home with \"mild, cold-like symptoms\". Ms Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, and Illinois congressman Mr Schneider revealed they had tested positive on Tuesday.

Adapted from Alberto Moravia's 1951 novel, it addressed Italy's fascist history with a plot revolving around a member of the secret police who is tasked with assassinating his anti-fascist former professor, who's in exile in Paris. It was lauded for its eerie, operatic imagery, which is credited for influencing The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II. Francis Ford Coppola even recruited Bertolucci's cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro, for 1979's Apocalypse Now. The Conformist earned Bertolucci his first Oscar nomination - for best adapted screenplay rather than best director. Last Tango in Paris (1972) Two years later, Bertolucci was nominated for best director for Last Tango in Paris, and Marlon Brando was nominated for best actor, a year after he'd won for The Godfather. Brando plays Paul, an American in Paris, who deals with his wife's suicide by shacking up with Jeanne (Maria Schneider) in an empty apartment. His anguished monologue over the body of his wife was \"perhaps the best acting he has ever done\", critic Roger Ebert declared. But the dark, torrid story about love and grief shocked as soon as it was released, and the film was banned in Italy for a brutal, now-notorious sex scene involving butter. The director sparked criticism years later by saying he had come up with the idea for the butter scene with Brando that morning without telling Schneider because he \"wanted her reaction as a girl, not as an actress\". In a 2007 interview, Schneider said she that although the scene was simulated, she had felt \"humiliated\" and \"a little raped, both by Marlon and by Bertolucci.\" The Last Emperor (1987) This epic tale of Pu Yi, who became emperor of China at the age of three, was Bertolucci's critical and commercial pinnacle. Pu Yi was dethroned at six but \n\nSummary:","163":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Danny Warby, 28, of Runcton Holme, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, had opened a text message moments before his 13.6-tonne vehicle hit the officer's car. Warby had denied causing Mrs Garrett's death by dangerous driving but was convicted by a jury last month. More on this and other news from Cambridgeshire and Norfolk He was also banned from driving for 10 years. During a nine-day trial, Peterborough Crown Court heard Warby had opened a text message one minute and six seconds before the crash. His vehicle crossed the white line in the centre of the road and clipped an oncoming lorry, showering two cars in debris, before crashing into Mrs Garrett's Renault Clio, which was in the oncoming line of traffic. Warby was driving at 53mph (85km\/h) on a stretch of single carriageway restricted to 40mph (64km\/h) for lorries at the time of the collision, the prosecution said. The court heard the delivery firm driver had numerous previous convictions including speeding and using a mobile phone while driving. In 2015, Warby was banned for a year for drink-driving. Mother of two Mrs Garrett was married to a fellow police officer and was on her way home from work at the time of the crash on 6 June. Her car crashed off the road and ended up in a field and she was pronounced dead at the scene. Sentencing Warby to six years in prison, His Honour Judge Stuart Bridge told him it was clear he had not learned anything from his previous court appearances. \"Your driving in general was reckless and cavalier, and on this day it was deplorable,\" he said. \"Mrs Garrett and her family have paid the ultimate price.\" Mrs Garrett joined Cambridgeshire Police in 1991 and served in a number of roles across the force, most recently investigating complex fraud offences in the Economic Crime Unit.

On Tuesday, the main Shanghai Composite index closed down 7.6% at 2,964.97 points, extending Monday's losses. Stock markets in Lisbon, Madrid and Milan, all also made strong gains. But Wall Street bucked the trend. Having initially surged all three main stock indexes in the US reversed sharply in the final hour of trading.

President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was not at the palace at the time. The al-Qaeda-aligned al-Shabab group lost control of Mogadishu in 2011, but often carries out attacks in the city. The group has vowed to step up attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. On Saturday, a suicide car bomb exploded near the capital's parliament building, killing at least four people. The BBC's Mohammed Moalimu in Mogadishu says President Mohamud was attending a function at the residence of the UN special envoy to Somalia, near the airport. A large contingent of the Somali military police accompanied him, leaving the presidential palace, known as Villa Somalia, mainly under the protection of African Union soldiers, he says. The presidential palace is the seat of government and many top government officials live and work there. It is not clear if the prime minister and speaker of parliament were in the compound when it was attacked. \"We have entered the so-called presidential palace.

Prosecutor Paul Lewis said the men had been involved in \"an altercation\" the night before, adding: \"Both attacked Mr Clark. \"But it was Steven Baxter who then inflicted the fatal wound upon him during the attack.\" Jurors were told the victim's body was found by a friend in the doorway of his caravan the following day after he had been stabbed in the chest with a knife.

Boss and executive chairman of Victoria's Secret, Leslie Wexner, will step down as part of the deal. He said that separating Victoria's Secret into a private company would \"restore\" the business's growth. The lingerie company accounted for nearly half of the company's $13.2bn revenue in 2019. But it has seen sales decline over the last year. L Brands valued the firm at $1.1bn and will retain a 45% stake. After selling several businesses, L Brands said it will concentrate on the beauty chain it owns, Bath & Body Works. Mr Wexner has been appointed chairman emeritus and will remain a member of the board. In 2019, he came under fire for his long friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Wexner employed Epstein as a close adviser, but cut ties in 2007. He said he was \"embarrassed\" by his friendship with the US financier. He also previously accused Epstein of misappropriating money. The brand faced further scrutiny last year as it cancelled its annual fashion show, citing poor television ratings. The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year to watch its so-called \"angels\". In 2018 it saw its lowest ratings ever, drawing criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity. The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to \"evolve\" its marketing strategy at the time.

MPs are to vote on legalising same sex weddings, on Tuesday, but a number of Tory MPs are likely to oppose the bill. Conservative activists have signed letters voicing both opposition to, and support for, the move. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill would enable same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies, where a religious institution had formally consented, in England and Wales. It would also allow couples who had previously entered into civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage. 'No good reason' The plans have been strongly backed by Prime Minister David Cameron, but he is facing significant opposition from within his own party. Reports suggest upwards of 120 Tory MPs could vote against the plans, including some cabinet ministers. MPs will have a free vote on the issue, meaning they will not be issued orders by party whips, but the measure is expected to get through, with most on the Labour and Lib Dem benches supporting it. Maria Miller, who is leading the bill through Parliament, defended the proposals, saying marriage as an institution had always evolved and would continue to do so. \"The proposals for change are straightforward - if a couple love each other, then the state should not stop them getting married unless there is good reason - and being gay is not reason enough,\" she said. \"This bill is about choice. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who don't agree.\" On Sunday, more than 20 current and former constituency chairmen delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street urging the prime minister to delay any parliamentary decision on gay marriage until after the next election.

In the Burmese context, \"easy\" means decisions that don't upset the army. Political prisoners were released, censorship of newspapers and the internet lifted and a (flawed) law passed allowing public demonstrations. In a short period of time, one of the world's most tightly controlled societies opened up in a way few had thought possible. Stories critical of ministers were suddenly on the front page of private newspapers, and demonstrations, mostly connected to land rights, have become almost daily events. But the early pace of those changes hasn't been sustained. There was no way it could. 'Disciplined democracy' So did the reformers run out of steam? Did Thein Sein's project reach a roadblock manned by hardliners in the Burmese army? Or perhaps we're close to the final destination - that is, with sanctions lifted and the army still really in charge. Ms Suu Kyi's main frustration is that the constitution remains unchanged. Drafted in 2008, it entrenches the military's control of political life, guaranteeing it a quarter of the seats in the Hluttaw (the Burmese parliament), and a veto over any changes to the constitution. This is what its architects proudly call a \"disciplined democracy\". The opposition have focused on the two parts they want changed most. They are: the clause barring anyone who has foreign family members from becoming president, which effectively prevents Ms Suu Kyi from taking power (because of her British sons) and Article 436, which gives the army a ve\n\nSummary:","178":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The rate of avoidable deaths is also far higher for men than women in Wales. The figures include deaths caused by drug and alcohol abuse, accidental deaths and suicides. They also include murders, some infectious diseases, such as HIV and TB, and preventable or treatable health conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease and asthma. Complacency The rate of avoidable deaths has fallen steadily in Wales over the 11 years for which figures are available, but the rate has fallen faster in England. In 2012, the ONS said there were 7,486 avoidable deaths in Wales at an estimated rate of 193.5 per 100,000 of the population. This compares to a rate of 168.1 per 100,000 of the population in England. The figures have been adjusted for the age of the population. In 2001 there were 9,037 avoidable deaths in Wales and the rate was 264.4 per 100,000 residents. The data shows that the avoidable rate for men in 2012 was 240 per 100,000 residents, compared to 148.9 women. The new ONS figures follow a review by the Royal College of Physicians which found that people suffering from asthma are dying unnecessarily because of complacency among both medical staff and patients. The first national study of asthma deaths in the UK, which was published on Tuesday, said 67 people died from the condition in Wales in 2012-13 and 3,571 were hospitalised.\n\nSummary:","179":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Arts Council England ruled the sale breached the accredited standards for how museums manage their collections. The council is now ineligible for a range of arts grants and funding. Scott Furlong, from the Arts Council, said: \"It is always hugely regrettable when we have to exclude a museum from the Accreditation Scheme. \"However, it is equally important that we are robust in upholding the standards and principles which underpin the scheme and are shared by the vast majority of museums.\" Northampton Museum and Art Gallery, which is set to benefit from the sale of the statue, and the council-run Abington Park Museum have been removed from the Accreditation Scheme with immediate effect and excluded from future participation until at least August 2019. The scheme sets nationally agreed standards for museums in the UK, demonstrating their commitment to managing collections effectively for the enjoyment and benefit of users. It also has strict criteria for the disposal of cultural objects. David Mackintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said the news was \"disappointing\" and \"puzzling\" as it is one of the only local authorities in the country with multi-million pound investment plans in the museum service. The statue of Sekhemka, court official and priest, was sold at Christie's of London during an auction in July amid protests from the Save Sekhemka Action Group, who said it was the \"darkest cultural day in [Northampton's] history\". Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as an \"an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology\".

The spokesman added: \"Signs warning people not to trespass on railway property are in place for your safety - not for your inconvenience - and they must be adhered to.\" The bridge was badly damaged by fire in 1970. It reopened to rail traffic in 1972, and the road was opened in 1980. BTP said they were not aware of people trespassing on other prominent sites in Wales to take photographs.

Nottingham City Council believed it had the answer. But its series of hard-hitting posters telling the public not to hand over their cash to beggars have since been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority. The ASA said the posters, which claimed money given to beggars would be used on drugs, alcohol and fraud, reinforced \"negative stereotypes\" and were likely to cause offence. New figures released on Wednesday showed homelessness in England has risen to its highest level for nearly 10 years. A total of 15,170 households were classed as homeless in the three months to June 2016 - a jump of 10% on the same period last year, according to figures from Department for Communities and Local Government. With more people suffering from homelessness, the general public may feel they wish to give cash to those sleeping rough. But London-based homeless charity Thames Reach said handing over money to beggars \"can have fatal consequences\". Its outreach teams estimate 80% of people begging in the capital do so to support a drug habit which is often an addiction to substances including crack cocaine and heroin. Communications manager Mike Nicholas said: \"Most people begging are not individuals in temporary difficulties, but people who are dependent on a begging income. \"This is almost certainly to fund a serious drug habit. There is no need to beg on the streets in 2016. \"As an organisation that has worked with people on the street since 1984, we have seen many lives damaged by hard drugs and alcohol misuse. \"We have even lost people through overdoses in situations where a significant portion of the money they spent on drugs came from members of the public giving loose change \"Giving to people who beg is not a benign ac\n\nSummary:","183":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Out of 200 vaccine-hesitant patients called by one practice, 125 decided to go ahead with the jab after discussing their concerns with a doctor. One GP involved in the project said it was \"clear\" the approach worked. Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) devised the approach after finding vaccine uptake was up to 40% lower among residents from deprived areas and BAME communities. 'Trust' Prof Azhar Farooqi, chair of the CCG and a GP, said: \"It's a big concern to us because often these communities are the most affected by Covid. \"We're finding the reasons why people are hesitating are very personal. \"It may be around worry about medicines they're already taking, or their pre-existing conditions, or it might be they're not satisfied with the outcome data, or they just want to wait and see what happens with the vaccine. \"The advantage of a one-to-one conversation is you can address these concerns very specifically and, by-and-large, most people in this country trust their GP. \"The information they get, they are often prepared to accept because they know their medical history as well.\" Leicester currently has a seven-day coronavirus infection rate of 217.1 cases per 100,000 people - above the national average and the second highest in England. In June, it became the first area in England to be made subject to a local lockdown. Prof Farooqi said while the pilot scheme was getting results, more support would be needed to make it sustainable. \"Clearly it's very time-intensive.

The High Court heard the regime broke their right to liberty and privacy. The West Sussex centre has been under scrutiny since the BBC's Panorama filmed undercover in 2017. The three men claim that the \"lock-in regime\" at Brook House - with detainees confined to their rooms between 21:00 and 08:00 every day, which the Home Office refers to as \"the night state\" - breached their right to liberty and privacy. They claim the regime subjected them to \"an unlawful, discriminatory and\/or disproportionate interference\" with practising Muslims' right to religious freedom as they had to pray in their cells. Opening the claimants' case Stephanie Harrison QC said: \"From its outset, Brook House has operated and continues to operate the most restrictive regime, based on a category B prison, of prolonged and multiple lock-ins which significantly curtail and restrict the residual liberties and freedoms of administrative detainees.\" She said the Home Office had \"in effect surrendered and\/or abdicated its responsibilities to set the minimum standards and conditions required.\" Thomas Roe QC, for the Home Office, said in written submissions \"all immigration removal centres have a 'night state\"'. He said the Home Office's contract with G4S meant the Secretary of State could \"alter the hours of the night state if she so wished.\" He told the court: \"While it is true that Brook House is a secure environment and was built to Prison Service category B standard, it does not follow that detention there is like incarceration as a prisoner at a category B prison.\" Mr Justice Cavanagh, who will hear the case over three days, is expected to reserve his judgment.

Some traders said it was affecting them as people had to walk an extra 330 yards (300m) to get to the main shops. The town council said it would review the success of the scheme in August. Buses used to stop at the Market Place, but they now have to stop outside the King's Head pub. The East Suffolk Travellers Association (Esta) said it carried out a survey which showed nearly 80% of people did not like the new arrangement.

Three hundred men are taking part in the trials, from three London GP surgeries. Developing better diagnostic tests that could be used as part of a nationwide screening programme is a research priority for prostate cancer. At present, there is no single, reliable test for prostate cancer. The PSA blood test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used. But the PSA can give false positives and sometimes misses more aggressive cases. The new DNA test was created by a group of international scientists based at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London. They studied more than 140,000 men and identified 63 new genetic variations that can increase the risk of prostate cancer. The DNA test combines those variants with more than 100 others previously linked to prostate cancer. Ros Eeles, professor of oncogenetics at the ICR, said the study was \"very significant\". \"By looking at the DNA code of tens of thousands of men in more depth than ever before, we have uncovered vital new information about the genetic factors that can predispose someone to prostate cancer, and, crucially, we have shown that information from more than 150 genetic variants can now be combined to provide a readout of a man's inherited risk of prostate cancer.\" Only those men found to be at higher risk of prostate cancer would then be scanned and have a prostate biopsy, so researchers hope it could prevent unnecessary procedures. \"It could have a substantial impact on how we actually manage those at increased risk because if you find the disease earlier it's much easier to treat it and much more easy to cure,\" says Prof Elees. The trial will be expanded to 5,000 men next year.

The margin between the two has narrowed to within 0.5% of each other. Florida's gubernatorial race between Democrat Andrew Gillum and Republican Ron DeSantis could also face a recount. On Tuesday night, Mr Scott announced his victory - and was even congratulated via phone by President Donald Trump - but Mr Nelson did not make a concession speech at the time. The next morning, Mr Nelson, who has served 18 years as senator, said in a statement: \"We are proceeding to a recount.\" The Scott camp responded by calling the Democrat's reticence to concede \"a sad way for Bill Nelson to end his career\", NBC News reported. But now that the margin between them has narrowed to nearly 22,000 votes as of Thursday, Florida State Law mandates a statewide recount. The Florida senate campaigns were one of the most expensive this election season, with over $96m (\u00a373m) spent in total. Reaction over the senate race has drawn immediate comparisons to Florida's 2000 presidential election recount dispute that allowed Republican George W Bush to win the presidency. The governor's race may also face a recount. On Thursday morning, Mr Gillum's team walked back his earlier concession to Republican Mr DeSantis. \"It has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported,\" his campaign said in a statement, noting they are ready for a state-mandated recount.

Written exams for GCSE, AS and A-Level had already been cancelled. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said work was taking place to find an alternative way to award grades and qualifications. She said the safety of students was \"paramount\" in the decision to cancel exams. \u201cMost vocational qualifications are offered across the UK and therefore my department is working as a matter of urgency with the Department of Education, CCEA and other regulators, awarding organisations and governments across the UK to identify the fairest way to issue grades to learners who are studying qualifications other than GCSEs and A-Levels,\" she said. \u201cI will provide more details about these arrangements at the earliest possible opportunity.\u201d Range of courses There were 76,670 students across Northern Ireland's six further education colleges in 2018\/19, the majority of whom take courses on a part-time basis. Finding an alternative and fair way to award qualifications is likely to be difficult due to the wide range of vocational qualifications and awarding bodies.

It has been a tough week for Volkswagen. It has been fined $4.3bn, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges - and six executives are facing charges. One of them, Oliver Schmidt, has spent the past few days in a Miami jail. Others may yet find themselves in the firing line. But because of this, we now have a very clear idea not only of what Volkswagen was doing wrong, and how it went about it, but also the measures that were taken to conceal that wrongdoing. As part of its plea bargain with the US authorities Volkswagen signed up to an agreed \"Statement of Facts\". It draws heavily on the results of an investigation by the law firm Jones Day, commissioned by VW itself. The FBI makes further detailed allegations in its criminal complaint against Oliver Schmidt. These have not yet been tested or admitted. 'Defeat device' According to these documents, the seeds of the scandal were sown in 2006, when VW were designing a new diesel engine for the US market. Supervisors in the engine department realised they had a problem. They could not design an engine that would meet tough emissions standards due to enter into force in 2007, and at the same time give customers the performance that they wanted. Their solution was to ask their engineers to design engine management software which would turn on emissions controls when the car was being tested, and turn them off when it was being driven on the road. This 'defeat device' software was able to recognise the standard testing procedure. It was based on a program developed by VW's subsidiary Audi, which engineers had specifically stated should \"absolutely not be used\" in the US. Not everyone was happy about this, it seems.

And 1949 was also the last time the principal rooms of Buckingham Palace were re-decorated. The central London building, which had suffered nine direct hits during World War Two, was in need of a spruce-up. According to the monarchy's website, \"very few changes\" had happened to it during George VI's reign, from 1936 to 1952. The 19 state rooms remain remarkably intact 66 years after the last significant work. Pictures show the White Drawing Room, often used for photographic portraits of the Royal Family, looking in a very similar state in 1947, 1993 and 2011. \"Most people decorate their houses, mainly for fashion reasons, every 10 years or so,\" says historian Ellen Leslie, \"but this isn't what the Royal Family are into when it comes to Buckingham Palace. They want it to keep looking the same.\" Leslie, who last visited the palace in 2012, says the decor, which she describes as a mixture of \"neoclassical and empire\", looked \"fine\" at the time. The state rooms are finished in elaborate style. The Blue Drawing Room features blue flock wallpaper and columns painted to resemble the stone onyx. The Throne Room, its interior designed by John Nash, features a plaster frieze showing scenes from the Wars of the Roses. Only routine touching-up has occurred during the reign of Elizabeth II, which began in 1952. \"But it wasn't designed to be low-maintenance,\" says Leslie. \"There's lots of white paintwork to keep clean. The reason it's lasted so well is that it was furnished and decorated to a very high standard in the first place. \"A lot of the interior is based on the inspirations of Edward VII, who loved the place.

The research looked at public services that are already available online and found many were not user-friendly. It also found that while only a few services are delivered primarily online, such as self-assessment taxation by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and driving licensing and vehicle road tax by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, there is a move towards introducing more services in the next few years.

Mr Walker, from Wellow in Nottinghamshire, offered to show police online evidence proving he had paid, but was told it was a \"DVLA matter\". The DVLA accepted there had been a mistake but said these are \"rare\". Mr Walker said he felt \"humiliated\" to have police tow his vehicle away in front of his neighbours on Saturday. The handbrake of his van was damaged and he had to take two days off work to sort the problem out. \"There's something wrong with the system because you're not actually physically getting anything to say the tax is paid,\" he said. \"For the sake of the price of a stamp and a little bit of administration they could actually send something through the post to say that you've paid.\" Tax discs were abolished last October to try to save printing and administration costs. Motorists can continue to tax their vehicle at the Post Office, over the phone or online. However, they do not receive a tax disc or any other physical evidence to put in their car windscreen.

Earlier this month the Polish treasury ministry announced it had completed work on a compensation bill but it would not be sent to parliament because it would add a huge 18bn zloty (\u00a34bn; $6.3bn) to the public debt. Poland's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, said the decision would be reconsidered when Poland's financial situation improved. Justice delayed Stuart Eizenstat, the US state department's special adviser on the Holocaust, said the US was \"deeply disappointed\" by the announcement. Nazi Germany exterminated about 90% of Poland's pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million in World War II. The victims were stripped of their property, meaning there are now many claims from relatives. But the Jewish claims only account for about 17% of the total. Most relate to Poles who lost property confiscated after the war by the communist regime. The Polish Union of Property Owners estimates there are about one million claimants and the total value of compensation owing is 95bn zloty. Ronald Lauder, President of the World Jewish Congress (WJC), said Poland was \"telling many elderly pre-war landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them\". This criticism led Poland's Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski, to say that the US had given up its right to represent its citizens in such cases under a compensation agreement from the 1960s. He added that \"a good moment\" for the US to have helped Polish Jews was in 1943-44.

Carwyn Jones and Nicola Sturgeon have now written to the House of Lords calling for changes to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. They claim powers held back include areas of \"vital importance\" to them. The EU (Withdrawal) Bill - currently being examined in detail at committee stage in the Lords - aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them. As the bill currently stands, powers in devolved areas that are currently wielded at EU level - such as support for farmers - are set to return to Westminster rather than Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. Last week UK ministers announced the list of powers that they would retain at a UK level, for a temporary period, including food labelling and chemicals regulation. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said at the time that the \"vast majority\" of Brussels powers in 158 devolved policy areas would be in the control of Wales and Scotland \"on the day we leave the EU\". But he added: \"There is a much smaller group of powers where the devolved governments will be required to follow current EU laws for a little bit longer while we work out a new UK approach.\" In the letter to peers, Mr Jones and Ms Sturgeon said these covered areas of \"vital importance\" for the industries and economies of Wales and Scotland. They said they agreed \"common frameworks\" for UK-wide policies were \"appropriate in some cases\" but rejected the idea of letting UK ministers set them up without approval from Cardiff Bay and Holyrood. \"The devolved legislatures would be asked to agree to the creation of this power with no certainty about where frameworks will be established, how these will work, how they will be governed and how we will go from temporary restrictions to longer term solutions,\" the first ministers said.

Katie Kardosova, who runs Combo, has not qualified for financial support. The Scottish government said it was listening to concerns, and had introduced a \u00a3100m grant fund to help. Because of the way in which she pays her business rates, the Combo owner found herself unable to get financial help from the government scheme, and she fears her business may not survive. Like other traders at the market, she pays a flat fee to the market operators, which includes her business rates. She therefore does not appear as the liable ratepayer, so does not qualify for the Covid-19 business support grant. Financial survival over just the next few months has now become the focus. Ms Kardosova said: \"My cafe was for normal working people on a moderate income and also for pensioners. \"Once everything is eased, people are going to be kind of scared to go out and to be able to survive. We need some kind of support.\" She explained: \"I've got a VAT bill to pay, I've got my first tax bill to pay, and because we are not able to make money then that's not good at all.\" Aberdeen Donside MSP Mark McDonald said it appeared there were gaps in the safety net, and more needed to be done to ensure businesses did not fall through.

His body was found next to a shotgun, hours after he told his GP his marriage was breaking down and he was depressed. He was the uncle of \"Lotto lout\" Michael Carroll, who hit the headlines in 2002 and later blew his fortune. An earlier hearing concluded Mrs Muncaster was unlawfully killed, and the Norwich coroner ruled that Mr Muncaster's death was suicide. 'Head in his hands' His GP Chris Holmes said in a written statement: \"He came to see me complaining he was feeling depressed. \"His wife had told him she was leaving him and he suspected she was seeing someone else.\" But Dr Holmes added he was confident he had no intention of harming himself or others because he loved his grandchildren. The shooting of Mrs Muncaster was captured on CCTV cameras within the house. Det Con Jeremy Pitt from Norfolk Police said the footage showed Mr Muncaster looking \"very upset with his head in his hands\". There had been no previous domestic incidents reported to police and Mr Muncaster was a licensed shotgun owner. A post-mortem examination concluded he died of a single shotgun wound to the head. The builder had appeared on national TV alongside his nephew, Michael Carroll, when the 19-year-old won \u00a39.7m on the National Lottery in 2002.

Employment also continued to rise, with a stronger performance reported among service industries than the manufacturing sector. However, food, fuel and labour costs all rose during the month. September's rise in new business - the 10th in successive months - was supported by further growth in new export orders for manufacturers. A strong housing market was another factor driving the upturn, according to survey respondents. The PMI monitor for September recorded sharp increases in business activity in the services sector, with the most marked pace of growth being seen in travel, tourism and leisure. Jobs growth The increase in activity built on solid jobs growth observed at services firms during August. September's survey also pointed to a \"sharp and accelerated increase\" in new business at Scottish service providers. There was a further slowdown in the rate of growth of manufacturing output north of the border, but it remained \"at a level consistent with a solid pace of expansion overall\". Scottish manufacturers hired more staff during the month, continuing a trend observed in each month since February. New order intakes rose for the ninth successive month in September, but the rate of growth eased sharply from the marked pace observed in July and August. Export sales Goods producers north of the border also registered improved export sales in September. Meanwhile, higher food, fuel and labour costs helped to lift input price inflation to well above the UK average. However, the survey found businesses largely refrained from passing on increased costs to clients.

It added that in many cases people were included for raising legitimate concerns over health and safety issues. The list was drawn up by The Consulting Association (TCA). The organisation was closed down in 2009 after being raided by the Information Commissioner's Office. Unions are seeking compensation, arguing that those on the blacklist were denied work. The MPs said some of the biggest names in construction as well as many smaller firms had been involved. In an interim report, the committee said: \"The organisation set up to create, maintain and operate the blacklist - The Consulting Association (TCA) - appears to have been largely established by Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, which also provided TCA's chairmen for eight of its 16 years of operation. \"Other major subscribers included Skanska and Balfour Beatty.\" Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, whose director Cullum McAlpine appeared before the committee, responded to the report by denying it had ever operated a blacklist. 'Morally indefensible' The MPs said that while the blacklist was not initially illegal, it was always \"morally indefensible\", and the companies involved continued to use it after it had become illegal. The MPs found companies set up a structure through TCA which allowed them to submit names and information on workers they deemed to be unsuitable to a central list and to check prospective employees against that list. \"The emphasis throughout was on secrecy, with telephone access to sensitive information restricted to only a few, with the lists of names submitted destroyed at the end of each working day and no acknowledgement that such a system existed,\" the MPs said.

Women and equalities minister Nicky Morgan said the move was a \"first step\" but would \"concentrate minds\". The TUC said the measures should include medium-sized businesses and come with fines for non-compliance. The Chartered Management Institute said the new legislation would \"force transparency\" on companies. The plan on bonuses is the first of a number of \"equality-boosting measures\" to be set out in detail this week and hopefully introduced in the first half of 2016, according to Downing Street. Other steps include: Details of exactly what companies must publish and when the scheme will begin will be announced after the results of a consultation, which concluded in September, are released. 'Concentrate minds' More than 10 million workers will be covered by the new transparency rules - although far fewer than that receive bonuses. The measures are contained in the Equality Act 2010, which was introduced by Labour but blocked from implementation by the Conservatives until now. Latest figures show that, overall, women in the UK earn 19% less than men. Up to the age of 40, there is very little difference between the earnings of men and women. But beyond that age, when more women are likely to have taken time out to raise families and work part-time, there is a significant gap. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said publishing salary and bonus information was a \"start\" - but employers needed to look at why women were still being paid less than men and \"do something meaningful about it\". Ms Morgan said the government was \"going further than ever before to ensure true gender equality in the workplace\".

The film will tell the true story of a Jewish boy in Italy in 1858 who is taken from his parents, raised as a Catholic and later becomes a priest. Filming will start when Spielberg finishes work on Ready Player One. That sci-fi movie starts filming this summer so The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara is expected to go into production at the start of 2017. Rylance also has to complete work in the Christopher Nolan World War Two film Dunkirk, which goes into production next month. The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara will be written by screenwriter Tony Kushner, known for his work on the Oscar-winning Lincoln. The true story of the six-year-old Mortara became an international scandal which was ultimately thought to lead to the crumbling of the structure of the Papacy, as it was at the time, and then to the unification of Italy. The boy was taken from his family home in Bologna because a servant in his household said she had baptised him as an emergency measure when he was very ill. Mortara grew up as a Catholic under the protection of Pope Pius IX, who refused to return him to his parents despite their pleas. Mortara subsequently became a priest in the Augustinian order. Rylance was formerly best known for his work in the London theatre, including in his role as artistic director of the Globe theatre. He is still active on the West End stage, notably being nominated for an Olivier award for starring as King Philippe V of Spain in Farinelli and the King. He was nominated just hours after winning his first Oscar. But Rylance has become more open to film roles in recent years and The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara will mark his third movie with Spielberg. As well as the Cold War thriller Bridge of Spies, Rylance is also playing the title character in Spielberg's The BFG, based on the best-selling children's book by Roald Dahl.

On Thursday, it opened its website freedom251.com for pre-orders with payments due in full in advance - the phone would be sold online over a five-day window. Deliveries are promised by June. The website crashed, and it put up a notice claiming overwhelming response at \"600,000 hits per second\", due to which it was pausing bookings for a day. The company's office was also swamped by thousands of potential buyers. The firm's founder, Mohit Goel, said the phone would be locally made as part of the \"Make in India\" program promoted aggressively by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. However, the prototypes shown to media were of a Chinese-made phone with its brand name, Adcom, covered with white paint. The Android-based smartphone, with a 4-inch display, looks very similar to Apple's older iPhone 4 handset, complete with a home button and icons that are nearly identical to the iPhone's. Adcom is a Delhi-based importer of technology products. Its Ikon 4 handset, available for 4,000 rupees (about $59; \u00a341) on Indian e-commerce site Flipkart, appears to be very similar in specifications to Freedom 251. However, the Hindustan Times newspaper quoted Adcom's marketing head denying any knowledge of the company being associated with the Freedom 251 handset. Experts who tried out the samples said the experience, including the 480\u00d7800 display and performance, was as expected for an entry-level phone in the $50 range: usable, not great.

Mr Stansfeld admitted he will support a 2% council tax rise next year followed by a 2.5% rise the following year. He believes the move will protect the force's long-term resources. The changes in funding will depend on approval by the police and crime panel for the Thames Valley made up of representatives from councils across the area. Mr Stansfeld, from Kintbury, West Berkshire beat Labour's Tim Starkey on Friday after second preference votes were counted up. Outlining his priorities for the job in an interview with BBC local radio, the former army officer stressed Thames Valley Police has already shown resilience in the face of stringent cuts.

Over the past three years, gangs are said to have killed more than 800 rhinos for their horns, which can fetch \u00a322,000 ($35,055) per kg on the black market. Poachers use a chainsaw to cut away the rhino's horns, after darting it with a tranquilizer - drugged and helpless the animal bleeds to death. Large syndicates are involved in this multi-billion dollar trade worldwide - exporting the horns from Africa to parts of Asia and the Middle-East. Despite many anti-poaching measures 310 have been killed in South Africa this year, more than 330 had been killed at the end of last year - and the numbers are set to increase, experts warn. In the five years up to 2005, an average of 36 rhinos were killed each year. Some say today's efforts are \"too conventional\" and are not enough. Now South Africa has commissioned a study into whether legalising trade in rhino horn could in fact help to bring down poaching, the Department of Environmental Affairs announced recently. \"We are impartial at this stage but we are looking at all the suggestions which could help us in the fight against poachers,\" the department's spokesperson, Albie Modise, told the BBC. \"We are awaiting submissions and would consider this if we get authentic scientific backing that this would be effective,\" he said. The idea is that legalising rhino horn trade would make South Africa directly responsible for meeting the demand for the horns - taking power out of the hands of poachers and placing it in the hands authorities who would also be sensitive to current conservation efforts. These authorities would do market research into global markets of the trade, said Mr Modise. The department says rhino horn stock piles could also be sold to fund further rhino conservation efforts.

Motorbikes have become increasingly popular in Addis Ababa as a way of avoiding traffic jams, but are not as common as in many other African cities. Similar bans have been in others places across Africa in a bid to end violent robberies and attacks. More than a week before the ban came in, a food delivery company, Deliver Addis, told customers that it was suspending services after the authorities seized motorbikes. On Monday another food delivery service, ZMall, which delivers food for Pizza Hut, announced that they too were no longer taking orders because of the ban.

Ms Larn - who is currently waiting for a date for a tribunal to review her case - told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) she believes the assessor who did her home visit thought she was less ill than she was. \"I'd only had one session of chemotherapy then and it was before I'd lost my hair and the steroids had taken effect which made me put weight on,\" she said. \"I can't help thinking they must have thought I looked alright so I can't have been that bad.\" Ms Larn received a letter informing her she would not be receiving PIP six weeks after the visit at her home in Braunstone, Leicestershire, and she said she called the DWP to query the results. \"The man on the phone was really good and explained things to me, I asked him 'So basically I haven't got cancer enough?' and he said yes and that I didn't have enough points to be considered,\" she said. Ms Larn is now in remission. A DWP spokesman said she would continue to receive other benefits while awaiting the outcome of her appeal. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Labour MSP Jackie Baillie said this was \"beyond belief\" and an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\". Ms Sturgeon said she did not accept Mr Salmond's account and said opposition MSPs had taken his claims \"as gospel\". The first minister said the claims of a conspiracy against her predecessor were \"deeply unfair to the women involved\" and to \"the efforts to create a culture in Scotland where women feel they can come forward with complaints\". Mr Salmond is expected to give evidence to a Holyrood inquiry into the government's handling of complaints against him on Friday, with Ms Sturgeon to follow next Wednesday. Mr Salmond has made accusations of a \"malicious and concerted\" attempt to remove him from public life, taking aim at Ms Sturgeon, her government and the party he once led, the SNP. The first minister has rejected the claims, saying there is \"not a shred of evidence\" that there was a conspiracy. At her weekly question session at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon was challenged by opposition leaders about Mr Salmond's claims and whether her government had engaged in a \"cover-up\". Ms Baillie - a member of the Holyrood inquiry committee - said the probe was at its heart about two women who had been failed by the government, after it admitted its investigation of their complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful. 'Breakdown of trust' And she said that \"astonishingly\", the name of one of the women involved had been passed to Mr Salmond while a meeting with Ms Sturgeon was being arranged. She said the identity of the woman had been revealed to Geoff Aberdein - Mr Salmond's former chief of staff - and was then conveyed on to him. Ms Baillie said this was an \"extraordinary breach of confidentiality\" and a \"fundamental breakdown of trust\".

Officials said it was due to reopen \"on target\" on Sunday at 12:00 GMT. The work is seeing the viaduct replaced by a new bridge. Engineers are dismantling the 3,500-tonne structure, which carried M6 southbound traffic over the M1. It means the M1 is shut in both directions at junction 19 and southbound traffic on the M6 is not able to join the M1 at the interchange. The agency said so far there had been minor traffic problems at the junction, up to about a 10-minute delay during peak time earlier. 'Traffic levels lower' Drivers are being urged to allow extra time for their journeys or to avoid the area if they can. Highways officials particularly warned football fans travelling for FA Cup games to find alternative ways of travelling. Ivan Marriott, from the Highways Agency, said the organisation had thought carefully about when to do the work. \"The problem is there is never going to be a weekend when nothing's actually happening,\" he said. \"Obviously we chose a weekend where traffic levels are lower. There's also less commercial traffic around as well and we did deliberately choose to avoid the busy Christmas period and also the new year. \"We've also been in contact with the FA and other organisations to try and get the message over that the closures were over this weekend.\" Full details of the closures can be found on the Highways Agency website.\n\nSummary:","216":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Underlying profit for the period was \u00a32.08bn, up 9% on 2016. The bank did not set further money aside to cover PPI claims, having made another \u00a3700m of provisions in July. The Lloyds group has already paid out more than \u00a318bn in PPI claims and received more following a Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) advertising campaign featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The FCA campaign highlighted a deadline for PPI claims of August 2019. Lloyds said it received 16,000 claims per week after the advert was broadcast, with the number then dropping back to 11,000. Should PPI rise above anticipated levels, it could pose a problem, \"but we will be managing within the group's resources and financial strength which we see today,\" chief financial officer George Culmer said during a conference call. \"Now they will be getting more claims but the end is in sight, so what they are saying is they have sufficient provision in to see it all through,\" banking analyst Frances Coppola said. Looking at the bank's profits, she added: \"It's got out of its doldrums, cleaned up its balance sheet, recovered from its acquisition of HBOS and is moving on.\" Group chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said: \"These results highlight the strength of our customer focused, simple and low risk business model.\" The bank's credit card arm performed well, with a reduction in \"persistent\" debt.

The bodies had shields on their chests, spears to one side and one had a dagger in a belt around his waist. The skeletons were found beneath Hyderbad and Meanee Barracks, once home to 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment, which are being redeveloped as housing. \"There is a strong probability these were post Roman 'spearmen', with Germanic or Saxon origin,\" said Trust director Philip Crummy. 'Local militia' \"But there is a tantalising possibility they were 4th or early 5th Century, in which case they could have been part of a militia living here in Roman times.\" Achaeologists have already found Anglo-Saxon burials south of the nearby site of a former Roman circus. These were from the 4th Century and featured small ring-shaped ditches with a single burial inside. The latest discoveries also featured ring ditches, suggesting the spearmen may have been descended from that group. \"Many men from the continent were hired by the Romans and posted at frontier towns and cities like Colchester to act as soldiers,\" said Mr Crummy. \"Some then turned on their masters and paved the way for the conquest of much of eastern Britain by their own kind.\" Colchester Archaeological Trust has been working at the Hyderbad site since 2002, on behalf of developer Taylor Wimpey. The highlight of its excavation was the 2005 discovery of a Roman chariot circus in the gardens of the sergeants' mess. It will carry out more work including DNA tests later this year in an attempt to discover exactly when the newly-discovered warriors lived.\n\nSummary:","218":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A walkway on top of the wall is used by thousands of people every year. The company said it was confident it could find a solution \"which works for almost everyone\". 'Standing and gawping' In the 1840s, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who created the rail line, lost the same battle with a landowner. The landowner insisted the wall should be lowered so he did not lose his privacy, with walkers looking in. Ann Large, who lives in Sea Lawn Terrace which sits on the site of the old house, said: \"The world and his wife will be standing and gawping at the properties [if the wall is raised].\" Another resident said: \"It's going to have an impact on our privacy and security and I'm sure there are other ways of improving the integrity of the seawall.\" But some have voiced their support for the Network Rail option. Peter Large, said: \"I would be much happier if the footpath is raised so it does give us that extra strength and resilience. \"I don't want to go through another 'Black Tuesday' storms like we did this year.

The infection - herpes encephalitis - left him unable to recognise people he had seen or remember things that had been said just moments earlier. But despite being acknowledged by doctors as having one of the most severe cases of amnesia ever, his musical ability and much of his musical memory was intact. Now aged 73, he is still able to read music and play the piano and once even conducted his former choir again. Now researchers believe they are closer to understanding how musical memory is preserved in some people - even when they can remember almost nothing of their past. At a Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington this month, a group of German neurologists described the case of a professional cellist, referred to as PM, who contracted herpes encephalitis virus in 2005. He was unable to retain even simple information, such as the layout of his apartment. But Dr Carsten Finke of Charite University Hospital in Berlin says he was \"astonished\" that the cellist's musical memory was largely intact and that he was still able to play his instrument. The brain's medial temporal lobes, which are largely destroyed by severe cases of herpes encephalitis are \"highly relevant\" for remembering things such as facts and how, where and when an event happened. \"But this case and also the Clive Wearing case suggest that musical memory seems to be stored independently of the medial temporal lobes,\" Dr Finke says. Musical therapy He has also studied the case of a Canadian patient who in the 1990s lost all musical memory after having surgery that damaged another part of the brain known as the superior temporal gyrus. This has led him to conclude that the structures of the brain used for musical memory \"might be the superior temporal gyrus or the frontal lobes\".

However, the government said in August they must change because the European Commission owned the copyright. Now it says the Australian government has agreed to supply alternatives. The change is one of many small ways in which a \"no-deal\" Brexit could affect British life, flagged up by government departments via \"technical notices\". Others included the possibilities of Britons needing international driving permits for European countries, an end to using mobiles free from roaming charges and additional credit card fees. The notices set out the approach to minimising disruption across industries as wide-ranging as shipping, agri-foods, pharmaceuticals and satellite technology. Ministers insist a \"no-deal\" scenario remains unlikely, although No 10 accepts \"big issues\" must be resolved before an agreement can be reached. Requesting feedback on its contingency plans, the Department of Health says there would have to be changes to the way manufacturers were asked to notify UK health and regulatory bodies about the sale of both e-cigarettes and tobacco products.

Sacramento police said a man was seen breaking into at least three vehicles and a neighbour's home. Bodycam and helicopter footage do not clearly show what Mr Clark was doing before he was shot in his own backyard. It is dark in the clip, but a figure is seen hopping over a fence and running into a backyard. Police officers' body cameras show them running along the side of a house to confront the suspect. Two officers who shot Mr Clark are purportedly heard asking him to show his hands and shouting, \"gun, gun, gun\", before opening fire. Police said the suspect approached the officers with an object extended in front of him, which they thought was a handgun. Footage from the helicopter shows Mr Clark collapsing as officers begin to fire, according to the Sacramento Bee. One officer suggested disarming him with a non-lethal weapon, but stopped his thought mid-sentence, according to the footage. \"Let's hit him a couple of times with that before we uh...,\" he is purportedly heard saying. \"What'd he have on him?\" one of the officers asked. \"Something in his hands, it looked like a gun from our perspective,\" an officer responded. Police approached Mr Clark and a mobile phone can be seen lying near his head. He is handcuffed by the officers. While discussing whether to perform CPR, one officer said: \"Hey, mute\". The audio went silent for two minutes. Mr Clark was pronounced dead at the scene. His name was not officially released but his fiancee, Salena Manni, identified him.

When the plant opened in May 1980, it was seen as an industrial landmark in which the car was overtaking coal in Wales. There were still 30,000 working in mining, but 700 jobs at the Lewis Merthyr colliery in the Rhondda were under threat. It is now a museum. There were already about 30 car component companies in south Wales when Bridgend - thanks partly to the personal intervention of then-Prime Minister James Callaghan - won the prize. The Ford announcement in 1978 was described in the South Wales Echo as \"the icing on an already substantial cake\" for the automotive sector. The CBI at the time estimated 25,000 were employed in the car industry in Wales, with a turnover of \u00a3350m. Borg-Warner, which made automatic transmissions at Kenfig near Bridgend, had already opened Wales' first 1m sq ft factory, with jobs for more than 1,200 people. Most of its products went to Volvo in Sweden. There were others too, supplying British Leyland - which had two of its own firms in Cardiff and Llanelli, making gearboxes and radiators. The factory opened in 1980 without fanfare at an economically uncertain time. There was a two-week long strike at local newspapers, so the event passed without comment or record. Within a few weeks of the Bridgend plant opening, Ford announced only 1,400, not 2,500 people, would be employed there because of a slump in car sales. British Leyland was also struggling, with \u00a3122m losses announced. Unemployment was more than double 2020's pre-coronavirus figure and inflation was running at nearly 18%. The new range of Ford Escorts - with Bridgend producing 2,000 engines a week for them - were in car showrooms by the end of September 1980.

Earlier this month Yahoo confirmed it was cutting 15% of its workforce after reporting a $4.3bn (33bn) loss for the year. The job cuts will mean the company will have around 9,000 staff by the end of 2016.

Yet despite its troubles, around a billion people still turn to Yahoo's core services each month - 60% by using their mobile phones.

The court said consulting such bodies would have been \"manifestly in the interest of vulnerable children\". The government says it is disappointed by the ruling. 'Substantial changes' Children's rights group Article 39 mounted the challenge against what it called a \"bonfire of children's rights\" after the government changed the rules safeguarding children through the Adoption and Children (Coronavirus) (Amendment) regulations in April. Parliament did not debate the changes until after they were introduced in April. The legal challenge came after a lengthy battle between the government, peers, opposition MPs and children's rights groups over attempts to push through the changes which cover the rights to support for children in care. The High Court previously ruled in the government's favour. The regulations affected included legal timescales for social-worker visits to children in care, six-monthly reviews of children's welfare, independent scrutiny of children's homes and senior officer oversight of adoption decision-making for babies and children. The protections affected also cover disabled children having short breaks and children in care sent many miles away from home. The government had argued in an earlier court hearing that these changes were \"minor bureaucratic burdens\", but the Appeal Court said the alterations to children's rights were \"substantial and wide-ranging\". After the government review of the legislation was begun in February, Department for Education officials had private telephone, email and face-to-face conversations with adoption agencies, private providers and local government bodies. 'One-sided' But bodies representing children and young people affected by the changes were not consulted, and the children's commissioner - the statutory protect\n\nSummary:","233":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Councillors voted to silence the clock after midnight and up to 06:00. Bosses at three businesses have agreed to pay the bill of about \u00a33,000 for a new mechanism to adjust the chimes which currently sound every 15 minutes. B&B owner Tina Lovatt said it would be \"money well spent\" as customers had complained about the noise, even though she had fitted triple glazing and additional sound proofing. \"The outcome is good but it didn't come without a backlash,\" she said, referring to comments from other people opposed to the decision by Newtown and Llanllwchaiarn Town Council. The clock was given to the people of Newtown in 1900. Town mayor David Selby said councillors had agreed to switch off the chimes overnight to support businesses even though his public consultation showed an even split on whether to silence the clock or not. He said Newtown was a \"destination town\" and it was important for hotels to get \"repeat business\". \"The council listened carefully,\" he said. \"We are not switching the clock off. We are allowing it to strike to midnight.\" One guest who stayed in a B&B in the town rated the experience as \"terrible\" on TripAdvisor, saying they checked out a day early on a two-night stay \"due to the unbearable noise from the town clock that rings every 15 minutes 24 hours a day\".

They can appear in an enhanced DBS check, which critics say risks penalising innocent people. One Police and Crime Commissioner said it \"won't protect a soul\". 'Foot in the door' The leaflets have been issued by Hampshire Police 54 times since their introduction in November 2016, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned. A total of 52 were given to men with 34 handed to people aged 25 and under. The force said the notices were used in cases where officers did not have enough evidence to charge a person with an offence, but were still concerned about their sexual behaviour. One example given was of a woman who was reported to police after 15 and 16-year-old boys were seen in her flat. Sergeant Antony Waghorn said officers, in delivering the notice to her, were able to educate her on the age of consent, giving them a \"foot in the door... to go and speak to her and have a look around\". The woman has not come to police attention since being issued with the notice. Labour MP Sarah Champion, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Preventing Sexual Violence, said she was in favour of the initiative. \"What I'm hoping is, with Hampshire Police issuing these notices, it stops people in their tracks. \"That it makes them realise what they're doing - or what they're potentially thinking about - is a crime. \"That's the best way to protect children.\" 'Criminalisation by default' A number of other police forces are also considering introducing the forms, the BBC understands. But Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird, the national lead for child sexual abuse cases and a former barrister, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was worried the scheme \"won't protect a soul\" and would actually \"put police off the scent\" during an investigation. \"I don't know of anything else like this at all.

Twenty-one people from Jersey were deported and died in concentration camps between 1940 and 1945. A private candle-lighting service will replace this year's public event in line with Covid regulations in Jersey. Islanders were subject to strict rules during the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WW2. Among those deported for defying the regime were father and son Clarence and Peter Painter. Peter, aged 20, died in his father's arms while imprisoned at Gross Rosen concentration camp in Germany. Clarence died a year later in a train wagon while being transferred between camps. Now in its 20th year, the annual commemoration will be limited to ten attendees and by invitation only. Candle lanterns will be lit at dusk at the Lighthouse memorial on the New North Quay, and a wreath-laying service will be led by the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Stephen Dalton. Islanders will also be asked to observe a minute's silence to remember \"not just the victims of Nazi persecution but all those who have since suffered\", said Holocaust Memorial Committee secretary Paula Thelwell. She added: \"The size of commemorations may be diminished or moved online but the scale of the cruelty, injustices and pain the victims suffered must never be forgotten.\" The candle lanterns have been inspired by this year's national theme, to \"be the light in the darkness\".

They assert that it may include the bodies of executed Chinese inmates, including political prisoners. But the organisers of Real Bodies: The Exhibition have strongly denied those allegations, calling them \"lies\" and \"sensationalism\". They say the 20 cadavers were legally provided by a medical university in China, where hospitals had determined them to be \"unclaimed corpses\". WARNING: Readers may find some images in this article disturbing The bodies have been preserved through a method known as plastination, which drains them of fluids before replacing them with silicone. This allows the skinned bodies to be exhibited in life-like poses. What is the concern? In an open letter to Australian politicians, the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China says there is \"credible evidence\" that the bodies may belong to \"executed prisoners and prisoners of conscience from China\". \"We are astonished that visas and permits for bringing this exhibition into Australia were issued by the Australian Government, given the lack of documentation demonstrating ethical and legal sourcing of each body,\" the letter reads. \"No motivation for profit or political sensitivities could ever justify such a crass and undignified violation of human rights.\" One signatory, Prof Maria Fiatarone Singh from the University of Sydney's medical school, told the BBC that the origin of the bodies - the city of Dalian - was a concern. She described Dalian as the \"epicentre\" for executions of prisoners associated with Falun Gong - a spiritual movement that is banned in China. Prof Vaughan Macefield, from the University of Western Sydney, said he was troubled that the bodies had not been identified. He also noted that most appeared to be young men, whereas medical schools often have bodies donated from older people.

If you've been following some of the coverage and started to feel like you're in an exam which you didn't revise for, worry not. Many people feel the same - and not all of them are outside the newsroom! Whether you're glued to the 24-hour news or just checking in with the latest developments, here's our 'back to square one' guide to a few of the words and phrases you'll hear in the next few days. Removing the whip No, it's nothing to do with having your car taken away. A whip is a person in a political party who gets MPs to vote how the party wants them to. Basically, they're there to enforce discipline within the party - to make sure MPs toe the line. So if you're a Conservative MP and the party's trying to pass a new law, the whip is there to make sure you turn up and vote. You might also have heard talk about a \"three-line whip.\" That's a reference to the weekly letter that goes round to MPs and Lords, telling them which votes are coming up. The votes are underlined if your party's whip thinks it's important you back them. If one is underlined three times - the three-line whip - they insist you vote the way they want. Fail to do that and you risk a stiff talking-to, or more severe punishment. The most severe is \"having the whip withdrawn\" - which means you are kicked out of the party within Parliament. You remain an MP but immediately become an independent - not aligned to, say, Labour or the Conservatives. That's what happened to 21 Tory (Conservative) MPs on Monday night, when they voted against their own government. People including Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames and Ken Clarke, who's been a Tory MP for 49 years, were among those who had the whip removed. That means the number of Conservative MPs in the House of Commons has fallen. Which brings us on to...

The Glaswegian, 42, said he had not expected to win \"in a million years\". The final was watched by 13.1 million viewers at its peak, with an average audience of 11.6 million. McFadden, who won the public vote, is the oldest champion of the show, which was in its 15th series. \"It feels completely surreal and I'm so in awe of everyone who started all of those weeks ago,\" he said. He called Jones an \"amazing woman\", adding \"thank you for sticking with me and persevering\". His partner Jones said: \"You did it, you are so brilliant.\" It was a grand final which featured top-scoring dances from three of the four contestants - only Atkinson missed out. McFadden and Jones performed the final dance of the series, a Charleston, and claimed a perfect score of 40. He finished second on the leaderboard, one point behind singer Burke, with McGee and Atkinson third and fourth respectively, but topped the public vote. 'Genius' Following his final dance, head judge Shirley Ballas said: \"You've done things I never thought you would be able to do. You have truly turned into a magnificent dancer.\" Jones was competing in only her second series after finishing sixth last year with former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who tweeted his congratulations following her victory.

The pair first met at the British Fashion Awards in 2016 and are now \"close friends\", says GQ on its website. But the cover has fuelled more speculation the pair are dating. The supermodel teased the images from the shoot on Instagram before the full cover was released on Thursday. The pair were first introduced by British Vogue editor Edward Enninful at the awards and went on to the after party together, according to GQ. \"A series of Instagram images with love heart emojis chronicle the friendship that blossomed, which, this year, took a professional turn,\" the magazine says. The pair have teamed up together to work on a new underwear line as part of Skepta's MAINS fashion collection. For the GQ cover shoot, both Skepta and Naomi Campbell are pictured in the brand's boxer shorts. GQ haven't released any more pictures or details of the interview with the pair but says they talk about \"race, sex, love and power\". Although they've never confirmed an official relationship, fans have speculated for a while that they're more than friends. Skepta, whose real name is Joseph Junior Adenuga, has had a meteoric rise and is currently viewed as one of the trailblazers of the grime music scene. That was cemented last year when the 35-year-old's album, Konnichiwa, won the Mercury prize for album of the year. As for Naomi Campbell, 47, she remains one of the most iconic supermodels on the planet. Her CV includes being the first black model to open for fashion house Prada when she walked during Milan Fashion Week back in 1997. She's now a contributing editor for British Vogue and spends a lot of her time campaigning for various charities and causes around the world. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

Her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s. Home Secretary Theresa May said she did not regret appointing the peer, adding that she would \"not hang around\" in naming her successor. Lady Butler-Sloss said she \"did not sufficiently consider\" whether her family links would cause difficulties in the inquiry. 'Right person' Downing Street said it would \"take a few days\" to appoint a new chairman and appeared to indicate that whoever was chosen would not be so closely linked to the establishment. Mrs May told MPs that she believed Lady Butler-Sloss was the \"right person for the job\" despite what she suggested was a lot of \"rumour and innuendo\" about her appointment. \"I do not regret the decision I made. I continue to believe that Elizabeth Butler-Sloss would have done an excellent job as chair of this inquiry,\" she told the Home Affairs select committee. Asked about her successor, Mrs May said she still favoured appointing a single individual to head the over-arching inquiry rather than a panel of experts urged by Labour and some abuse victims. She said she hoped to name a new candidate \"within a reasonable amount of time\" but said whoever was approached would need to \"think carefully\" about the nature of the role. Keith Vaz, chairman of the committee, which is also investigating historical child sex abuse, said the handling of the issue had been \"somewhat shambolic\" and raised issues about Mrs May's judgement.

The trust, which was renamed in 1994, now has 25,000 members, 42 reserves and represents over 1,300 hectares of wildlife havens. DWT acquired its first reserve at Holway Woods, Sherborne, in 1965. This was led by the then honorary secretary and wildlife champion Helen Brotherton, who died in 2009. Celebrity help Many other pioneering conservationists have been involved with the work of DWT over the years. In 1985 David Attenborough helped build the causeway to the Macdonald Hide on Brownsea Island; and David Bellamy planted a tree to celebrate the opening of the trust's headquarters at Brookland's Farm, Forston in 1995. More recently, Kate Humble and Bill Oddie presented BBC Autumnwatch from Brownsea Island in 2008; and in 2010 Simon King was at Kimmeridge Bay for BBC Springwatch. DWT's reserves range from West Bexington in the west of the county to Sopley Common in the east. These include rare and precious wildlife habitats from heathland to flower meadows, to wetlands and ancient woods, said a spokesman. Dr Simon Cripps, DWT's chief executive, said: \"Conservation in the new millennium takes in much of the wider landscape outside the reserves - with farmers, fishermen, communities and wildlife gardeners all playing their part.\" DWT has joined other wildlife trusts around the country in campaigning for the protection of the UK's seas. Their campaign was followed by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, which promises marine reserves by 2012.

His wife Lindsey told Manchester Court of Protection her husband would have seen living in a minimally conscious state as \"hell\". Doctors treating him at the Walton Centre in Liverpool are opposing the application to withdraw treatment. PC Briggs from Wirral, suffered a bleed on the brain and five fractures in his spine in the collision and is being kept alive through medical intervention. In closing submissions, Victoria Butler-Cole, representing Mrs Briggs, asked the judge Mr Justice Charles to respect the previous wishes of the police officer and allow him to die. She said even in the best case scenario, PC Briggs would not have a quality of life which he would have previously felt was worthwhile. Pain and distress Ms Butler-Cole said: \"He has pockets of consciousness in which he may, if things are going well, be able to press a buzzer in response to a question.\" Medical experts have told the hearing PC Briggs could emerge from the state he is in, but would remain severely physically disabled and would not regain the mental capacity to fully understand his condition. Vikram Sachdeva QC, representing the official solicitor acting on behalf of PC Briggs, asked whether he should be deprived of a \"reasonably content future\" even if it was a situation he would have been \"appalled\" by before the crash. Conrad Hallin, representing Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust and the Wirral Clinical Commissioning Group, said PC Briggs was not likely to be tormented and trapped psychologically by his condition but withdrawing artificial hydration and nutrition would cause him to starve to death and likely to cause him pain and distress. The hearing has finished and the judge will make his judgment at a later date.

Cancer Research UK has launched a new tool that allows people to compare cancer statistics in their area with those in the rest of the country. It hopes the local data will help doctors and politicians tackle the specific problems in their patch. There is separate data for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the greater Glasgow area had the highest cancer mortality while Shetland had the lowest. Mortality was much higher in Belfast than the rest of Northern Ireland. Merthyr Tydfil was one of the worst performing parts of Wales, while Ceredigion had better cancer survival rates. Harrow, Richmond and Surrey in the south of England performed better than areas further north such as Stoke, Hartlepool and Nottingham. Smoking A significant factor in the regional variation is differences in lifestyle, such as smoking, which is linked to lung cancer. Kensington and Chelsea, East Sussex and Devon all had fewer than 35 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 people. The rate is more than double - in excess of 85 per 100,000, in cities such as Hull, Manchester and Liverpool. A similar website presented by Public Health England led Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to describe the differences in England as \"shocking\".

If approved it is estimated that it would generate \u00a31.9m a year for local projects and a further \u00a31.2m going to region-wide initiatives. The current arrangements for community benefits from wind farms have been in operation since 2005 - and since then there have been five such agreements.

However, there has been a big increase in the number of wind energy schemes in recent years. There are 26 developments of more than 5MW within the planning system and 148 smaller schemes.

Animal charities said thousands of dogs, which are often bred in \"appalling conditions\" on puppy farms, are brought into the UK each year. A number of groups have called for rules on imports to be tightened. David Bowles, from the RSPCA, said: \"The scale of the illegal importation of puppies into this country is truly shocking. \"Thousands of dogs arriving at our shores every year may well have started their lives in appalling conditions on a puppy farm where their health and welfare came second to money and profits.\" The RSPCA said the age puppies can be brought into the UK should be raised from 15 weeks to six months, with the Dogs Trust saying such measures \"would eliminate the abhorrent illegal puppy trade overnight\". One woman described how she re-homed a bulldog that was originally brought into the country illegally, but died soon afterwards. Karina said: \"They make these homes up. \"You think you're going to visit a nice home, family home, with pictures of dogs everywhere, and you're visiting these puppies and it all seems very much as it should. \"Unfortunately that's not the case - and that's just from the little bit of research I've done.\" She warned other potential pet owners to think twice and not rush into anything without doing their homework first. The all-party parliamentary group for animal welfare said: \"We believe raising this age to six months would make it easier for enforcement agents to age puppies better, reduce the incentives for illegal puppy dealers to import puppies given that they are at their most desirable between the ages of two to three months, and raise welfare standards in puppies being bred in the UK.\" A Defra spokesman said the UK had one of the toughest pet border-checking regimes, but pet owners could help by buying puppies from reputable dealers.

The review's chair, Baroness Julia Cumberlege, said she was \"appalled at the seriousness and scale of the tragic stories\" that her team had heard. Many women say the implants caused them agony by cutting into tissue. Some say they have been left with life-changing injuries. Claire Cooper, who had the implants, mistakenly had a hysterectomy after doctors were unable to diagnose what was causing her pain. She was left feeling suicidal and unable to have sex. It is estimated that more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or another condition called prolapse. Most patients suffer no ill effects, NHS England says. Not a total ban England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Dame Sally Davies, said mesh would remain a treatment of last resort for some: \"Carefully selected patients will continue to have access in discussion with their consultant.\" Baroness Cumberlege said the independent review found no evidence on the benefits for treating urinary incontinence that would outweigh \"the severity of human suffering caused by mesh complications\". \"My team and I are in no doubt that this pause is necessary. We must stop exposing women to the risk of life-changing and life-threatening injuries. We must have measures in place to mitigate the risk, and those are sadly lacking at the moment. \"At this stage in our review we are not recommending a ban, but a halt to procedures.\" The pause can be lifted if certain checks and measures are met by March 2019, says the review team. This includes keeping a register of every procedure and any complications. To date, it's still unclear how many women have been adversely affected by mesh.

They are one of only three schools to make it to the senior final, hosted by presenter Aled Jones. It will be shown on BBC One on Sunday at 14:40 BST. Their success is doubly impressive as all of the members of the choir are facing GCSE and A-Level exams over the next few weeks. But choir member Lexi McKechnie, who is about to sit her A-Levels, said she had managed to balance singing with study. \"Mrs McIvor, our music teacher, has tried to make it easy on us by only using lunchtimes, which are times we usually wouldn't be revising anyway,\" she said. \"I think all the upper sixth members really enjoy chamber choir as it's fun to get together and sing together.\" Her fellow singer Ide Simpson, who is about to sit her GCSEs, agreed. \"To me it doesn't really feel like a lot of hard work as it's so much fun,\" she said. \"We get together three lunchtimes a week and it's really like a break from all of the stress that we would have throughout the day.\" However, all of the 23 members took revision to do with them when they travelled to Wales for the Songs of Praise recordings. Getting to this stage has taken months of hard work, according to music teacher Heather McIvor. \"It's really a culmination of a year's work,\" she told BBC News NI. \"We start rehearsals in September and you're working on things all the time like your vocal production and your tone. \"Then we were honing in on two specific pieces so really it was six months to get the pieces up to that standard and to get the girls to sing with one voice.\" The choir has been performing the songs \"Be Still My Soul\" and \"Get Happy\" for the competition.

The French have the unfortunate distinction of being the European \"champions\" for abandoning pets that have become too cumbersome for their summer trips. Animal shelters up and down the country are proof of this unique and sad tradition. Betty Loizeau has run a shelter just north of Toulouse for more than 20 years. There are rabbits, a pig and even a goat here and each has their own individual story of abandonment. \"Owners rarely have the courage to turn up with their unwanted companions,\" she says. \"Instead they call up to say where they can be found, or drop them off in boxes outside the shelter under the cover of darkness.\" Curled up at the very back of a cage sits a silent, hesitant, white-haired cat. Pom Pom's male owner gave her up after 15 years because he got a new girlfriend who didn't like cats. Another feline, Misha, has a badly twisted leg after jumping from a balcony. Her owner didn't want to pay the vet's fees and that's how she ended up in a shelter. There are plenty of dogs here, too. Pepito is a five-year-old miniature pinscher whose owners tied him up next to a lamp-post before calling the refuge. \"The excuses they typically give are that they're going on holiday, having a baby, moving house, or they have a new partner with allergies, \" Ms Loizeau explains. She says the owners come from all social classes, but cases of badly treated animals are higher on the poor housing estates and amongst the Roma Traveller community. For shelters like this one, it is the busiest time of the year. Given that just over half of all French households have at least one pet, it would be fair to assume they are a nation of pet lovers. Yet, every summer, emotional animal rights campaigns are launched nationwide to try and persuade people to look after their animals.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) said it \"regrets\" the \"significant delays\". Fund re-tests In May, the Irish government said it would fund re-tests for anyone concerned about previous assessments. Earlier this month, Emma Mhic Mhath\u00fana, a mother-of-five from County Kerry, died at the age of 37. She was one of the most public figures in the 'CervicalCheck' national screening programme crisis. She was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016 after receiving two incorrect smear test results. The Health Service Executive (HSE) said that between May and September almost 42,500 repeat tests were undertaken. However, the results of more than 86,000 samples have still not been progressed and reported. The normal backlog is around 23,000 tests. Some women are waiting 18 weeks to receive their results. The HSE also confirmed that Colposcopy clinics, which receive notifications of abnormalities, are experiencing an increase in demand. Additional capacity In a statement, the HSE said: \"The HSE regrets that we are currently experiencing significant delays in the reporting of cervical smear test results. \"The programme has operated for many years with a reporting time of between four and six weeks for cervical screening. \"Unfortunately results are currently being reported within 18 weeks of the test being taken. In a small number of cases this may take longer. \"We would like to apologise to those patients affected and assure them that everything possible is being done to improve the situation.\" The HSE said it has asked laboratories to undertake \"additional recruitment\" and also \"to streamline processes around release of reports\". \"As many countries move to HPV, as the primary screening test for cervical screening, there are global challenges in recruiting and retaining \n\nSummary:","255":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But if a picture ever prompted a thousand words, it was this one. Early rumblings The hash-tags sprung up instantly. Islington, Ms Thornberry's parliamentary seat, became less a borough than an abstraction, furthering a perception, according to Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, that the Labour Party \"has been hijacked by the north London liberal elite\". The S-word - 15:13 @GuidoFawkes (137,000 followers) ensures @EmilyThornberry (14,400 followers) gets a bigger platform for her views. Tories lick their lips Communities Secretary Eric Pickles was first in with the knife, saying: \"We should have pride in flying the Cross of St George - don't knock the national flag of England.\" Prime Minister David Cameron also appreciated the free hit, saying the Labour MP's actions were \"completely appalling\" and suggesting that she was \"sneering at people who work hard, are patriotic and love their country\". Backpedalling - 18:15 Emily Thornberry told Mail Online: \"It was a house covered in British flags. I've never seen anything like it before.\" \"It had three huge flags covering the whole house.

They have set aside \u00a31.4bn to aid firms reeling from the impact of the virus. In other developments, Toyota has suspended production at Deeside, and the Church in Wales has said services should be put on hold. Meanwhile, second home owners and caravanners have been urged not to come to north Wales to self-isolate. A GP said health services have been inundated by people with second homes in Gwynedd looking for medical care. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the measures introduced on Monday \"should reduce\" peak demand on the NHS by over 60%. \"It's no longer appropriate for people to be gathering in large groups\", Dr Atherton added. On Tuesday it was announced a second patient in Wales had died from coronavirus. The 96-year-old was being treated at Morriston Hospital, Swansea. Thirteen new cases have tested positive for COVID-19 in Wales, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 149 - although the true number of cases is likely to be higher - and the virus has now been detected in every council area, according to health bosses.

Mark Drakeford was sworn in as first minister earlier, after Senedd members backed him to continue in the role on Wednesday. Labour won 30 of the 60 seats in the Welsh Parliament in last week's election. Both Mr Gething and Mr Skates had been in their previous posts for five years. Mr Gething had a particularly high profile as health minister during the pandemic, in leading the response to the coronavirus crisis alongside Mr Drakeford and the chief medical officer. Announcing the changes, the first minister paid tribute to Mr Skates, who he said would \"continue speaking up for north Wales and for Welsh Labour, but in a different role\". \"We will miss his energy and passion,\" he said. Mr Drakeford said Mr Gething's efforts during the pandemic had been \"extraordinary\" but he felt it was time \"to ask someone else to take on that challenge\". The former health minister, he said, was taking over the economy job \"at a crucial point in time - the pandemic is not just a public health emergency but also an economic one\". 'Fronting up' Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said there had been \"rumours for a while that Vaughan Gething wanted to move from the health portfolio\". \"He's been in position there for five years and was a deputy before that, and that's quite a long stint really, in a very difficult role and not least, of course, during a pandemic, so I can see the logic to that,\" she told BBC Radio Wales. Prof McAllister said his replacement, Eluned Morgan, as health minister had a \"very effective time during the pandemic in terms of fronting up on government policy, sometimes at very difficult times\", and she was being rewarded for that.

He will also extend a scheme that offers rate relief to small businesses. But he will stop short of a full review of a system widely seen as outdated, BBC correspondent Hugh Pym says. This is despite calls for such a move by some industry groups, as well as Business Secretary Vince Cable. Lost revenue Business rates were set to rise by 3.2% next year, based as usual on the September retail prices index measure of inflation. But there has been intense lobbying by business organisations for a rethink by the chancellor. It is understood he will cap the increase at 2%, a move which will mean more than \u00a3300m of revenue is lost next year. He will also announce the extension for another year of a scheme which gives small firms relief from rates liability. Hugh Pym - BBC chief economics correspondent - said business rates were seen by many retailers as a crippling burden at a time when some High Streets were struggling.

Wilson was US president from 1913 to 1921 and helped to establish the League of Nations, a forerunner of the UN. However, he supported segregation and imposed it on several federal agencies. He also barred black students from Princeton while serving as university president and spoke approvingly of the Ku Klux Klan. In a separate development on Saturday, the lower house of the Mississippi state congress passed a resolution that could remove the Confederate emblem - now viewed by many as a racist symbol - from the state flag. Mississippi's Republican Governor Tate Reeves tweeted that he would sign a bill to change the current flag if the legislation was approved, saying arguments over the 1894 emblem had become as divisive as the flag itself. The measure now moves to a Senate committee before going to the chamber. Outlining the university's decision on Saturday to remove Wilson's name, Princeton president Christopher Eisgruber said in a statement that \"Wilson's racism was significant and consequential even by the standards of his own time\". He said that the board of trustees had concluded that \"Wilson's racist views and policies make him an inappropriate namesake\" for the university's public policy school. A residential college will also lose Wilson's name. The name of the school will be changed to the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Mr Eisgruber said Princeton had honoured President Wilson \"not because of, but without regard to or perhaps even in ignorance of, his racism\". \"That, however, is ultimately the problem,\" he added. \"Princeton is part of an America that has too often disregarded, ignored, or excused racism, allowing the persistence of systems that discriminate against black people.\" Earlier this month, Monmouth University in New Jersey removed Woodrow Wilson's name from one of its most prominent buildings.

The justice ministry said Adel al-Mashhadani - allegedly a leader of a local Sunni militia known as Sahwa - was among those put to death on Sunday. Iraq executed at least 151 people last year, up from 129 in 2012 and 18 in 2010, according to Human Rights Watch. 'Brutal crimes' It follows calls from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights for an immediate halt to executions in Iraq. A spokesman for Navi Pillay said in October large-scale killings were \"obscene and inhumane\". The claim that the death penalty helped deter terrorism was a \"fallacy\", given the surging violence in Iraq, the spokesman added. \"The justice ministry carried out the executions of 26 men convicted of crimes related to terrorism on Sunday,\" a justice ministry statement said on Tuesday, adding that all of those put to death were Iraqis. It said Mashhadani was \"famous for sectarian crimes\". He was a leader of a Sahwa, or Awakening Council, in Baghdad, according to reports. \"All 26 who were executed carried out brutal terrorist crimes against the Iraqi people, and they were tried and condemned, and the verdict was approved by the presidency,\" Justice Minister Hassan al-Shammari said. He added that the ministry would \"continue to carry out sentences against those who have been condemned, after the final decision has been made\". The Iraqi government maintains that it only executes people who have committed terrorist acts or other serious crimes against civilians. The findings published in Human Right Watch's annual world report on Tuesday put the number of executions in Iraq at its highest since the US-led invasion of 2003. It is broadly in line with other tallies.

The NI Tourism Alliance (NITA) said \"businesses may not be able to survive until the end of April much less start making grant applications\". The Department for the Economy said it was doing everything possible to expedite the scheme. Another scheme for small businesses has already paid out \u00a310,000 grants to thousands of small firms. But that scheme essentially involved one database and so was highly automated. The tourism scheme involves checks against four databases which will have to be done manually. \"The process to identify and validate eligible businesses from different databases is complex and manual,\" the Department for the Economy said. \"However, we our pouring our efforts into delivering it efficiently and effectively.\" 'Upfront staffing costs' NITA chief executive Joanne Stuart said Stormont should make immediate interim payments. She said businesses had anticipated that the grants would be available in advance of the government's coronavirus job retention scheme. That scheme allows employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their wages during the crisis. It is also due to open for applications on 20 April with payments beginning on 30 April. \"Whilst the job retention scheme was welcomed by many tourism businesses, the fact that it has not gone live yet means that businesses are incurring upfront staffing costs which it was anticipated that the grants would have supported,\" said Ms Stuart. \"This meant we would have had an interim cash flow that would have plugged the gap until the scheme went live, however as the grants have not been distributed businesses may not be able to survive until the end of April.\" That view is echoed by Ken Sharpe who owns the Salty Dog Hotel in Bangor.

For a month, the authorities have been playing a game of grandmother's footsteps with the West, as they tried to avoid delivering a verdict during awkward events like the visit of international dignitaries to the annual YES Yalta summit in Crimea, or the EU's eastern partnership summit in Warsaw. Still, the Ukrainians got a tough message by EU standards. For some time now, Ukraine has been trying to finalise a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with Brussels - which is more important than it sounds. In the absence of an EU membership perspective, a DCFTA would help transform Ukrainian society by introducing EU standards in the way that states like Poland or Estonia were transformed in the 1990s. Before the verdict, these agreements were still on track to be signed in December, but the EU had made it clear that depended on Tymoshenko staying out of prison and the Ukrainian authorities were hinting at some messy, face-saving compromise. So many were shocked by the severity of the verdict. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years, and must pay a fine of $190m (\u00a3122m). She is banned from running for office for three years, which would rule her out of the next elections, for parliament, in 2012. The trial itself was already an embarrassment. To try and discourage too many attendees, it was held in a tiny court, which became a packed circus. A young and inexperienced judge failed to defend principles of sub judice in the face of a stream of prejudicial comments from state officials. The authorities switched from one accusation to another before the trial. Worst of all was the failure to provide a smoking gun once they decided the main charge would be Tymoshenko's role in the gas price negotiations with Russia in 2009. Tymoshenko settled for a high price, which cost Ukraine dear; but this was just after the infamous cut-off that left much of Europe f\n\nSummary:","263":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

More wet weather is expected later and there is one flood warning. The Environment Agency issued the warning for the Lower Dee river, which stretches from Wrexham to Chester and Connah's Quay. It also issued 20 flood alerts for Wales. On Saturday the agency said the heavy rain was making conditions on the road \"difficult\" and warned that river levels could rise. But South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had not been \"inundated with calls\" overnight and had dealt with roughly 14 call-outs to houses in Newport and Monmouth that had been affected by flooding. Gwent Police said the A48 at Penhow, Newport, was closed in both directions because of flooding near Pike Road but it later reopened. Motorists are also warned of flooding on the A4226 at Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan and the B4271 between Llanrhidian and Llangennith, Swansea.

They say they will give incentives for alternative vehicle use and promote walking and cycling. The commitments were made in Mexico at a biennial meeting of city leaders. The use of diesel in transport has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, as concerns about its impact on air quality have grown. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that around three million deaths every year are linked to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Europe pollution 'kills 467,000 a year' Diesel cars: What's all the fuss about? London air quality alerts announced Diesel engines contribute to the problem in two key ways - through the production of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Very fine soot PM can penetrate the lungs and can contribute to cardiovascular illness and death. Nitrogen oxides can help form ground level ozone and this can exacerbate breathing difficulties, even for people without a history of respiratory problems. As the evidence has mounted, environmental groups have used the courts to try and enforce clear air standards and regulations. In the UK, campaigners have recently had success in forcing the government to act more quickly. Now, mayors from a number of major cities with well known air quality problems have decided to use their authority to clamp down on the use of diesel. In the UK, campaigners are calling for London's mayor to commit to phase out diesel vehicles from London by 2025.

Not many - but Bo Rap is one of them. A sprawling, six-minute rock opera, it has been Christmas number one twice, soundtracked a pivotal scene in Wayne's World, and sold 2.44 million copies in the UK alone. Not bad for a song the record company said would never be played on the radio. Written by frontman Freddie Mercury, Bohemian Rhapsody was painstakingly pieced together in six studios, pushing 1970s recording technology to its limits. The song's multi-tracked 'bismillahs' and 'scaramouches' were overdubbed so often that the tapes became virtually transparent. But the band never lost faith in the track. \"We all realised it was something wonderful and we should give it our heart and soul,\" says Brian May. To mark the 40th anniversary, the guitarist looked back at the writing process, the boundary-breaking music video, and the song's resurrection in Wayne's World. THE BEGINNING There was no demo. It was all in Freddie's head and on lots of little pieces of paper, which he used to make notes on. And I mean literally notes. He would put A\u266d, C\u266f, D\u266d in little blocks. So Freddie had the framework in his head and he and Roger [Taylor, drums] and John [Deacon, bass] set out each part as a backing track. Then we set about embroidering it. RECORDING 'THAT' RIFF The heavy bit was a great opportunity for us to be at full pelt as a rock band. But that big, heavy riff came from Freddie, not me. That was something he played with his left hand in octaves on the piano. So I had that as a guide - and that's very hard to do, because Freddie's piano playing was exceptional, although he didn't think so. In fact, he thought he was a bit of a mediocre piano player and stopped doing it later on in our career.

The Butler, starring Forest Whitaker as a White House staff member who serves eight presidents, took second place. One Direction's documentary This Is Us dropped to number six. The pop group's 3D film saw its takings tumble from $15.8m to $4.1m in its second week of release - but has already recouped its modest $10m budget several times over. It was originally thought to have topped the US box office last weekend - but final figures overturned early estimates, placing The Butler back at number one. It meant that the civil rights drama was the first film of 2013 to spend three weeks at the top of the chart. Riddick was the only new release last week, but it gave a boost to a traditionally sluggish September box office. \"Typically, the weekend after Labor Day is one of the slowest weekends of the year,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for Hollywood.com. \"By Universal releasing a brand-new sci-fi movie with one of the biggest stars in the world, they took advantage of that and came out on top. It gave the weekend a nice boost.\" Other films in the top five included Spanish-language comedy Instructions Not Included, starring and directed by Mexican television star Eugenio Derbez, at number three. Jennifer Aniston comedy We're The Millers came fourth, with Disney animation Planes fifth. Cameo deal Vin Diesel first played Riddick, an alien mercenary with glowing eyes, in 2000's low-budget thriller Pitch Black. It proved to be his breakout role, after bit parts in films such as Saving Private Ryan. It generated a live-action sequel, The Chronicles Of Riddick, in 2004. Plans for further instalments evaporated when the film only took $116m, against a budget of $100m.

The family's London-based lawyers have set out their demands in a legal document, submitted to the Maltese government on Thursday. The legal document urges Malta to set up a \"public inquiry into the question of whether Malta breached its protective obligation\" under Article Two of the European Convention on Human Rights. That article says \"everyone's right to life shall be protected by law\". Malta, like all other EU member states, has signed the convention. In a statement, the Maltese government said: \"The government of Malta takes such issues seriously. We will take time to consider the opinion properly and act accordingly.\" Three suspects - brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio and their friend Vince Muscat - were arrested during a police operation in December. They were charged with murder, and pleaded not guilty at a court hearing. They remain in custody. No closure for bereaved The family's lawyers say a public inquiry \"must be truly independent of the Maltese police, government and politicians\". They recommend the appointment of a panel including respected international judges. Paul Caruana Galizia said such an inquiry must take place, to provide a \"full and complete picture\" of the circumstances surrounding his mother's death. \"Until you can stop asking 'Could we have done anything differently? Could the state have done anything differently?' then you feel like you can't grieve,\" he said.

The town's mayor previously complained about similarly \"completely unchallenged\" customers at a Tesco. Councillor June Goodchild said she saw 75 people go into Sainsbury's without masks on. The supermarket chain said it had followed government guidance. 'Very worrying' The ward member for Ladgate told the council's culture and communities scrutiny panel: \"I'm concerned about these convenience stores - I watched 90 people go in and 75 of them didn't have masks on. It's very worrying. \"I phoned Sainsbury's and asked them what the hell they were playing at - they said they had no enforcement [power] to say 'please wear a face covering'.\" Public Health England data shows there were 60 coronavirus cases in Middlesbrough in the week to 7 September with the town's rate at 42.6 per 100,000 people. It remains on the government's watch list as an \"area of concern\". Ms Goodchild confirmed it was Sainsbury's Broughton Avenue branch where she had seen problems on Tuesday. She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service she had contacted the firm \"begging\" them to take action and explaining staff had been ignored after requesting masks were worn. Council officers said they would pass on the concerns to the enforcement team.

It prompted a backlash with one Chinese firm suspending all business with UBS. UBS confirmed Mr Donovan would return to work on Wednesday. The remarks, made an interview for a podcast, were seized upon by Chinese media because the word \"pig\" in China is used to connote stupidity and laziness. Mr Donovan, who has worked for UBS since 1992, had been referring to the impact of swine fever on inflation and consumer prices of pork. But several news outlets falsely described the comments as racist, sparking calls online to boycott the bank. Mr Donovan later apologised on TV, saying: \"I apologise for anyone who took any offence from my remarks, which were clearly not intended to offend. \"I got it wrong. I made a mistake, and I unwittingly used hugely culturally insensitive language.\" But it did not sate critics, with China's state-run Global Times newspaper claiming that Mr Donovan's apology was \"not sincere\" and reflected \"the deep arrogance of Western elites to Chinese culture\". It is a delicate time for Western companies operating in China, as Beijing faces an escalating trade war with the US and political unrest in Hong Kong. In August, the boss of British-backed Cathay Pacific - Hong Kong's biggest airline - had to step down over his muddled response to pro-democracy protests in the territory. Last week, the Financial Times reported that a lawyer for investment bank BNP Paribas in Hong Kong had quit after he posted comments on Facebook about the protests.

The Prime Minister choose the site of Nottingham's new Enterprise Zone for his speech on the need for continuing deficit reduction. It was a set-piece event in front of local invited Tory activists, candidates and the live cameras of the news channels. The blue backdrop highlighted the key slogan or buzzwords of the day. As the Prime Minister told his audience, the themes of his later campaign speeches will focus on education, homes, jobs and pensions. The Nottingham speech concentrated on deficit reduction and \u00a330bn worth of further cuts in government spending in the next parliament. \"When you look at the children you love, do you want to land them with a legacy of huge debts?\" he said. \"We have a responsibility to act. We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.\" The prime minister's choice of the Enterprise Zone - on the Boots industrial campus on the edge of Nottingham - was no coincidence. It was one of the first set up by the coalition four years ago. Its offer of regulation light touch and tax concessions has resulted in 30 companies (specialising in well-being and beauty products) and 80 jobs. The East Midlands also has a strong economic story for the PM. The governor of the Bank of England last year described the region as the \"bellwether\" of the UK economy. David Cameron went one further and described the region as the \"firing engine\" of the country's economic revival.

He was killed while defending Canada against an invasion by the United States of America at the Battle of Queenston Heights in 1812. The portrait will be displayed in the Riverbrink Art Museum in Ontario. It is thought to have been created by the Dutch artist Gerrit Schipper around 1808-09, when Sir Isaac was in Canada. The military chief led the defence of Upper Canada after America declared war on Britain in 1812. He was responsible for the capture of Detroit, and was shot midway through the battle of Queenston Heights while reinforcing a charge. The battle was the largest clash of the war up to that point, and ended with much of the American militia being forced to surrender when cut off from the rest of the army.

He was killed on Friday in an attack in the Iraqi capital Baghdad ordered by US President Donald Trump. The killing has sparked concerns of a wider conflict, with Iran vowing \"severe revenge\". Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Tehran for the funeral of 62-year-old Soleimani, who headed the elite Quds Force and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East. Many mourners held up photos of Soleimani, with some even wearing clothes bearing his image. The coffins of Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who also died in the US strike in Baghdad, were passed over the heads of mourners. Supreme Leader Khamenei was joined by top political and military figures in Iran in paying respects to the commander. Here, Mr Khamenei (centre) stands alongside Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (third from left) and other officials next to Soleimani's coffin. Mr Khamenei wept as he read a prayer. Esmail Ghaani, who has replaced Soleimani as the commander of the Quds Force, kissed the coffins of those killed in the drone strike. The streets were filled with smoke as mourners burned incense during the funeral procession. Some people set fire to US and Israeli flags. Others carried mock coffins decorated with the flags of the two countries, and pictures of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

A Newsnight report had led to Thatcher-era Tory Lord McAlpine being wrongly accused of child abuse.

Lord Patten, appearing before the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said Mr Entwistle had asked him if the BBC Trust - the corporation's governing body - was \"urging him to go\". He was told: \"We are not urging you to go. But we are not urging you to stay.\" Lord Patten said Mr Entwistle and his lawyers insisted he would not leave with six months pay and he said the director general had asked for more than the 12 months pay he eventually got. \"He wanted to go on 12 months and more,\" he told the committee. Questioned about how much Mr Entwistle had asked for, he said: \"He didn't ask for two years but he did ask for more.\" Lord Patten said there had been feverish negotiation on 11 November and he took advice from the BBC's lawyers. He said they told him that if the pay-off deal was refused, Mr Entwistle could go to an industrial tribunal and would stand to win an extra \u00a380,000 on top of the \u00a3450,000. Lord Patten said: \"We did not have grounds for dismissal. We could either accept a consensual deal for 12 months, or the situation would drift on and we would find ourselves with a constructive dismissal (claim) and also an unfair dismissal.\" He also said that if Mr Entwistle was found to have done anything in breach of his contract, \"we can claw back some of the remunerations that has been paid\".

General Sir Richard Dannatt, head of the Army from 2006-9, said change was needed because existing forces' training facilities were rundown. Gen Dannatt predicted the base would go ahead, but on a smaller scale. Earlier this month Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said she remained supportive of the St Athan plan, but was unable to say if it would proceed while examinations of spending proposals continued. Welsh MPs from across the political parties have campaigned for the academy to proceed. Alun Cairns, Conservative MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, said it should go ahead \"because it is the best military thing to do\". 'Very tricky' The project was originally envisaged as centralising training for the three armed forces, and funded by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) as a private finance initiative (PFI). General Dannatt told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: \"This is a very tricky one. \"This has been the policy for 10 years now: to have a single big defence academy and St Athan is the site that has been selected. \"There really is no plan B because the existing training facilities which the three services are using are very rundown and there has got to be a change.\" Gen Dannatt, who has just published his autobiography, Leading from the Front, added: \"So I think this PFI-based solution is the one which will go ahead. \"Maybe it won't be as large, maybe it won't be quite as ambitious as previously. \"I think it's a very difficult issue and one of the key ones on the non-equipment side that the MoD is going to have to grapple with.\"\n\nSummary:","275":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The demands of those demonstrating are wide-ranging and include making access to education more accessible. The two sides are due to meet again on Thursday but so far little progress has been made in talks between them. 'They keep killing us' The committee representing the protesters has handed President Duque a list of 13 demands. Among them are that the government fully meet its obligations under the terms of the peace process signed with the left-wing rebels of the Farc in 2016, and that it do more to prevent the killings of social activists and former rebels. Some of the protesters accuse President Duque, who opposed the peace agreement, of trying to undermine it. The committee also wants assurances that the pension age will not be raised and that the minimum wage will not be cut for young people. President Duque denies having plans to change either and says the protesters are being manipulated by his political rivals. Following the death of one young protester after he was hit by a projectile fired by riot police, the committee is also calling for that force to be dismantled. Eighteen-year-old Dilan Cruz died after he was hit on the head by a beanbag round, a fabric sack filled with lead shot. President Duque has ruled out disbanding the riot police force. He has also called for a \"great national dialogue\" to discuss the protesters' demands, but the committee behind the protests has demanded that the talks be solely between it and the government as it fears having other groups represented would \"water them down\". On Wednesday, indigenous groups again joined in the protests in the capital, Bogot\u00e1.

She had 19 rib fractures and a serious head injury, the inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court heard. The coroner said Haringey children's services' decision to discharge the baby was \"utterly bewildering\". The court heard Lily-Mai was born premature and had spent the first two months of her life in Barnet Hospital. At the time she was discharged into her parents' care on 25 January 2018, healthcare professionals had raised concerns about Lily-Mai being sent home to her parents, Lauren Saint George and Darren Hurrell. 'Feeling of anxiety' Sithembile Dzingai, who dealt with allocating health visitors, said healthcare professionals had raised concern as the parents did not visit or call to check on Lily-Mai's condition for three or four days while she was in hospital. A referral was made to a social worker, Ms Dzingai said, adding there were concerns with the baby being discharged with \"no robust plan in place to support the parents\". \"In my 12 years as a health visitor I've never had such feeling of anxiety about a case as I did about Lily-Mai being discharged in this way, because there were a number of concerns,\" she said.

Mr Kagame has previously made similar allegations, which France has denied. The French foreign ministry said the remarks went against reconciliation efforts between the two countries. French Justice Minister Christiane Taubira has cancelled her plans to attend the events in Kigali on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman Romain Nadal says. Speaking to the French-language weekly news magazine Jeune Afrique, Mr Kagame denounced the \"direct role of Belgium and France in the political preparation for the genocide\". Rwanda was a Belgian colony until 1962. In the interview, due to be published on Sunday but carried out on 27 March, Mr Kagame is quoted as saying that, 20 years on, \"the only plausible reproach in [France's] eyes is in not having done enough to save lives during the genocide\". It comes as Rwanda prepares to mark the 20th anniversary of the atrocities that claimed at least 800,000 lives - mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus - over a period of about 100 days. The violence was triggered by the death of President Juvenal Habyarimana, an ethnic Hutu who was killed when his plane was shot down on 6 April 1994. The genocide came to an end after Mr Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) - a Tutsi-led rebel group - defeated government troops in July that year. His party still controls the government and has long accused France - an ally of Mr Habyarimana's government at the time - of aiding the genocide. In recent years there has been a thaw in relations between the two countries, with a visit by Mr Kagame to Paris in 2011 and the establishment by France of a genocide investigation unit.

The Royal College of Nursing blamed the 23% drop in nursing applications on the removal of bursaries. Universities Minister Jo Johnson said that despite the overall drop, more 18-year-olds were applying to university. These Ucas admissions figures, up to the January deadline for courses starting in the autumn, show a 5% drop in UK students and 7% drop in students from the European Union - with a total of about 564,000. Universities have been warning about the impact of Brexit on their finances if European applications fall and these figures show a significant decline in candidates from the EU. Competing for students There has also been a decline in UK students applying - and like the two previous occasions when applications have fallen - this has been when fees are being increased. The fall in applications in England of 6% has been three times greater than in Scotland at 2%, which remains without tuition fees. Applications from Wales fell most, by 7%, and Northern Ireland by 5%. Nursing had the biggest fall of any individual subject, and Janet Davies, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, blamed this on the switch from grants to fees and loans. \"We warned the government the removal of student funding would see a sharp drop in nursing applications. These figures confirm our worst fears,\" said Ms Davies. She said the \"nursing workforce is in crisis\". But there were drops across other subjects - particularly among older students not applying directly from school. Among 19-year-olds, numbers were down 9%. And among 25-year-olds, applications were down 23%. But among 18-year-olds, such as sixth-formers applying from school, numbers have continued to rise to record levels, up to 37% of the age group.

'Dead anyway' He added: \"She doesn't know who anyone is. She is in agony. She was dead anyway. She was gone as far as I was concerned.\" Police recovered a Jansport backpack from the scene containing one bread knife and one kitchen knife measuring 8cm. Three psychiatrists have since said that in separate meetings, Jennings showed behaviour \"consistent with paranoid schizophrenia\" including \"psychosis, moments of paranoia, delusions and bizarre beliefs\". Forest Place is home to about 100 residents and three supporting units. Mrs Wilson moved there on 30 May 2017. Defending, Dorian Lovell-Pank QC said Jennings' family knew he was \"ill\" and they were \"deeply concerned\" about his mental health. The trial continues.

But the analysis methods that private companies use put it at \u00a310.5bn. There are concerns that such a significant hole in what is the biggest pension fund in the country could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, with 303,000 members, has assets of \u00a337.9bn - more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. By its own official estimate to members this month, that is \u00a37.9bn short of what it needs to pay pensions. Those numbers are disputed by the fund's critics who say that working it out on the formula private companies use - known as FRS17 - would put it at \u00a32.6bn higher. 'Degree of denial' Analysis for Newsnight by pensions consultant John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, showed that to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to \u00a31.8bn. That equates to a rise in tuition fees of up to \u00a31,000 a year. Mr Ralfe said: \"There is a whole degree of denial. USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. \"We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. \"There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we're doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children.\" Higher Education Minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students. \"Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits,\" he said. \"It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits to support pension schemes that are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they're older.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the umbrella body Universities UK, said\n\nSummary:","287":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The chosen commissions include a film about Tilbury's disused station and an LGBT rambling club for the coast. The East Contemporary Visual Arts Network (ECVAN) described the winners as a \"cohesive group of artists\". Last year, ECVAN asked for ideas from across Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk to inspire visual art. The Arts Council England-funded project - known as New Geographies - was designed to give \"an opportunity to encounter excellent art in unexpected places\" delivered by the end of 2019. The artists chosen include Brighton-based David Blandy, who will create a work with the flora and fauna of Canvey Island based on Dungeons & Dragons, and Cooking Sections, who will base a work about flood risk in response to the concrete \"pyramid\" structures in the sea off Great Yarmouth. Donna Lynas, ECVAN chairwoman, said artists responded to the locations \"with their own personal histories and narratives\". \"We have a cohesive group of artists who make a strong statement about valuing people as the starting point for art commissioning, with many different approaches\". The project - using \u00a3600,000 of Arts Council funding - also involves nine galleries and museums across the region.

On the one hand the vote had been won in 1918 (for those aged over 30) and the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act of 1919 had removed most barriers to the professions. On the other hand, there was entrenched discrimination such as unequal pay and enforced retirement on marriage - the Marriage Bar - in occupations such as teaching and the civil service. The adage \"a woman's place is in the home\" was true for most women, once they were married. So who were the women who came to work at the early BBC? When it was founded at the close of 1922, broadcasting in Britain was virtually unknown. Those who arrived at Savoy Hill, the BBC's home until 1932, were part of a brand new industry, toiling together to get the first broadcast schedules on air. Few were actual producers, most worked behind the scenes, with women providing the vital secretarial and clerical support. As one official wryly observed \"the telephones never stopped ringing, the typewriters never stopped clicking, the duplicating machines duplicated for dear life\". It was the birth of broadcasting. Because the BBC was brand new there were no set employment practices, unlike teaching and the civil service, two of the most common occupations for middle-class women in the 1920s. In 1926, John Reith, the BBC's managing director, issued a statement declaring that women should be \"on the same footing as men\", with the same chances for promotion. Women were on the same salary scales as men, and there was no Marriage Bar, at least not until 1932. Even then, the BBC made allowances for exceptional women to remain on the staff list. In 1939, the three highest earning women - Mary Somerville (director of school broadcasting), Mary Adams (television producer) and Barbara Burnham (drama producer) - were all married. Mary Somerville and Mary Adams were also both mothers.

Defence Minister Guto Bebb resigned so he could vote against the government. MPs will carry on debating Brexit on Tuesday when the Trade Bill comes to the Commons. It gives the government the power to build new trade relationships around the world after the UK leaves the EU, and MPs who support staying in the EU's customs union are seeking to change its wording. Critics said the amendments to the Customs Bill laid down by Eurosceptics on Monday would undermine the UK's recently-announced negotiating position. But Downing Street, which agreed earlier to accept the four amendments, said they were \"consistent\" with the White Paper where it sets out how it wants to trade with the EU in years to come. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate. This was underlined on Monday as it first accepted a series of demands from Brexiteers who are unhappy at the proposals in the White Paper, believing it keeps the UK too closely tied to the EU. But this angered MPs from the party's pro-EU wing who refused to back the new amendments, leading to heated exchanges in the House of Commons as the Customs Bill was debated. Tory MP and Remainer Heidi Allen said she wished the prime minister had \"faced down the amendments.\" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What was agreed at Chequers wasn't perfect to us, wasn't perfect to Leavers either, but I think the prime minister had worked exceptionally hard to find a decent first pitch to put to the EU and move forward from that. \"We were all set [on the Remain side] to drop all our amendments and back it, then suddenly we had these rather extreme last minute manoeuvres, which seem to us to deviate th\n\nSummary:","292":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

On Saturday, the renovated Coniston Institute will open its doors with a whole new lease of life. It will be a living, working celebration of the community and the arts and crafts fraternity which began when the artist, writer and social reformer John Ruskin moved to the area in 1852. The Coniston community is only about 600 strong and is aiming for an openness and honesty that is being reflected in the institute and its new arts provisions. In its hey-day, it provided for \"an ideal education with reading room, bathhouse, assembly hall, library, theatre, billiard room, kitchen, art and craft studios and a collection of books, artefacts and art\". Honesty - the best policy Today, through the collective efforts of Coniston residents and Grizedale Arts, the institute houses a new public library, new kitchens, indoor markets and the restoration of the reading room. It also has a community-run village \"honest shop\". \"We had been running honest stalls in the village for some time,\" said Alistair Hudson, deputy director of Grizedale Arts, \"and this seemed like a natural extension. \"We have had a soft launch for a couple of months and we've already taken around \u00a33,000. \"This is a shop to which a wide range of local suppliers bring almost anything from frozen farm meat, vegetables, paintings, and the like and they are all sold in an honest manner,\" he added.

It has already put 15% to 25% tariffs on $7.5bn worth of other EU goods as part of the dispute. The EU warned it would damage firms on both side of the Atlantic. And UK Trade Minister Liz Truss said she was disappointed by the move, warning against the use of \"tit-for-tat\" tariffs. The row centres on EU subsidies given to Airbus before 2004, which Washington says created an unfair advantage over the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing. Last year, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled the subsidies were illegal and allowed the US to levy tariffs on EU goods, including aircraft, wines and cheese. But it is now considering a parallel case involving illegal support for Boeing, which could see the EU imposing duties later this year. The US said pastry and cakes, gin, cashmere clothes and hardware products could all be in the firing line for new tariffs, affecting exporters across the continent. In a statement the EU said Washington was going beyond what was allowed by the WTO. \"It creates uncertainty for companies and inflicts unnecessary economic damage on both sides of the Atlantic,\" it added. \"This is particularly the case as companies are now trying to overcome the economic difficulties in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis.\" 'Suffered enough' Since 2017, the US has been embroiled in a damaging trade war with China, which it accuses of unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. However, it has also trained it fire on allies including the EU.

He will remain at liberty until a French court hears an appeal lodged by his lawyer. PIP's sale of faulty implants caused a global health scare which affected about 300,000 women in 65 countries. The company was found to have used sub-standard silicone gel - rather than medical-grade silicone - which the result that many implants ruptured. Apart from Mas, four other former PIP executives were convicted and given lesser sentences. With more than 5,000 women registered as plaintiffs in the case, and about 300 lawyers, the trial was considered one of the biggest in French legal history. The health scare came to public attention in 2011 when the French government recommended that women have PIP implants removed due to an abnormally high rupture rate. There was confusion as British health authorities said there was no need for routine removal. However, they later agreed to remove the implants to put women's minds at rest. The issue of whether the sub-standard silicone used in the implants posed any danger was not resolved by the trial, AFP news agency notes. 'Under-reported' Mas, 74, showed no sign of emotion as sentence was passed. His lawyer, Yves Haddad, blamed the severity of the sentence on pressure generated by the media, and said he would appeal, meaning that Mas will remain at liberty until the outcome of a further hearing.

But some patients have not yet received those letters. The Royal College of GPs apologised for the delay, saying the letters would be sent \"as soon as possible\". The Health and Social Care Board said GPs had been asked to use their own clinical judgement to identify \"extremely vulnerable\" patients. A spokesperson said it was a \"complicated process\". Dr Alan Stout, from the British Medical Association NI, said it was \"a big ask of GPs during a very difficult and busy time\". But he said there was an urgency to the project, which is UK-wide, and said \"these letters are very important and go to our most vulnerable and at risk group of patients\". \"The only way to obtain an accurate list and contact details of these patients was through the GP computer system [and] GPs would be able to readily identify and know any patient that might have been missed,\" he added. Dr Laurence Dorman, RCGP chairman, said \"shielding was a big deal\" and said any delays were due to the fact \"doctors want to do this right\". He said staffing levels in some GP surgeries had been \"hit hard by Covid-19\", which had affected their ability to fulfil requirements.

But 9% of undergraduates were unsatisfied, the same percentage as last year, while a further 8% were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. The survey comes as students in England starting degree courses in 2012 face tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year. The findings, which are published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), were based on answers from students studying at 154 universities and 99 further education colleges across the UK. There was a response rate of 65% - the highest rate in the seven years that the NSS has been running. Feedback complaints The poll revealed that about a third of students (32%) were unhappy with the level of assessment and feedback they received, while a quarter (25%) criticised the organisation and management of their course. Among universities only, students at Brighton and Sussex Medical School were the happiest, with an overall satisfaction rate of 95%. Cambridge University was second with 94% of students happy overall. The private Buckingham University, the Open University (which is listed as England), Oxford, St Andrews and St Mary's University College Belfast, all had satisfaction rates of 93%.

An illegally-released population has also been discovered in Tayside. Both groups will be allowed to expand naturally but will be managed to protect farmers and land owners. Native Scottish beavers were hunted to extinction in the 16th century. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham explained the Scottish government's decision to grant beavers protected status. \"Beavers promote biodiversity by creating new ponds and wetlands, which in turn provide valuable habitats for a wide range of other species,\" she said. \"We want to realise these biodiversity benefits while limiting adverse impacts on farmers and other land users. This will require careful management.\" 'Criminal act' Ms Cunningham said she wanted to \"be absolutely clear\" that while the beaver populations in Argyll and Tayside would be allowed to extend their range naturally, \"further unauthorised releases of beavers\" would be treated as \"a criminal act\". \"Swift action will be taken in such circumstances to prevent a repeat of the experience on Tayside,\" she said. The two lead partners in the 2009 Scottish Beaver Trial - the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and the Scottish Wildlife Trust - have both welcomed the Scottish government's decision. Zoological Society chief executive, Barbara Smith, said it was \"a truly historic day for Scottish conservation\". \"Returning a keystone species to the wild for the first time in 400 years is a tremendous achievement... and we welcome the government's commitment to the species both in Knapdale and further afield,\" she said. \"Establishing a clear and comprehensive management plan for the species should now be our top priority.\" Jonathan Hughes, chief executive of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, described the development as \"a major milestone for Scotland's wildlife and the wider conservation movement\".

Curiosity has previously drilled into three rocks to collect powdered tailings for analysis in its sophisticated onboard laboratories. This latest acquisition should give scientists a taster for the type of sediments that lie ahead. The Nasa rover is driving into the nearby foothills of Mount Sharp, a 5km peak at the centre of Mars' Gale Crater. Researchers hope the chemistry of the rocks at the base of this mountain will reveal new details about the environmental history of Mars. Already, the one-tonne robot has established that a lake and rivers were present on the floor of Gale billions of years ago. Scientists say conditions during those ancient times could have supported micro-organisms - had they been present. Curiosity has spent much of the past year simply driving, trying to get to Mount Sharp, which was always intended to be its primary mission target. Wednesday's operation followed a small test hole that was sunk in the Pahrump mudstone on Sunday to check its stability. Drilling a deeper, 6cm hole has the effect of pushing pulverised rock particles up into a collection chamber. After being sifted and sieved, a pinch of this material can then dropped into the labs housed in Curiosity's belly. The mission team is hopeful that the Pahrump sample will have a high silica (silicon) content - something the robot has seen in other rocks in recent weeks when probing their chemistry with spectrometers. This would support other indications that the local sediments were laid down in the presence of abundant water. After two years on the planet, Curiosity has reached what the US space agency says is a critical juncture in its mission. It is now moving off the rocks that make up the crater floor and on to a geological unit known as the Murray Formation. Pahrump is its first chance to sample material in this form\n\nSummary:","305":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

If they're lucky, they will get a valuable insight into the world of employment. If they're not, they can look forward to hours spent making tea and photocopying. The work experience placement has become almost a guaranteed rite of passage in an increasingly competitive job market. To many employers this is a welcome development, allowing them to screen potential new recruits and ensure that new workers have a basic grasp of workplace dynamics before they clock on for the first time. But to critics, interns are nothing more than a vast army of unpaid labour - and the expectation in many industries that they will be prepared to work for free means it is largely those from privileged backgrounds who benefit. Whatever your take, there is little doubt that work experience has an increasingly large impact on what will be the job prospects for many young people. Some 21.7% of summer 2009 graduates who were in employment six months later had been taken on by an employer with whom they had previously had some kind of work experience, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). For the first time they represented the largest group of university leavers. As a result, this summer will see many young people taking time out from their studies by making their first excursions into office life - if they calculate the traditional bar, shop or fruit-picking job will not now look impressive enough as they forge their future careers.

It is believed she suffered two cardiac arrests after the procedure to enlarge her breasts from a 70F to a 70G (UK: 34F to 34G).

She wasn't there, and I was very passionate about Cleopatra.\" Controversy erupted in October after Gadot announced that she would star in and co-produce the film. The Guardian's Hanna Flint called it \"a backwards step for Hollywood representation\", while director Lexi Alexander said a black actress should be cast, citing a reconstruction of Cleopatra's face. Gadot said: \"I have friends from across the globe, whether they're Muslims or Christian or Catholic or atheist or Buddhist, or Jewish of course... People are people, and with me I want to celebrate the legacy of Cleopatra and honour this amazing historic icon that I admire so much.\" She said other people were welcome to make their own films. \"You know, anybody can make this movie and anybody can go ahead and do it. I'm very passionate that I'm going to do my own too.\" Cleopatra - Macedonian or Egyptian? Cleopatra, born in the ancient Egyptian capital Alexandria, was the last ruler in the dynasty founded by Alexander the Great's Macedonian general Ptolemy, whose descendants ruled Egypt for 300 years. They have long been thought to have been white with a high degree of inbreeding. But there is mystery over the identity of her mother, leading to speculation that Cleopatra may have been of mixed heritage.

The tenth anniversary iPhone, which retails for \u00a3999, is Apple's most expensive handset yet. Analysts said Apple was now closer to becoming the first trillion dollar company, as shares rose 2%. The California-based firm, which also sells computers, iPads and makes revenue from apps, is now valued at nearly $900bn (\u00a3690bn). With iPhone 8 and X handsets now on sale, Mr Cook predicted Apple's \"biggest quarter ever\" in the three months to the end of the year. Shoppers queued up at Apple stores in dozens of countries, as the high-end iPhone X launched on Friday. The iPhone X abandons the signature \"home\" button and can be unlocked with face-scanning technology, among other new features. \"A trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cook's sights in light of these results and guidance around iPhone X,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights. Mr Cook said the company was \"firing on all cylinders\", thanks to a sales rebound in China, record purchases through the App Store and robust demand for its latest iPhone models. It sold more than 46.6 million phones in the July to September period, up 3% year-on-year. That produced $28.8bn, or more than half of its revenue. Other products, including the Mac, iPad and Apple Watch, also did well, growing in the double digits. The firm got another boost from its services division, which includes the App store, Apple Pay and its music subscriptions service.

But organisers say the lyrics do not make specific reference to Apple's app. \"The lyrics of the Australian song are presented as two separate words, 'face time' and not FaceTime which is an Apple trademark,\" said the Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group, which rules on such disputes. \"The Merriam-Webster dictionary refers to 'face time' as 'time spent meeting with someone'... so in this case the song lyrics have been cleared.\" New lyrics In previous years, entrants have been forced to rewrite songs which fell foul of the Eurovision rulebook. San Marino's 2012 entry, Facebook Uh, Oh, Oh (A Satirical Song) was renamed The Social Network Song (Oh Oh Uh Oh Oh) after organisers intervened. And in 2005, Ukraine had to rewrite the lyrics to Razom Nas Bagato!, which had become the anthem of the country's \"orange revolution\" a year earlier.

Shortly after, it emerged that the death of a worker at a Foxconn plant in China's Hebei province earlier this year was also a suicide. A total of 11 Foxconn employees in China have tried to kill themselves this year - two have survived. The incidents have raised concerns about worker treatment at the site. The Associated Press quoted spokesman Arthur Huang as saying the company carried out social responsibility programmes to ensure workers' welfare. Earlier this week, Foxconn said it was enlisting counsellors and Buddhist monks to provide emotional support for its workers. Suicides Ten of the employees worked at Foxconn's campuses in Shenzhen, but on Friday it was revealed that a man who died at a factory in the northern Hebei province had also jumped from a building. The worker, identified by Xinhua as 19-year old Rong Bo, died in the city of Langtang early this year. A similar investigation into the death of 16-year old Wang Lingyan - who was found dead in a dormitory at the same site - concluded she died from cardiac arrest, government spokeswoman Wang Qiunu told Xinhua.

A couple of decades later, people could catch a passenger flight to London, Cardiff, Birmingham and beyond. With a population of just over 5,300 at the last Census, the town, in the historic county of Radnorshire, is an unlikely spot for an air travel hub. Why Llandrindod Wells? In part, because municipal leaders had big ambitions for the town, according to local historian Phillip Jones. \"Llandrindod had an extremely progressive and outward-thinking local council, who before most others, foresaw the potential for air travel to increase the relevance of isolated towns like theirs,\" he said. Mr Jones, author of Early Birds and Boys in Blue: A Century of Flight in Radnorshire, added: \"By 1913 they'd invited renowned pilot Gustav Hamel to carry out a demonstration over what was then little more than a cut strip in a field, and after that the town's reputation was established as the Welsh centre for aviation, before Cardiff and Swansea had even got out of the blocks.\" The driving force behind the move was local councillor Tom Norton. The automobile entrepreneur branched out into selling aeroplanes from his dealership, and to this day the word \"Aircraft\" can be seen on the front of the town's Automobile Palace building. The 1920s and 1930s were the heyday of exhibition flying in Britain as the number of trained pilots and aircraft engineers shot up following World War One. One of those pioneering aviators was Sir Alan Cobham, who flew the first plane from London to Cape Town in 1926. In 1932 Tom Norton managed to attract \"Cobham's Flying Circus\" to Llandrindod. A year later a taxi service began, flying two passengers per trip to London and back for \u00a310 and 10 shillings - about \u00a3740 in today's money. \"It wasn't cheap, probably the equivalent of a workingman's weekly wage per passenger, but it put Llandrindod Wells on the map,\" added Mr Jones. \"Fo\n\nSummary:","319":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The ABC has called 68 seats for the ruling Liberal-National coalition, 67 seats for Labor and five for independents and minor parties. The count was progressing slowly on Tuesday and it is possible the result will not be known for several more days as large numbers of absentee and postal votes are processed. Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull urged to quit Cartoon: Planet of Forbidden Prime Ministers Are Australians ready to gamble on yet another PM?

But he said the fact the \"scare campaign\" gained traction showed voters believed the government was capable of such actions. \"What we have to recognise is that many Australians were troubled by it, believed it or at least had anxieties raised by it,\" Mr Turnbull said.\n\nSummary:","321":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He also promised to drop all his TV and music work. It comes a day after superstar Seungri from the group Big Bang quit the industry after he was charged with sex bribery. Jung, who is accused of taping 10 or more women, is due to be questioned by Seoul Metropolitan Police on Thursday. \"I filmed women without their consent and shared it in a chatroom, and while I was doing so I didn't feel a great sense of guilt,\" said Jung in the statement released late on Tuesday. It came after South Korean broadcaster SBS reported allegations that he had filmed his own sex videos without his partners' permission, and shared them with friends in a mobile chat group during 2015-16. He apologised to the fans he had \"outraged\", and to the women whose privacy he violated. \"Throughout the rest of my life, I will repent on my immoral and illegal acts that constitute crimes,\" he said. \"I will faithfully cooperate with an investigation by police that will start on Thursday and I will readily accept whatever punishment is in store for me.\" This is not the first time Jung has been accused of filming a sexual encounter without consent. An ex-girlfriend made an allegation against him in 2016, but ultimately withdrew it. The singer-songwriter, best known for his part in a variety show, claimed she had agreed to the filming. South Korea has been fighting an epidemic of \"spy cam porn\" in recent years. Hidden cameras are sometimes placed in toilets and changing rooms, then uploaded online without the knowledge of victims. The country saw more than 6,000 cases reported in 2017 alone.

Work on her home and materials were paid by the charity, it was claimed. Mrs Beard, of Henllan, Denbighshire, and her husband James, 46, deny fraud and theft. She is alleged to have \"milked\" the charity of more than \u00a354,000 by dishonestly diverting money for her own benefit and that of her family, prosecutor Karl Scholz said. He said that in November 2008, a \"Plas Madoc Got Talent\" competition was organised at the local leisure centre. Her husband acted as compere and the celebrity judges were her son, model Darrell Kelly, and his partner Sinead Moynihan, a Hollyoaks actress. Midnight Mr Scholz alleged that a reservation was made for Mrs Beard at The Wild Pheasant, Llangollen, that night and the bill, including meals and drinks, came to \u00a3260. It was invoiced to and paid for by the charity although the event finished at 22:00 GMT and she was not due to attend work the next day, it was alleged. A further booking was made for two adults at the same hotel in February 2009. Once there, she extended the booking for two nights and the total cost was \u00a3713, again billed to the Communities First project. The court was told she denied that she stayed there with her husband, but when shown an invoice which said they had been the guests, she said \"whether I stayed there alone or not, it's the same price\". The jury also heard how bills for materials for a home extension had been put through the charity.

The socially-distanced trail will raise money for The Grand Appeal, the Bristol Children's Hospital Charity. It will include new designs as well as favourites from previous trails. Creations in the sculpture show, called Gromit Unleashed: The Grand Adventure, will each represent a different country. They will be located out of reach to minimise the risk of virus transmission, and \"selfie spots\" will be marked to encourage people to keep their distance from others. An online digital tour of all the sculptures will also be available via the appeal's website.

The force said it made nine arrests in total, serving all but one with a \u00a3200 fixed penalty notice. Officers had asked the demonstrators to move on, said a spokesperson, but \"some did not listen\". That led to the arrests and subsequent fining of three women aged 21, 41 and 58, and five men aged between 19 and 58. Police said a 20-year-old man from Leicester, arrested on suspicion of organising a large gathering in breach of Covid-19 restrictions, had been bailed. \"Although under normal circumstances we accept and protect people's right to protest, under current legislation, attending a protest is not considered an exception to leaving your house and is unlawful,\" Ch Supt Kim Madill said on Saturday. The force initially said 11 people had been arrested but since confirmed the number was nine. It added that further to the demonstration proceedings, officers patrolling the city centre on Saturday issued 25 fixed penalty notices \"to members of the public failing to follow the rules\".

Scientists say this flow of water plays an important role in helping to regulate the Earth's climate system. Boaty made a total of three dives, reaching down to 4,000m below the surface. And by all accounts, it acquired a remarkable set of new data. \"We were extremely pleased with Boaty's performance,\" said Prof Alberto Naveira-Garabato from the University of Southampton, the lead scientist for the investigations conducted from the deck of the Royal Research Ship James Clark Ross. \"Boaty's longest dive was over three days, covering 180km. Boaty flew through some very strong currents, very close to the ocean bottom and encountered some really steep terrain. And it did this while running through a very complex sampling pattern.\" Boaty carries the name that a public poll had suggested be given to the UK's future \u00a3200m polar research vessel. The government felt this would be inappropriate and directed the humorous moniker go on a submersible instead (the ship will be called the RSS Sir David Attenborough). Southampton's National Oceanography Centre (NOC) - the home of Boaty - is actually going to use the brand on three robots in its new Autosub Long Range class. These subs have proven their capabilities in various sea trials but the Antarctic venture was the first full science expedition, proper. Boaty was programmed to swim through a narrow gap in the ocean-floor ridge that extends northeast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Known as the Orkney Passage, this opening is a critical \"valve\" in the so-called \"great ocean conveyor\" - the relentless system of deep circulation that helps redistribute all the heat energy that has built up in the climate system.

An image of remote Loch Ossian taken using a \"point-and-shoot\" camera given to Andrew as a Christmas present was shortlisted in the Scottish Nature Photography Awards, and published in the awards' yearbook. To encourage this new interest in photography, Andrew was given a 10-year-old digital camera by his father Grant. His dad asked that he set the camera to manual and then learn how to use it. Andrew has not looked back since and, now 17, has racked up a trove of awards along the way. They include runner-up and category prizes in Scottish and UK-wide photography awards. A photograph taken during a powerful display of the Aurora Borealis earned Andrew the UK Take-A-View Young Landscape Photographer of the Year Award. He and his family had headed to Musselburgh to get a better view of the Northern Lights. They came across a deserted skate park and the teenager photographed it with the aurora in the background. A picture of a football pitch in Eriskay in the Western Isles has drawn international attention to Andrew's work. The image taken on a \"grim day\" of weather won him a prize in the Scottish Nature Photography Awards, the title of Young Scottish Landscape Photographer of the Year and a phone call from football's international governing body Fifa. Fifa has described Eriskay's pitch as one of the eight most unique places in the world to play football. Staff at Fifa spotted Andrew's photograph and called to ask if it could be featured on their social media accounts. Andrew, who has played football since primary school, was delighted. Requests to buy prints have also arrived from as far afield as Indiana in the US. The teenager continues to juggle his photography with school studies and playing football.

The Scottish government has committed to putting \u00a32bn of funding into the bank over the next decade. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the bank \"has the potential to transform Scotland's society\" and build a \"high-tech, inclusive economy\". The legislation passed by MSPs grants the necessary powers to set up the bank as a publicly listed company. Its primary goal is to help Scotland transition to net-zero carbon emissions, while supporting small and medium-size enterprises. Mr Mackay told MSPs that the bank would eventually be financially independent, and would be \"commercially minded and also publicly accountable to the people of Scotland\". He said: \"The bank's primary mission will be to face up to the global climate emergency by accelerating the just transition to net-zero carbon emissions. Harnessing private sector activity to achieve this has never been more important. \"We know from the experience of other countries that national investment banks can deliver real change, but this impact will not be delivered overnight. It will require determination, patience and support from partners right across Scotland.\" Parties unanimously backed the setting up of the bank, but said there had been a \"missed opportunity\" after a series of opposition amendments were rejected. Scottish Labour wanted the bank to have 10 times as much government funding as is currently proposed, with finance spokeswoman Rhoda Grant saying the \"relatively small amount of money that will be made available\" meant \"the bank will be a shadow of the high-investment, ethical bank that we have campaigned for\". The Scottish Greens said it was \"very disappointing\" that their amendments adding climate change commitments to the bill were voted down.

The three-day event usually sees gaming giants including Sony and Microsoft showcase their newest, shiniest products. In a statement, Sony said: \"We always want to innovate, think differently and experiment with new ways to delight gamers.\" Sony went on to say: \"PlayStation fans mean the world to us. \"We are exploring new and familiar ways to engage our community in 2019 and can't wait to share our plans. \"As a result, we have decided not to participate in E3 in 2019.\" Around 70,000 people attend the E3 event this year. Normally, Sony would hold a press conference and have a booth at the event - which takes place next year in Los Angeles, California, on 11 June. Its decision not to show up in 2019 has left mixed feelings among fans and experts. This isn't the first event Sony have cancelled this year. In September, Sony boss Shawn Layden announced the company's annual event, PlayStation Experience, was to be cancelled. The reason - PlayStation didn't have enough games to show its players. PlayStation Experience started in 2014 as a celebration for PlayStation's 20th anniversary as a way to unite its fans. Mr Layden said: \"We don't want to set expectations really high and then not deliver on it. \"It was a hard decision.\" There's hope however for some new development from Sony for its PlayStation gamers. Sony president Kenichiro Yoshida announced earlier this year the company was developing a new video game console - which many gamers suspect to be the PlayStation 5. He told the Financial Times that it was \"necessary to have a next-generation hardware\". However, he declined to say whether the successor would be branded the PlayStation 5.

He described the accord as a bad deal and said his pro fossil fuel policies had made the US an energy superpower. The earliest he can formally start the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris accord is 4 November. The pull-out will take effect a year later - the day after the 2020 US presidential election. The Paris agreement brought together 195 nations in the battle to combat climate change. It committed the US to cutting greenhouse gases up to 28% by 2025 based on 2005 levels. President Trump said if he couldn\u2019t improve that deal he\u2019d pull out, but diplomatic sources said there\u2019s been no major effort at renegotiation. A seek-and-destroy mission In the meantime, the president\u2019s staff have conducted what critics call a seek-and-destroy mission through US environmental legislation. Mr Trump promised that he\u2019d turn the US into an energy superpower, and he\u2019s attempting to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He categorised former US President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. The gas and oil industries are indeed thriving, but Mr Trump\u2019s pledge to resurrect the coal industry has proved much more challenging. Coal can't compete on price with gas - or, for that matter, with renewables whose costs have plummeted. Firms are also reluctant to invest billions in coal-fired plants which could have a limited life if the next administration rejoins the rest of the world on climate change. As coal is the dirtiest fuel, the industry\u2019s woes have held down US emissions, despite the President\u2019s policies. What\u2019s more, many US states, cities and businesses remain committed to the Paris Agreement, whatever Mr Trump does.

The men were trapped by a cave-in at a gypsum mine in eastern Shandong province on 25 December. Of 29 initially trapped, 15 have been rescued and one is confirmed dead, while 13 are still missing. The footage, released by Chinese authorities, showed miners named as Hua Mingxi, 36, Zhao Zhicheng, 50, Li Qiusheng, 39, and Guan Qinji, 58, addressing rescuers. \"Thank you all very much, I feel relieved and secure now,\" says one man through his tears. \"We will remember you all forever,\" says another. The phone had been sent down some days earlier with video of the rescue operation, in order to give the men hope. More than 400 rescue workers were involved in the operation to reach the men, who were trapped more than 200m (656ft) underground. A borehole was drilled down to the shaft and water and liquids were passed through. Finally on Friday, the miners were winched up one-by-one in a specially made capsule.

They include what appear to be images from: The site's database shows listings for 4,591 cameras in the US, 2,059 in France and 1,576 in the Netherlands. Smaller numbers of feeds are also identified as being available from developing economies including Nicaragua, Pakistan, Kenya, Paraguay and Zimbabwe. Some of the feeds showed a static image but did not otherwise appear to be working. The privacy watchdogs have provided the name of the site to the media, however the BBC has opted not to publish it. The administrator of the site told the BBC via email that he was not Russian. He added that he did not consider himself a hacker as the cameras featured on the site had extremely weak password protection. As well as setting hard-to-guess passwords instead of the default one that came with the device, camera owners are also being advised to check their equipment and turn off remote access if they do not need it. One wireless camera maker, Foscam, reiterated this advice pointing out that it has altered the software it uses to force customers to choose a new password in place of the default one.

His connection with the United States dated back to the 1950s, when according to various accounts, he was recruited as a CIA informant while studying at a military academy in Peru. Noriega, now 77, eventually became a prized American \"asset\" in a region that was becoming politically hostile to US interests in the wake of the Cuban Revolution. He rose within the ranks of the Panamanian armed forces to become a key supporter of Gen Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the US to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty in 1977. After Gen Torrijos's death in a mysterious plane crash in 1981, Noriega became the power behind the scenes as head of the security services. The US relied on Panama as a regional listening post and Noriega obliged with unfaltering support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in the fight against the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador. At the same time, he began to play an increasingly repressive role internally in Panama, especially after the assassination of Hugo Spadafora, a political opponent who was found beheaded in 1985. Noriega allegedly played a role in the mid-1980s Iran-Contra affair, which involved the smuggling of weapons and drugs to aid US undercover efforts to support the anti-government forces opposing the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. However, the US became increasingly suspicious of Noriega amid indications that he was selling his services to other intelligence bodies, not to mention drug-trafficking organisations. Pop and rock These tensions became public in 1988 when Noriega was indicted in a US federal court on drug-trafficking charges. He was also accused of rigging elections in 1989.

Under joint enterprise, groups or gangs can be charged with murder even if just one person delivered the fatal blow. Ahead of any legislation, the director of public prosecutions has agreed to issue guidelines on the level of involvement needed for a murder charge. The MPs' committee said the law surrounding gang murder cases was now so complicated that juries \"may find it impossible to understand how to reach the right verdict\". Its report said a new law was needed to ensure justice and end the high number of appeals against convictions. In the meantime prosecutors should urgently be given new guidance in joint enterprise cases, particularly those involving gang-related killings, the MPs said, to help clarify the situation before a new law can be brought in. 'Own actions only' The legal principle of joint enterprise - through which two men were convicted earlier this month of the 1993 murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence - means that entire groups or gangs can be charged with murder, even if only one person carried out the killing. In December, five teenagers were given sentences of detention for killing 15-year-old Zac Olumegbon, who was stabbed to death as he arrived at school in West Norwood, south London, in July 2010. Speaking after the case, Det Ch Insp John McFarlane said: \"This case must act as a deterrent to other young people who think they will not be prosecuted or go to prison just because they did not deliver the fatal blow. \"The law on joint enterprise is clear and unforgiving - if you are with the knifeman in a murder case you too could be found guilty and sent to prison.\" Jordan Towers was jailed for life in 2007 after being convicted of murder under joint enterprise.

The woman was previously issued with a \u00a3200 fixed penalty notice by Hampshire Constabulary following posts referring to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. It said the posts on Facebook had caused \"angst in the community\". A spokesman from Hampshire police said: \"The CPN is designed to prevent unreasonable behaviour that is having a negative impact on the local community's quality of life.\" He said it related to a \"suspicious incident where an individual attempted to video staff and patients\" at the same hospital on Sunday. Other videos relate to St Richard's Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex. Ch Insp Jon Carter of Sussex Police said: \"There are a variety of tactics of dealing with this kind of unacceptable behaviour. \"We are working together with Hampshire Constabulary to ensure the best avenues to deter this behaviour from continuing are taken.\" University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust said false information was causing \"upset and distress\" to staff, after a similar post was uploaded about Southampton General Hospital. NHS managers have pointed out that because of the way healthcare trusts have reorganised hospitals to separate Covid patients from others and cancelling non-urgent care to free up capacity, some parts of hospital buildings would look empty.

Susan Gill, who runs the town's Homeless Cafe, has called on the authority to reverse its decision. The council said it \"continues to provide services to help the most vulnerable in society\". Independent councillor Jon Rathmell has called a meeting to discuss the situation, saying: \"Since the service was withdrawn on 1 April 2019, five homeless people have died on Middlesbrough streets. This is five deaths too many.\" Ms Gill said those who had died used to come to her cafe. \"They were all under the Breaking the Boundaries Team,\" she said. \"After the council moved the staff to other jobs, it had a really bad effect on a lot of people who are struggling to cope.\" 'Joined-up thinking' An extraordinary council meeting on Wednesday will discuss the team's withdrawal, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Mr Rathmell, leader of Middlesbrough Independent Councillors' Association, said he was asking for \"a bit of joined-up thinking\". Enforcement by street wardens without rehabilitation from the Breaking the Boundaries Team was \"not going to tackle the issue,\" he warned. The council said it did not dispute the figure and expected the number of drug-related deaths, including people who were not homeless, would be higher. A spokesman said the full picture would be presented to the council at the meeting. \"The Breaking the Boundaries team no longer exists in its previous form, however the officers have been redeployed in similar roles,\" he said. \"The council values the work of the Homeless Cafe and we are continuing to speak Susan Gill about our future relationship.\"\n\nSummary:","340":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

This is because data shows millions of you engage directly with BBC News every day. So the plan is to place stories aimed at younger audiences where those people are already looking. It all follows last week's government plans for the future of the BBC. As it was published Culture Secretary John Whittingdale named Radio 1 Newsbeat as a BBC service which manages to be both \"distinctive and popular\". So why the move? Newsbeat's online audience has grown by more than 40% in a year. Up to a million of you are clicking on Newsbeat articles every day. But BBC audience research shows that 16 to 25-year-olds are finding Newsbeat stories via the main BBC News website, the BBC News app and through shares on social media. Today's report says audiences \"are telling us that, online, BBC News is the brand\". The BBC says the changes will mean readers find Newsbeat's journalism while they are browsing the BBC News main homepage and app. Where you won't find Newsbeat Newsbeat won't have a separate site any more - but will feature in a strand of stories on the main BBC News website. And the Newsbeat app will be phased out as the Newsbeat team focuses on putting its journalism inside the main BBC News app. Where you will find Newsbeat Once the changes happen you'll see Newsbeat in the middle of the BBC News homepage.

Police say that he was the suspect in an assault case and was interfering with medics who were working on the victim when he was he was shot. Protesters have camped outside the police station for two days, and blocked a major highway on Monday. That demonstration led to the arrest of 51 protesters on Monday night. Police have released few details about the shooting of Clark - who some say was handcuffed when he was shot. Police have denied that claim. Monday night's demonstrations came after the mayor's decision to ask the federal government to launch a civil rights investigation. Mayor Betsy Hodges said she was asking for the investigation in the \"interest of transparency and community confidence\". While a state agency has already launched a criminal investigation, the mayor said that the city needs \"all the tools we have available to us\". Two officers involved in the shooting are on paid leave - which is standard procedure after incidents such as this. The police chief has said that the officers were not wearing body cameras, but would not say whether the squad car or other surveillance video captured the incident. Protesters have welcomed the federal investigation, but have vowed to continue demonstrating until any video of the situation is released and the officers involved are identified. The protests began on Sunday and included an overnight encampment at a Minneapolis police station near the scene of the shooting. At least eight tents were seen at the campsite on Monday, and a few protesters were sitting inside the glass doors of the station - including one who was knitting. \"We're still not moving until we get that footage,\" said Michael McDowell, a demonstrator with the Black Lives Matter movement.

In the Autumn Statement, Chancellor Philip Hammond pledged to raise the wage to \u00a37.50 an hour next April. The OECD also forecast that the UK would have one of the lowest growth rates among G20 countries by 2018. The National Living Wage was introduced by Chancellor George Osborne in his Budget in July 2015. It came into effect in April this year, and was set at a rate of \u00a37.20 an hour for workers aged 25 and over, with the aim of increasing it to \u00a39 an hour by 2020. Pay rise The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility estimated it would give a pay rise to 1.3 million workers this year. The OECD said the UK's labour market had been \"resilient\", although job creation had moderated recently. \"Real wages have been growing at a time of low inflation, but the fall of the exchange rate has started to increase price pressures,\" it said. \"Caution is needed with the implementation of the policy to raise the National Living Wage to 60% of median hourly earnings by 2020. \"The effects on employment need to be carefully assessed before any further increases are adopted, especially as growth slows and labour markets weaken.\" The organisation's stance echoes the widespread claims of business organisations in the 1990s that the introduction of the UK's national minimum wage - which started in 1999 - would lead to widespread job losses. Those fears proved to be groundless, with the number of people in employment rising from 27 million then to nearly 32 million now. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent The OECD says the world economy has been stuck in a low growth trap for five years.

The government seems emboldened to press on with strategies aimed at persuading companies to cut calorie content and to wean consumers off their fast-food habit. First of all, policymakers may well consider extending the scope of the sugar tax to flavoured milk drinks. They were left out of the scope of the levy when it was first announced in 2016. But the instigator of the policy, George Osborne, when he was chancellor, now says he wishes he had gone further at the outset and included sugary milk drinks in the tax net. He hinted that current cabinet members should move more rapidly. Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Osborne said: \"I was already, before I left office, looking at whether you could extend it to sugar added to milk products like sugary milkshakes. I think it'll be for others to take further steps forward and I would predict those steps will be taken.\" In train already is a sugar reformulation plan. This is aimed at products not covered by the soft drinks levy, such as cakes, biscuits and cereals. Manufacturers and retailers have reached agreement with health officials to cut sugar content of these food items by 20% over four years with a 5% reduction in the first year. They can do it either by introducing new recipes or cutting portion sizes. Public Health England says the results from the first year of this sugar reduction plan are due to be published in May. A stack of market sales data has been assembled and officials are analysing it to work out whether companies in each category are cutting sugar content in line with the target. It's understood that the sugar content removed by the food and restaurant industries in the first year has fallen short of the required 5%. Better progress has been made apparently by cereal manufacturers than biscuit and chocolate producers. It's a voluntary plan and critics will point out that there are\n\nSummary:","344":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Pressure to make the data available has been increased by the German regional Information Commissioner that started the inquiry. In a statement, Dr Johannes Caspar said he expected Google to \"continue on the path of co-operation and transparency\". Google had until the early hours of 27 May to hand over the data to Dr Caspar from the Hamburg Information Commissioner's office. Dr Caspar had requested answers to a range of technical questions about how Google had managed to gather details of internet traffic from wi-fi networks belonging to individuals and businesses all over the world. He had also asked to see the data that Google gathered. Google answered many of the Information Commissioner's questions in time for the 27 May deadline and made a Street View car available for tests. However, it refused to hand over the hard disk of data, amid concerns that it may be breaching German telecommunication law by doing so. But Dr Caspar told the BBC last week: \"I have asked the General Prosecutor in Hamburg whether Google would face problems in giving us the material, and he told us that this would not be a problem.\" Google said previously it had been trying to improve location-based services by collecting wi-fi data, but claimed that a \"failure of communication between and within teams\" led to the capture of data transmitted across unencrypted wireless networks.

Jimmy Savile, a Radio 1 DJ and BBC presenter, died aged 84 in October 2011 - a year before allegations he had sexually abused children were broadcast in an ITV documentary. The claims prompted more than 100 people to come forward to police, giving accounts of how they were sexually abused by Savile on NHS premises and in other places. The Department of Health asked hospital trusts to investigate and appointed Kate Lampard QC to oversee the independent hospital investigations. The findings of inquiries at 28 hospitals - including Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor psychiatric hospital - were published in June 2014. What are the latest NHS reports? They are delayed reports into Savile's activities at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire, Springfield Hospital in London, and Crawley Hospital in West Sussex. Since June, a further wave of allegations emerged at some of the original 28 hospitals, and a further eight hospitals and one ambulance service. Fresh investigations have been carried out and reports have been published. What did the initial NHS inquiries conclude? The reports on 28 hospitals found the late DJ subjected patients, visitors and staff across the country to \"truly awful\" sexual abuse for more than four decades. Savile's victims at Leeds General Infirmary ranged from five-year-olds to 75-year-olds, and included men, women, boys and girls. The allegations included rapes. At high-security hospital Broadmoor, Savile sexually abused at least five individuals, including two patients who were subjected to repeated assaults. The reports found failings at the hospitals in the way complaints were passed on and how access to wards was controlled. How else did police respond to the ITV report claims? In 2012, the Metropolitan Police launched a criminal investigation called Operation Yewtree - following the broadcast of the ITV documentary.

Research houses put out daily reports trying to make sense of the fear and anxiety amongst investors as billions of dollars evaporated in front of their eyes. But where do Asian economies stand in all of this? And was all the fear and anxiety overblown and misplaced? After all, as one economist told me, \"sometimes markets move so much faster than economists can update their data\". Let's break it down and look at the facts There's no denying that Asian investors were rightly concerned by the stock market falls and recent yuan devaluation in China - there was a knock-on effect on commodity prices and some Asian currencies touched multi-year lows. Adding to concerns was what appeared to be incompetence on the part of the Chinese government after they failed to halt the market slide despite pumping in an estimated $200bn. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) came out and acknowledged that global growth would be affected by what happens in China - because it makes up such a large part of the global economy. And then there are low commodity and oil prices - a boon for Asian countries like India which import raw materials and oil, but not so great for countries like Malaysia which is a net exporter of oil. So what that does all of that mean for Asian growth? Well, many economists feel that Asia will ride it out. To find out why, we need to cast our eyes back to 2008 and the last financial crisis. According to Standard & Poor's (S&P), Asia's economic growth before the crisis was 5.5% - a fifth of which was driven by external demand from the US and Europe. During the global financial crisis of 2008, S&P says global trade collapsed and has never fully re\n\nSummary:","348":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The couple were offered counselling soon after their loss with Karen Burgess, the chief executive of Petals. Mrs Johnson described it as \"so incredibly crucial\" and said it allowed her and her husband to \"properly grieve\". \"The question is whether we'd still be potentially even together...or alive [without it],\" she added. \"Without Karen I don't know if I would have come out the other side.\" Mr Johnson said: \"What Petals provided for us was the silence that we could fill with what we were going through - it was a compassionate, understanding silence.\" Now aged two, their daughter Imogen still needs a feeding tube but Mrs Johnson said she was \"full of life and vigour\".

The Welsh Government will work with councils, housing associations, agencies and charities to help young people find stable accommodation. Last year, ministers dropped plans to end child poverty by 2020, saying they did not have the necessary powers. 'Personal passion' The extra funding for homelessness announced on Sunday is for the 2019-20 financial year and is in addition to the extra \u00a320m announced in the Welsh Government's draft budget in October.

Mr Harrison was also contacted by police, not initially as a suspect, but to give a witness statement. He had been in Mr Jackson's house on the night in question and had shared a taxi home with the woman. After giving his witness statement, later in the day he exchanged messages with Blane McIlroy.

The Scottish government said it was not a new vaccine and had been used extensively with millions of doses given to babies in other countries. Hospital admissions In the US, it is claimed rotavirus-related hospital admissions have fallen by as much as 86% due to the vaccine. Scotland's Public Health Minister Michael Matheson said: \"Currently in Scotland, around 1,200 babies have to go to hospital every year due to severe diarrhoea and vomiting caused by rotavirus, and in some of the most serious cases that can result in a hospital stay. \"The vaccine will not only protect tens of thousands of children from the effects of rotavirus every year, it will cut down on costly hospital admissions and the anxiety of hospital stays for parents and children.\" The vaccine is the first of a number of forthcoming additions to Scotland's immunisation programmes. A shingles vaccine for people aged 70 and up to 79 years is to be introduced from September 2013. Changes are also being made to the schedule for administering the Meningitis C vaccine and the seasonal flu programme is being extend to include all children aged two to 17 years.\n\nSummary:","357":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But giving up banking secrecy is likely to be a painful process for the Swiss. While other countries see the practice as a way to hide the ill-gotten profits of crime, corruption, or tax evasion, in Switzerland it is viewed as an honourable policy which illustrates the relation of trust between state and citizen. \"The origin of Swiss banking secrecy... is really a professional secrecy like that of a doctor or a lawyer,\" explains Michel DeRobert, head of the Association of Swiss Private Bankers. \"He is not supposed to give out the data of his clients, he's not supposed to repeat it to other people.\" Honourable history? Those who want to keep the current secrecy often claim that it was first introduced in the 1930s in order to protect German Jews, who were investing their assets in Swiss banks in order to stop the Nazis seizing them. Although this certainly happened, in fact the Swiss Banking Act of 1934 was introduced in the wake of a scandal in which a number of French politicians and businessmen were publicly identified as having hidden their money in Switzerland. The act was designed to protect client privacy in the future. If the recent events surrounding France's disgraced former budget minister Jerome Cahuzac are anything to go by, some European politicians have continued to benefit from the secrecy. Mr Cahuzac, charged with sorting out tax evasion in France, was recently revealed to have put hundreds of thousands of euros in a secret Swiss bank account, in the hope of escaping the attentions of the taxman. Examples like these are causing fury in cash-strapped European capitals. Greece, too, has seen much needed tax revenue disappear into Swiss banks, and a desire to reclaim as much unpaid tax as possible, as soon as possible, is a big rea\n\nSummary:","358":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It also reveals that the chair of a proposed independent review of education provision could be paid \u00a31,500 per day. The document from the Department of Education (DE) will be considered by MLAs on Wednesday. They are due to question senior officials on the 2020-21 education budget, which, at over \u00a32bn a year, is one of Stormont's biggest. The department bid for an extra \u00a3427m in funding in the 2020-21 budget to meet the costs of increasing pressures, but received \u00a3227m. The New Decade New Approach (NDNA) deal also included commitments like addressing financial pressures in schools and an independent review of education provision in Northern Ireland. Previous research has suggested that Northern Ireland faced the highest school spending cuts per pupil over the past decade. An increasing number of schools have also gone into budget deficit in recent years. The DE paper prepared for MLAs said that \"the assessed shortfall in the aggregated schools budget (ASB) is estimated to be up to \u00a3180m over the next three years\". \"It is estimated that \u00a3180m would be required for schools over the next three years to reverse real terms reductions experienced since 2010-11.\" 'Not sustainable' An independent root and branch review of education in Northern Ireland was one of the key measures promised in the NDNA deal. The deal said the way education is run at present - with a range of sectors and school types - is \"not sustainable\" and it promised a \"fundamental review\" as a basis for change. The department estimates that review will cost \u00a31.1m a year. \"It could be expected that a three-person panel would be required (chair and panel members) with support from a secretariat function,\" the DE budget briefing said.

Transport for London (TfL) said the Tube was safe and released CCTV footage which it said showed the station was not overcrowded when the woman fell. It is thought the woman, who was treated for a broken arm and a black eye, caught her coat in the train door. London Underground said at the time of the incident the platform was not overcrowded and a full investigation was under way into what happened. The BBC understands the woman, in her 20s, boarded the train at about 08:00 GMT but decided to disembark because it was so full. As she tried to get off the train it is thought her jacket snagged in the doors and she was pulled under the train as the driver began to pull out of the station, TfL said. When the driver realised what was happening he stopped as soon as he could. The RMT said it had formally warned London Underground (LU) last week about the \"death trap\" overcrowding situation at Clapham South, during a specially convened safety meeting. In a statement issued on Thursday, RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: \"The terrifying incident at Clapham South added to major issues at Brixton and Oxford Circus last week and the chaos at London Bridge.\" He said the impression was that transport bosses were \"taking serious risks\" with people's lives, which he put down to insufficient capacity and a reduction in the number of station staff available to help passengers. \"This critical situation cannot be allowed to continue until we have a fatality on our hands. \"Our members know where the death traps are and where the pressures are building up, and we are demanding a top level safety summit to allow us to get our safety fears addressed and dealt with, and that also means an immediate halt to the job cuts,\" he added.

The measure has divided opinion in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. Pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners criticised the compromise that sealed the deal set to be signed into law by President Jose Mujica. The proposal had already been approved by the lower house of Congress and the Senate, but politicians from both sides of the debate agreed further changes and held another vote. Abortions versus adoptions Pro-choice campaigners say many lives will be saved with the end of clandestine, high-risk terminations. \"With this law, we are joining the ranks of developed countries that have largely adopted a stance to liberalise, recognising the failure of criminal laws to avoid abortions,\" said government Senator Luis Gallo. Pro-choice campaigners reject changes to the proposal that forces women to justify before a panel of experts why they wish a termination. After that, they will need to wait for several days - a period of reflection - before being able to state their final decision. Anti-abortion politicians said the government should have adopted measures to encourage adoptions, rather than change the law. \"Abortion is not a medical act. It does not seek to protect and preserve a patient's health,\" said opposition Senator Alfredo Solari. Abortion is legal and available on request in Cuba. Abortion is also allowed up to the 12th week of pregnancy in many Mexican states and in the area of the capital, Mexico City. In other Latin American countries, it is only allowed in cases of rape or health risk for the woman.\n\nSummary:","361":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He had his eyes gouged by a female passenger, before being punched in the face. Three of the car occupants were later jailed for the attack. AMs gave their support on Tuesday to a new law for 999 staff. Labour MP Chris Bryant wants to double the maximum sentence for common assault on an emergency worker to a year. The Rhondda MP said there were 20 such assaults in Wales a day. AMs unanimously agreed on Tuesday that the Parliamentary legislation, which has been given support by the UK and Welsh governments, can apply to assaults on workers in the Welsh NHS and fire services. Det Sgt Dowler said any additional protection for 999 staff had to be welcomed, as he described the attack on him. He had stopped late at night after spotting a parked car with smoke coming from the wheels. But as he approached the vehicle, the driver ran off, and the officer chase him - ending up on the floor with the man. \"Whilst I was holding onto the driver on the floor one of the female occupants of the car jumped on my back and started gouging my eye,\" he told the Good Morning Wales programme on BBC Radio Wales. \"I realised at that point I was in serious trouble with a large number of people around me and I was by myself.\" He managed to activate his emergency radio alarm but then the assailants threw his radio away. \"I felt completely vulnerable, and completely alone at that point.\" A further scuffle developed with another passenger, before he was hit. \"We were sort of grappling for a short amount of time and at that point he punched me to the face and I fell to the floor in some sort of state of unconsciousness.\" He said a judge described his facial injuries as some of the worst he had seen, when the three attackers were caught and went to court.

Since 2011 they have been used at least 2,486 times - in 635 cases on people with suspected mental health issues. Campaign group Liberty said the hoods were cruel and degrading, but the Police Federation said they \"should be available as standard\". Four further forces are considering introducing the hoods. The hoods were used on 91 people aged under 18 in the last five years, with North Wales Police reporting the use of a spit hood on a 12-year-old girl. What are spit hoods? Mesh fabric hoods placed over the heads of suspects to prevent spitting or biting. They can only be used once and are usually used in custody suites or when moving people in custody from one location to another. Critics say spit hoods are distressing and humiliating, can cause panic in the detained person, and make it harder to notice if a prisoner is having difficulty breathing. The forces who responded to the BBC said they only used the hoods when \"proportionate, appropriate and justifiable\" to protect their officers. Sara Ogilvie, policy officer at Liberty, said the \"disturbing figures\" showed \"cruel, degrading and primitive spit hoods are being widely used\". \"There is no place in a civilised society for police forcibly covering children's faces. \"And their use on those suffering from mental-health problems will have added fear and confusion to an already distressing situation.\" The Metropolitan Police Service is consulting on whether to introduce the hoods. A pilot planned for October was cancelled after London Mayor Sadiq Khan voiced concerns. Lancashire Constabulary, Humberside Police and Durham Constabulary are all also considering introducing them.

Stops in Kingussie will be cut from 45 minutes to 20 and in Boat of Garten from 30 minutes to 15. The bank said it would review the mobile bank timetables regularly. The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has criticised the changes. In January, the bank told Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee that it would invest in its mobile banking fleet. Colin Borland, FSB's head of devolved nations, said RBS made an argument that the impact of Scottish branch closures would be mitigated by \"smart\" ATMs and mobile van bank services. But he said that it now appeared to be that because more branches were closing mobile van services would be \"spread even more thinly - making it harder for local businesses and consumers to access banking services\". Mr Borland said: \"RBS looks again like it is trying to cut services that customers find valuable. \"This move also seems to clash with evidence RBS chiefs gave to MPs in January, where they talked up investment in their mobile bank fleet. \"It wouldn't surprise me if MPs on the Scottish Affairs Committee will be keen to get to the bottom of this when they take evidence from RBS chief, Ross McEwan, next month.\" A Royal Bank of Scotland spokesperson said: \"Our customers have many different ways to bank with us.

The 1911 edition included biplane - a aeroplane with two sets of wings, and marconigram - a message sent via radio. Other pre-existing words have had their meanings shaped by popular tech culture.

Manufacturers also recorded a drop in order book volumes for the 15th consecutive month. The overall rise was linked to stronger demand in the latest RBS Purchasing Managers Index (PMI). RBS said the November data highlighted \"some positive signs\" for the Scottish private sector, including a \"moderate\" increase in staffing levels after four months of decline. Its index - which measures manufacturing and service sector output - posted 50.9 last month, up from 49.6 in October. Any figure above 50 suggests expansion. The survey indicated that \"overall demand conditions\" rebounded in November, with incoming new business rising following three successive monthly falls. The rise in Scotland was the second-fastest of the 12 monitored UK areas, behind only London. That said, the increase was relatively \"subdued\", with some respondents noting that \"continued uncertainty\" had weighed on growth. On a positive note, the November data indicated improved business confidence towards activity over the next 12 months. 'Continued uncertainty' RBS Scotland Board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said: \"Nevertheless, uncertainty continued to subdue demand, with client hesitancy reportedly weighing heavily on both output and activity. \"A clearer outlook is required to boost demand and for the Scottish private sector to gain further momentum in the closing stages of the year.\" Revised figures recently released by the Scottish government indicated that Scotland's economy shrank slightly less between April and June than first thought. They showed output (GDP) contracted by 0.2% over that period instead of 0.3% as initially predicted.

In 1961, there were 976 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of seven. According to the latest census figures released in 2011, that figure has dropped to a dismal 914. Dr Rakh, who started a small hospital in the western Indian city of Pune in 2007, says that whenever a pregnant woman came for her delivery, all her relatives would come with the hope that the baby would be a boy. \"The biggest challenge for a doctor is to tell relatives that a patient has died. For me, it was equally difficult to tell families that they'd had a daughter,\" he says. Unsung Indians This is the first article in a BBC series Unsung Indians, profiling people who are working to improve the lives of others. \"They would celebrate and distribute sweets if a male child was born, but if a girl was born, the relatives would leave the hospital, the mother would cry, and the families would ask for a discount.

Sir Jon, who has responsibility for financial stability, predicted that house prices would continue to rise for some time. Earlier this week the Nationwide Building Society said prices had grown by 10.9% over the past year, the highest inflation rate for seven years. Options Sir Jon suggested that the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) may have to recommend action within the next couple of months. \"Whether and how to act further if, following the pause of the last couple of months, momentum continues to build, will be the most challenging judgement the FPC will have to take in the coming months,\" he told an audience in London. He said the recent new rules on mortgage lending - known as the Mortgage Market Review- may help to constrain house prices, but \"they have not yet been tested\". Options the Bank could now consider include limiting borrowing ratios, or forcing banks to hold more capital as security against loans.

In total, there were 15,319 entrants in 2017\/18, up by almost 6% from 14,491 in 2016\/17. It is estimated that about 2,500 children sat both the AQE tests and the GL Assessment exam run by the PPTC. Most grammar schools have been using unofficial tests to select pupils since 2008, when the 11-plus was scrapped by the Department of Education. Of the two testing systems, GL Assessment exams are mostly used by Catholic schools while AQE exams are mostly used by controlled schools. Primary seven pupils can opt to sit either exam, both or none. Some of Northern Ireland's 66 grammar schools accept results from both tests. There were 8,169 entrants for the AQE tests this year, up from 7,725 in 2016\/17. There were 7,150 entrants to the GL Assessment exam, up from 6,766 last year. There have been attempts to create a single exam, and the BBC understands that talks between AQE and the PPTC are ongoing. Although sources in both organisations told the BBC good progress had been made this year, there is no sign yet of agreement on a common transfer test. Pupils received their test mark on Saturday, but will not know which post-primary school they will transfer to until May or June.

Network Rail said: \"It should never have happened on our railway.\" In its report, the RAIB said Network Rail's \"long-term failure to improve the safety of people working on the railway\" was an underlying factor in the deaths. A third worker also came \"very close\" to being hit while the group of six carried out maintenance work, it said. \"Over a period of many years, Network Rail had not adequately addressed the protection of track workers from moving trains,\" the report said. \"The major changes required to fully implement significant changes to the standard governing track worker safety were not effectively implemented across Network Rail's maintenance organisation.\" It made 11 recommendations, nine aimed specifically at Network Rail - which cover safe work planning processes, developing safety behaviours among staff, and research into train horns automatically sounding when safety brakes are applied. Network Rail's route director for Wales, Billy Kelly, said thoughts remained with the family of the men, adding the way it worked was \"fundamentally changing\". \"We've already halved the amount of work taking place while lines are open to traffic and are on course to dramatically reduce it further by 2022,\" he said. \"A safety task force, comprising of more than 100 people, has also been set up to further improve safety on the railway.\" 'A catalogue of errors' Mr Delbridge's son-in-law, Adrian Grant, said the family were \"devastated\" but could take comfort that they can be part of \"putting something right\".

So far, officials have registered 40 aftershocks: 10 with magnitudes above 4.0 and three with magnitudes above 5.0, the Alaska Earthquake Center reported. \"The aftershocks are nerve-wracking, but we want to stress that they are what we would expect for an earthquake like this,\" the centre said in a tweet. The quake was picked up by seismometers across the country in Boston, thousands of miles away. A tsunami warning issued for the Cook Inlet and southern Kenai Peninsula regions was later cancelled. Alaska's Governor Bill Walker has issued a declaration of disaster. President Donald Trump tweeted that the \"great people of Alaska\" have been \"hit hard by a 'big one'\".

The 26-year-old added that despite living online many young people were unaware of important news issues. \"It's a useful platform but it does scare me when you see young boys and girls not really aware of the news going on,\" she added. \"It's selfish - I don't wanna say selfish, that's rude - but it's dangerous for sure.\" Gomez, who has 150 million Instagram followers, was last year overtaken by footballer Cristiano Ronaldo as the most followed person on the platform, and she has previously taken lengthy breaks from social media. In her new horror-comedy, directed by Jim Jarmusch and co-starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Tilda Swinton, Gomez plays a \"wifi-obsessed hipster\" in the midst of a climate change-induced zombie apocalypse.

The trust has been in special measures since October and is facing allegations of bullying. She said: \"It is with great sadness that I have decided to relinquish my post to focus on my wellbeing.\" In a message to staff, Ms Hosein said she had not fully recovered from coronavirus and had decided to leave in order to do that. Ms Hosein joined the trust as interim chief executive in 2018, and was appointed to the role permanently in 2019. The trust was put in special measures by NHS England after the Care Quality Commission found a \"negative culture\", poor leadership, \"normalised\" bullying and cases of sexual misconduct or predatory behaviour. Ms Hosein said staff were \"are at the heart of this service\" and it had been a pleasure working with them. \"I am hugely proud and thankful for the work we have done together to improve patient safety and experience,\" she said. EEAST chairwoman Nicola Scrivings said \"significant improvements\" to performance had been made under Mrs Hosein's leadership. \"The trust moved from being the worst-performing ambulance trust in England to one that regularly met and even outperformed national standards,\" she said. \"Staff recruitment and finances also improved, and new approaches to leadership meant the trust was as well-positioned as possible to meet the challenges of Covid-19.\" The trust's medical director and deputy chief executive, Dr Tom Davis, will continue as interim chief executive.

If that recommendation is confirmed, it would impose restrictions close to full lockdown on the two council areas. Much of the rest of the country will be placed in either level two or three. But rural areas including the Highlands, Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles and Moray, which have far fewer cases of the virus, are likely to be moved down to level one. This could eventually allow groups of up to six people from two households to meet in each other's homes again - although it will not happen immediately as an \"extra precaution\" while the country transitions to the new system. People will still be banned from meeting in other homes in levels two, three and four. But the aim is for schools across the country to remain open, even in any areas that have the strictest restrictions imposed. Full details of the new five-tier system - which will also have a \"level zero\" at the bottom that will allow life to return almost to normal - will be outlined by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon at about 12:20 GMT. The new rules will come into force from Monday. The Scottish government has already published the \"indicators\" it will use when deciding which of the five levels of Covid restrictions each local authority area will be put into, which include levels of infection and transmission as well as hospital capacity. It is expected that most of the central belt - which includes Glasgow and Edinburgh and already has tighter restrictions than the rest of the country - will be placed in level three, as could Dundee. The exceptions could be North and South Lanarkshire, which may go into the highest level four category due to concerns about their high number of cases and hospital admissions - although Ms Sturgeon has stressed that this will not necessarily happen.

The Independent Office for Police Investigation (IOPC) found the vehicle was travelling at an \"appropriate speed\" for the call. An inquest jury returned a conclusion of misadventure into the death. A narrative, given alongside the verdict following the five-day hearing at Warwickshire Justice Centre, said Ms Whitehead, 74, who had been crossing Coventry Road, \"entered the road carriageway of her own volition, solely in control of her scooter\". Died in hospital \"Several witnesses gave evidence and confirmed that they heard sirens and saw flashing lights from the police car in question,\" it said. Police officers gave first aid at the scene prior to the arrival of paramedics but Ms Whitehead died in hospital, the IOPC said. Its investigation found the police car was travelling at appropriate speed for the response, around 65 mph on the 50 mph limit carriageway before the officer braked, immediately before the collision, on seeing the scooter enter the road. It said the police car had been responding to a report of an oil leak from a broken-down crane on a road near Nuneaton, causing a dangerous hazard at a bend. IOPC regional director, Derrick Campbell, said: \"I again send my sympathies to the family and friends of Jessie Whitehead and everyone affected by this terribly sad event. \"The officer was suitably trained and qualified and sadly, despite efforts to brake, could not have avoided the tragic collision.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, and sign up for local news updates direct to your phone.\n\nSummary:","377":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The council claims the move will impact less than cutting individual grants. But bosses at one of the eight theatres affected claims the authority has been \"misinformed\". The plan to withdraw funds from the MWEC is part of its proposals to save \u00a39.6m during the next financial year and \u00a320.85m over the next three years. MWEC has been in existence since 1982 and is a consortium of eight theatres in Ceredigion, Powys and Gwynedd. The venues employ a part-time worker to develop capital and revenue projects for the theatres. In December a report to Ceredigion council's cabinet said \"withdrawal from this partnership would generate savings with limited impact on provision or standards\". 'Misinformed' The council's plan would mean the three theatres in the county at Theatr Mwldan, Cardigan, Aberystwyth Arts Centre, and Theatr Felinfach, would each lose about \u00a316,000 in funding in 2014\/15. But Theatr Mwldan chief executive Dilwyn Davies has questioned the council's understanding of the cuts' impact. He has sent an e-mail to the council's director for learning and lifestyle Eifion Evans, asking for a meeting between the Ceredigion venues, the MWEC, the Arts Council of Wales, and the council. Theatr Mwldan's general manager, Ryan Davies said: \"We believe the council doesn't understand the role of the MWEC. \"It played an instrumental role in providing seed funding that resulted in levering the \u00a37m capital investment made in Theatr Mwldan in 2004. \"I am also worried because the council has incorrectly told us that Powys council has also decided to withdraw their support of the circuit and this was one of the major reasons for the withdrawal of funding. \"We need the council to explain the basis for this plan and how they have been misinformed about Powys council's intentions.\" 'Under pressure' Powys Council directly funds the four venues in the county and they in turn are responsible fo\n\nSummary:","378":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Midlands-based demolition group DSM has also made a move to purchase the massive site. Earlier this year US owner KBR scrapped plans to start manufacturing components for the offshore renewables industry at Nigg and put the yard back up for sale. It is believed as many as four bids have been made for Nigg. Global Energy Group offers support services to the energy industry and has bases in Inverness, Invergordon and Muir of Ord in the Highlands and Dyce, near Aberdeen. A spokesman said: \"We can confirm that an initial bid has been submitted to KBR's agents by Cromarty Firth Port Authority and the Global Energy Group under the auspices of a joint venture agreement. \"The object of this bid is to reactivate the Nigg fabrication yard as a multi-user energy-related facility which will expand its commercial opportunities, benefiting the Highlands and Islands and Scotland as a whole.\" He added: \"As you would expect, the details of the bid are commercial and confidential and cannot be disclosed at this time.\" DSM proposes using the yard for the demolition of vessels and platforms, but also as an \"energy park\" where other firms could manufacture renewable power devices. The company already owns land near the site. A spokesman said: \"DSM is pleased to confirm that we have submitted a comprehensive and compelling bid to purchase the land interests of KBR at Nigg yard. \"We are very enthusiastic about delivering the yard as Nigg Energy Park and trust that in acquiring the remainder of the site, we will be able to deliver what is a superb opportunity for an economic development and renewable energy project for the Highlands.\" Previously, Nigg was involved in the construction of oil and gas platforms and at its height employed thousands of workers.\n\nSummary:","379":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The novel tells the story of a poor South Yorkshire boy who adopts a wild kestrel, and was made into the film Kes by director Ken Loach in 1969. Fundraisers behind the statue hope to have it installed next year to mark the 90th anniversary of the author's birth. More on this and other Yorkshire stories The project was the idea of a former pupil of Mr Hines, who also used to teach PE at a local secondary school. Organiser and local author Milly Johnson said people were backing the project for a variety of reasons. \"A lot of people are supporting this because of Barry the man, as well as the literature,\" she said. \"Barry was a trailblazer for many writers. He was a provincial writer when it was not fashionable to be provincial.\" Ms Johnson said a site had not yet been selected but \"we hope it will be as central as possible\". The artwork is being made by Barnsley sculptor Graham Ibbeson, who has produced statues of cricket umpire Dickie Bird and comedians Eric Morecambe and Les Dawson. A clay model, which will be used to cast the bronze sculpture, was unveiled by David Bradley who played the lead role of Billy Casper in the film.

Later, during Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron denied accusations of concentrating defence spending in the south of England. Meanwhile, First Minister Alex Salmond has written to Defence Secretary Liam Fox setting out concerns about the RAF bases in Moray. Mr Salmond said: \"I fully appreciate that tough decisions must be made in times of financial constraints. \"However these sorts of decisions must also be fair, balanced and responsive to wider long-term social and economic impacts, particularly where these cannot be absorbed easily within local communities.\" It is feared the base's Tornado fleet could be transferred to RAF Marham in Norfolk, where engineering work for the aircraft is already based. It has been suggested RAF Kinloss could be retained as a barracks for soldiers returning from Germany. Defence sources have already said the troops would not arrive until about 2015 at the earliest.

But it added public anger at littering had also increased after people spent time getting to know their local area during their daily exercise. The charity said that anger could be used to fuel a permanent change. \"For the first few weeks of lockdown everything was wonderful. There was no rubbish anywhere,\" said Louise Tambini, Keep Wales Tidy's deputy chief executive. \"Unfortunately, as we've been allowed to come out for longer and to stay out, some people have begun leaving litter everywhere. \"We've had a lot more complaints... about litter being left in our parks and beaches.\" Ms Tambini said she hoped anger on social media at piles of rubbish on beaches and beauty spots could result in permanent changes, with more people picking up litter if they saw it. \"Hopefully, if nothing else, it's made people talk about it more, to be angry about it and not accept it.\" 'Fast food and littering go hand in hand' A petition has been started by the Blaenau Gwent branch of Plaid Cymru to print vehicle registration numbers on takeaway packaging to discourage littering - and has received about 3,000 signatures.

Why is this part of Helmand so important to both sides? Regaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in the north of the province and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, told the BBC late on Monday that the district administrative office had been abandoned by government forces. But Taliban fighters are cautious about entering it, he said. The Taliban is more likely to keep administrative offices unoccupied, as they have done in the Musa Qala and Nowzad regions of Helmand - where 90% of the districts are said to be under Taliban control but the centres are with the government forces. The Taliban intentionally avoids centres of the districts, where they can easily be targeted. Keeping control of the centre of Sangin would not be easy for the militants, but they may have an advantage among the local population. Many locals are resentful of government troops following military operations earlier this year which they say wrought unwarranted destruction to homes, farms, and other property. The Taliban will probably seek to exploit that resentment and foster as much sympathy for their cause as possible, as they did in Kunduz where fighters could be seen posing for photos with civilians. If the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, it should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country. It should deploy troops who do not bear the grudges of those who fought in the civil war in 90s, soldiers who are not \n\nSummary:","385":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The first days of the operation changed the course of the war. But it was not long before war crimes prosecutors became interested and alleged that the general was responsible for a campaign of ethnic cleansing. About 150 Serb civilians were killed and more than 200,000 left their houses in long columns of cars and tractors laden with possessions. This was compounded by widespread destruction of Serb communities - actively encouraged by Mr Gotovina, the UN war crimes tribunal has heard. He was indicted on war crimes charges in 2001, but denies any responsibility. Fighter and playboy Born on 12 October 1955, near Zadar, on Croatia's Adriatic coast, Ante Gotovina left Tito's communist Yugoslavia at the age of 16. He spent time on a merchant ship before joining the French Foreign Legion, where he built a reputation as a fearsome soldier with a taste for beautiful women. He fought in Chad and spent much of the 1980s in Latin America, notably Guatemala, where he trained paramilitaries fighting that country's vicious civil war. Service in Paraguay, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil followed, and he eventually won French citizenship. He also honed his taste for the high life. The Canary Islands became a regular haunt, and it was in Tenerife where Spanish police eventually arrested Gen Gotovina in 2005 to face trial in The Hague. Originally he had headed to the Spanish islands to rest his war injuries, but he soon joined a paragliding club in San Agustin, Gran Canaria, becoming a familiar face in a string of upmarket resorts. The 1980s also brought scandal. A French court convicted him of robbery and extortion, and there were reports of a growing involvement in right-wing politics.

They claim the compensation for removing contaminated debris and patrolling the plant has been inadequate given the risks involved. It is the first time Tepco has faced legal action from Fukushima workers over pay and working conditions. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says if they win, it could set a precedent for thousands of other workers to come forward. The lawsuit was filed by two current and two former workers at Fukushima. The Japanese utility company had no immediate comment. \"My health may be harmed some day,\" one of the workers was quoted as telling Japanese broadcaster NHK. \"I believe there are many people who can't speak out about this kind of problem. \"I may get fired or may be given no further work. But I hope people will take this as an opportunity to speak up and get paid.\" Fukushima fallout The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors went into meltdown after a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 knocked out reactor cooling systems at the plant. Subsequent radiation leaks made the surrounding areas around the plant unfit for habitation. Tens of thousands of people had to leave their homes and businesses because of radioactive contamination, with the majority still unable to return home. The facility is operated by Tepco, which has spent billions of dollars on the clean-up and decommissioning of the plant. About 6,000 people have been working at the plant daily over the last two months, and the lawsuit is demanding that they either be paid directly by Tepco or the government. However, many are employed by contractors and subcontractors. Our correspondent says that there have long been complaints that many subcontractors are not paying their workers properly, and allegations that some are connected to Japan's Yakuza crime gangs.

But a musical satire on the collapse of the bank and the Irish economy, with lead parts played by Spitting Image-style puppets, will open in Dublin next week. \"Anglo Irish Bank is the story of our times,\" said writer Paul Howard. \"I think it's most significant episode in our history since independence and if Jonathan Swift was alive today, he'd want to write about Anglo Irish Bank.\" The writer admits it was difficult to parody the folly of Ireland's 'Celtic Tiger' years because the reality was \"so insane\". \"There's a bar in Dublin that during the years of the Celtic Tiger was selling a cocktail called 'Minted' made up of 200-year old brandy, fine champagne and gold flakes on the top,\" he said. \"A 'Minted' cocktail cost 750 euros at a time and I observed quite a lot of bankers drinking them.\" \"Satire and parody are about finding something that is true and distorting it slightly and creating a cartoon image of it, but there was so much of what happened during the Celtic Tiger that it was difficult to improve on in comic terms.\" 'A lot of cheekiness' Anglo the Musical is set on an island off the west coast of Ireland called Inisduill, a metaphor for pre-boom Ireland, and the story revolves around a modest couple and the arrival of an ambitious relative. \"Jimmy arrives on the island and sets up the first branch of Anglo Irish Bank on the island,\" Paul Howard explained. \"He points out to them that they are debt poor, one of those almost Orwellian terms used during the Celtic Tiger to describe people, and Jimmy persuades them to borrow 890m euros to build an apartment and shopping complex on the island.\" \"It is the story of how it unravels from there for them, for the bank and for the country as well.\" 'It only takes a few muppets to screw an entire country' is the tagline of puppet-heavy show.

The party had earlier won Battersea, Croydon Central and Enfield Southgate. The Liberal Democrats also had a resurgence in south west London with Sir Vince Cable and Sir Ed Davey both returning to parliament. The Tories have managed to win 21 seats. Labour's Emma Dent Coad's victory in Kensington was the final result to be returned in the 2017 General Election. She beat Tory incumbent Victoria Borwick, the city's former deputy mayor, who had a 7,000 majority in the 2015 election. Justine Greening was one of the Conservatives to be returned to Parliament, although her majority was vastly reduced from more than 10,000 to about 1,500. Zac Goldsmith won Richmond Park back from Lib Dem Sarah Olney with a majority of only 45. Labour was already dominant in London, having won 45 seats in 2015, compared with 27 for the Conservatives and one for the Lib Dems. Marsha De Cordova defeated former junior minister Jane Ellison in Battersea, while Tory housing minister Gavin Barwell lost his seat to Labour's Sarah Jones. Bambos Charalambous defeated David Burrowes in Enfield Southgate by 4,355 votes. Labour also won comfortable majorities in marginal seats such as Ealing Central and Acton, with Rupa Huq increasing her majority from 274 in 2015 to nearly 14,000. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who took over Mayor of London Sadiq Khan's former seat in Tooting, also increased her majority from 5.3% to 26.6%. During her victory speech, the A&E doctor said the result was \"a clear message to Theresa May\" as Labour gained 48 seats across the capital. The Lib Dems saw Sir Vince Cable defeat Conservative Tania Mathias to regain his Twickenham seat. Sir Ed Davey also took Kingston and Surbiton from the Tories, while fellow Lib Dem Tom Brake managed to hold on to Carshalton and Wallington with a 2.7% majority.

Flipkart hopes using this expertise will make \"last mile\" distribution of packages more efficient. Online retail has boomed in India and is forecast to be worth $16bn (\u00a310bn) by 2018. Dabbawalas are a familiar sight around Mumbai's often cramped streets - using heavily loaded bicycles to deliver about 200,000 \"tiffin\" or packed lunch boxes every day. For decades they have been using a complex coding system - using colours, numbers, letters and symbols - which has been lauded by researchers at Harvard University and recognised with the Six Sigma level of accuracy, meaning they make only one mistake in six million deliveries. 'Trusted brands' \"The dabbawalas of Mumbai are one of the most reliable and trusted brands in the city. Their unique delivery system has been smooth, reliable and has survived the test of time - even under extreme conditions,\" said Neeraj Aggarwal, Flipkart's senior director for last mile delivery. Dabbawalas will be assigned deliveries from a Flipkart hub while collecting meals from customers' homes. And while for now they are using a paper-based tracking system, there are plans to move on to apps and wearable technology. Like other online retailers, Flipkart allows customers the option to pay cash on delivery of purchase, but initially dabbawalas will only be used for pre-paid orders. The deal is part of the e-commerce firm's efforts to explore new ways of making deliveries. It recently began a trial in Bangalore using a crowd-sourced delivery option on low value items - to connect local sellers and buyers with the help of voluntary delivery personnel. Launched in 2007, Flipkart now has 30 million registered users and has attracted billions of dollars of investment as it tries to dominate the sector.

Problems with the basalt cladding were first noticed at the end of 2014, and consultants were appointed to address the problem. The BBC understands the consultants have recommended that the existing cladding be removed and replaced. Protect The MAC hopes the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) will cover the cost of the work, and a business case has been submitted to the department. The building opened in 2012 at cost more than \u00a317m, but netting had to be put on the exterior to prevent risk to pedestrians and users of the arts venue in Belfast's cathedral quarter. The MAC's management hope the forthcoming work will protect against any further damage and provide a solution to the problem. Joe O'Neill, the chairman of the MAC, said that the venue would remain open while the work takes place. \"This work is likely to take some months and the erection of the scaffolding now will protect the building against any further damage which may happen, for example, in the event of extreme weather conditions,\" he said.

New roads, walkways and cycle routes are being created to serve a 150-acre site next to Glasgow Airport which will become a manufacturing district. The river crossing, the first opening road bridge over the River Clyde, has been designed by engineering consultancy Sweco in collaboration with Kettle Collective, the architects behind the Falkirk Wheel. Renfrewshire Council leader Iain Nicolson said: \"This is fantastic news for the entire city region and for Scotland.\" He added: \"The completed project and subsequent regeneration has the potential to deliver a significant economic boost to the Glasgow City region. \"Current businesses will gain access to more customers and suppliers, while new companies and developers will be attracted to locate to the regenerated waterfront. \"Communities on both sides of the Clyde will benefit from greatly improved access to their work, to education and to hospitals through the new connections which will also help reduce congestion and improve journey times.\" The project is one of three being funded in Renfrewshire under the Glasgow City Region city deal.

South Korea's defence ministry called it an armed provocation to test the response of US President Donald Trump. North Korea's latest ballistic missile test has been widely condemned. The US, Japan and South Korea have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the incident. China said it opposed North Korean missile tests and Russia said it was concerned, calling on all parties to prevent any escalation in tensions. 'Great satisfaction' KCNA said the missile, named the Pukguksong-2, was a \"new type strategic weapon system\". It said the missile used a solid-fuel engine, which gives ballistic missiles greater range and means they can be readied for launch faster than liquid-fuel missiles. It was a new version of a missile test-fired from a submarine in August 2016 and was fired in a high arc in consideration of neighbouring countries, the report said. Kim Jong-un \"expressed great satisfaction\" over the test launch, which added \"to the tremendous might of the country\", the state news agency said. North Korea said that the missile could be tipped with a nuclear warhead. Most analysts believe it is unlikely that Pyongyang has mastered the technology to make a miniaturised warhead that could be put on a missile - but they believe it is capable of reaching that goal in the future.

It was almost a month before their bodies were found. A simple metal cross and a cairn at the site will be replaced with a granite block inscribed with the men's names. Military personnel, including staff from RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, and volunteers have been preparing the site ahead of the installation of the new memorial. A Chinook and crew from the Joint Helicopter Support Squadron airlifted equipment to the location at the weekend. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is leading the memorial project. Last year, the commission made efforts to contact the families of six airmen to let them know about the new memorial, which is to be placed where the men were buried, close to the crash site. The crew were flying their twin-engined aircraft on a night-time cross country navigation exercise out of RAF Kinloss in Moray on 13 April. They crashed at 701m (2,300ft) on Ben More Assynt, a Munro near Inchnadamph, in Sutherland. Those who died were: Pilot Officer William Drew, from Barrow in Furness in Cumbria; Sgt Jack Emery, of Trowbridge in Wiltshire; Flt Sgt Thomas Kenny, from Barnsley in South Yorkshire; Sgt Charles Mitchell, of Aberdeen; Flying Officer James Steyn, from Johannesburg; and Sgt Harold Tompsett, of Croydon in Surrey.

Mr Obama urged Congress to pass a sentencing reform bill by year's end. On Thursday, Mr Obama will be the first sitting president to visit a federal prison - part of week long focus by the White House on the criminal justice system. Speaking to a gathering of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Philadelphia, Mr Obama discussed investments in education, alternatives to trials and prison job training programs. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch has been tasked with reviewing the overuse of solitary confinement, Mr Obama said. \"Do we think it makes sense to lock people up in tiny cells for 23 hours a day? It won't make us safer and stronger.\" The country should not be tolerating overcrowding in prisons, gang activity or rape, which Mr Obama called \"unacceptable\". Criminal justice reforms have been a subject of rare agreement between Republicans and Democrats in Congress. He noted that African Americans and Latinos disproportionately make up most of the prison population. On Monday Mr Obama commuted the sentences of 46 prisoners, many of whom were serving time for non-violent drug offences. \"If you're a low-level drug dealer, or you violate your parole, you owe some debt to society \u2026 but you don't owe 20 years,\" Mr Obama said. Mr Obama said for what the US spends on keeping people in prison per year, $80 billion, there could be universal pre-school, doubled salaries for high school teachers or free tuition at US public colleges or universities.

So where do you draw the line with personal messages at work? \"Well it would depend on the policy,\" explains Felicity Carroll from A City Law Firm. \"If the policy had a blanket rule that no social media was to be used, or no personal messages would be sent during work hours and that was breached - that would give your employer grounds to build a case against you.\" Felicity says the arrangement is simple; on agreeing to a contract you agree to your employer's rules, and they in turn agree to pay you.

That is a time when hospitals traditionally start struggling, as winter bites. If the strikes go ahead, services will be disrupted. Make no mistake about that. But the British Medical Association says the aim of doctors taking part will not be to maximise that - as is the goal in many other industrial disputes. On the first day of action that has been earmarked, junior doctors will still staff emergency care. On the other two dates, they will walk out in the knowledge there will be other medics - consultants, staff doctors and locums - that can plug the gaps. Whether that will be enough for hard-pressed emergency services will be argued over ahead, during and after any walkout. What is certain, though, is non-emergency services will suffer. Hip operations, knee replacement and routine clinics will have to be cancelled. In fact, as happened the last time doctors took action in 2012, over pensions, expect hospitals to start rearranging services in advance. Have doctors gone on strike before? Yes. The last time there was industrial action was in the summer of 2012. That involved all doctors and was over pensions. But during that dispute, urgent and emergency care was staffed and disruption was largely kept to a minimum. You then have to go back nearly 40 years before that for the last time junior doctors took action. That was in 1975, over pay and conditions, but again emergency care was provided. The dispute was resolved within a month of action starting. Want to know more about the dispute? It meant on-the-day disruption was minimised - despite all grades of doctors being involved.

The graduate endowment fee was scrapped for Scottish students in 2007. However, fees are still charged to students from the rest of the UK and from outside the European Union. A paper released by Reform Scotland said it was \"fair\" that graduates should pay back part of their tuition once they were earning the average Scottish salary. Director Chris Deerin said: \"Coronavirus has had a devastating impact on many areas of Scottish life, particularly those which were already under pressure before the pandemic hit. \"There is no better example of this than the university sector. Over half of our universities were already in deficit before coronavirus, and increasingly reliant on fee-paying students from the rest of the UK and the rest of the world to stay afloat.\" The Reform Scotland paper also said introducing fees for EU students next year would remove a cap on the number of Scottish students who could attend universities.

But the Advertising Standards Authority said Beckham was retired and \"no longer likely to hold such appeal to children\". Diageo, which developed the drink, said his fans were mostly adults. The advert, which was directed by filmmaker Guy Ritchie, shows Beckham riding a motorcycle before pouring the drink for friends. The Advertising Standards Agency said as a footballer and celebrity Beckham would be likely to hold general appeal for some children. But it said: \"The shift from football to commercial ventures, as well as his move to play in foreign leagues and subsequent retirement from football, meant that he was no longer likely to hold such appeal to children in 2014.\" Diageo said its research showed he was a global icon that appealed to its target audience of men aged 25 - 40. It said 76% of his Facebook page subscribers were over 18. But Alcohol Concern said the campaign was irresponsible as it would appeal to teenagers and imply that drinking was a key to social success or acceptance. 'Global icon' The group pointed out Beckham's former partnership with the Sainsbury's Active Kids campaign and his role as a Unicef goodwill ambassador. In response the ASA said: \"We also noted that Beckham had been prominently involved in promoting Sainsbury's Active Kids and Unicef campaigns, but considered that these were unlikely to contribute particularly to his appeal to children or to indicate that he had a strong appeal to them.\" Emily Robinson, deputy chief executive of Alcohol Concern, disagreed with the decision. She said: \"Given his other roles promoting sport and the importance of a healthy lifestyle, we think the public will be amazed to hear the ASA doesn't think David Beckham is a role model for children. \"This ruling shows why we need tighter restrictions on advertising regulations to ensure children and young people have far greater protection from al\n\nSummary:","409":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He also co-wrote Michael Jackson's PYT with Quincy Jones. Grey's Anatomy actress and friend Debbie Allen announced his death on Twitter, saying she was \"blessed to have been so close\" to him. In a statement, music producer Jones said: \"There are no words to convey how much my heart aches with the news of the passing of my baby brother James Ingram. \"With that soulful, whisky-sounding voice, James Ingram was simply magical.\" Entertainment news site TMZ said Ingram had been suffering from brain cancer. Born in Ohio in 1952, Ingram later moved to Los Angeles and began his career with the band Revelation Funk. He also played keyboards for Ray Charles before his own musical career took off. He performed vocals on Quincy Jones' 1981 album The Dude and won the Best Male R&B Vocal Performance Grammy for the song One Hundred Ways the following year, when he was also nominated for Best New Artist. Ingram won his second Grammy for the song Yah Mo B There which he sang with Michael McDonald - but in the UK, he was best known for Somewhere Out There, a duet with Linda Ronstadt from the children's film An American Tail. The track reached number eight in 1987 - his only UK top 10 hit - and went on to beat U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For to win best song at the 1988 Grammys. However, his solo albums failed to match the success of his duets; and he stopped releasing new albums in the early 1990s, turning his attention to film soundtracks, with great success. Ingram received Oscar nominations in 1994 and 1995 for The Day I Fall In Love, a duet with Dolly Parton from Beethoven's 2nd, and Look What Love Has Done, from the Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy Junior. In recent years, he had largely stepped away from music, with the exception of the 2008 gospel album Stand (in the Light), which was produced by Jones.

The ex-policewoman's naked body was found when workers noticed a hole in a plasterboard wall she had tried to break through. A coroner recorded a conclusion of misadventure at a hearing this week. Mrs Isherwood's son Craig believes his mother got stuck when taking a wrong turn after using the en-suite bathroom at night. He said: \"She hadn't even unpacked as when they found her body a week later her clothes and case were still in the room untouched. \"We are all absolutely devastated to find out what happened. Mum was so sporty, fit, healthy, and loved playing golf. \"If anyone could have got out of that cupboard it would have been Mum. \"The inquest has brought it all back to us. It's been a tough nine months and losing her has left a huge hole in our lives.\" On 23 September 2017, Mrs Isherwood went alone to the holiday complex in which she had a timeshare with ex-husband Clive. The couple, who met while in the police force, split almost 30 years ago but remained on good terms. Mr Isherwood said the couple had recently sold the time share but his ex-wife had been given vouchers for \"a final stay\". \"She would've usually gone with friends but nobody could make it during that week so she went alone,\" he said. \"We think she arrived there early on the Saturday, had gone for a swim and then gone back to the room after she'd checked in.\" Her family believe she woke in the middle of the night to use the en-suite bathroom.

Her father told Chelmsford Crown Court he saw the castle go \"50ft in the air\". Fairground workers William Thurston, 29, and his wife Shelby Thurston, 26, both deny a health and safety offence and manslaughter by gross negligence. Tracy Ayling QC, prosecuting, said Summer was with her father, Lee Grant, and other family members at Thurston's Fun Fair on Easter Saturday, and that Storm Katie was expected to arrive by Easter Monday. \"While Summer was in the bouncy castle, it blew away from its moorings and bounced 300 metres down a hill. Having hit a tree, it came to rest,\" she said. The two defendants, of Whitecross Road, Wilburton, Cambridgeshire, sat side-by-side in the dock as Ms Ayling opened the prosecution's case. \"It's the Crown's case that they breached the duty of care they owed to Summer Grant by failing to ensure that the bouncy castle, called a circus super dome inflatable, was adequately anchored to the ground and failed to monitor weather conditions to ensure it was safe to use,\" Ms Ayling said. Mr Grant told the court he had taken his two daughters to the fair in Harlow Town Park that day. When asked by the prosecution about the weather he said it was a bit windy but \"nothing to think a bouncy castle would blow away\". 'Cart-wheeling' Mr Grant explained that Summer was on the bouncy castle when he heard his mother scream 'No'. When he turned he saw the bouncy castle in the air.

The music is part of a funeral procession with Tanc\u00edtaro residents watching on. But there is something that makes this quaint little town feel different. The pickup trucks ubiquitous in Mexico are shinier and newer here. Tanc\u00edtaro is powered on avocados, its people are rich from Mexico's green gold. This town is known as Mexico's avocado capital. The municipality of about 30,000 people produces enough avocados to satisfy the demand of all of California. Mexico produces about 45% of the world's avocados and Michoac\u00e1n is Mexico's largest avocado-producing state. From here alone, nearly two billion avocados are shipped to the US every year. And because the industry is a lucrative one, it has been the target of organised crime. As you enter Tanc\u00edtaro, there are a series of checkpoints. They are known as filtros, or filters, by people here. Some are more informal than others. One has a few sandbags and some elderly men sitting on a broken car seat outside a hut. We pass another one with several pickup trucks standing outside. I notice a man with a rifle across his back. This is a well-armed town. Michoac\u00e1n is where the \"war on drugs\" started in 2006. The strategy was launched by the then-president, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, and its aim was to crack down on drug cartels by sending in troops. But far from solving the problem of drug-related killings, it caused the cartels to fragment and violence increased further as rival factions fought each other for control of the drugs trade. \"From 2007, armed people started coming,\" says the mayor of Tanc\u00edtaro, Arturo Olivera Guti\u00e9rrez. \"They started to pressure local authorities, to take control of the local police and take over the population through fear.

Nasa started having to pay Russia to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). At the same time, however, Nasa worked with the private sector to support commercial space travel. Ever a business-savvy state, Texas is doing all it can to entice the private spaceflight industry, starting by securing its own space port. \"We are not trying to reinvent anything, but want to grow into the future of spaceflight,\" says Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership that works with Nasa to identify potential partners. \"Houston is the home of human space exploration.\" Texas has set the gold standard for attracting commercial spaceflight companies, according to industry insiders. They argue that if Texas keeps doing the right thing with economic incentives and legislation it could take the lead in a rapidly expanding market. Commercial spaceflight offers rich rewards for companies and the states within which they locate. SpaceX, for example, a pioneer in the private spaceflight industry, has more than 40 contracted launches on its schedule, including some with Nasa to resupply the ISS, which are worth $4bn (\u00a32.6bn). Longer term this commercialisation of the industry could one day bring space travel to the masses.

But it will be a one-off and things \"will be back to usual\" next year, he added. His comments come as a rabbi in Barnet said she was amazed at how communities had adapted to lifestyle changes. Miriam Berger said she hoped stronger community spirit lasts after the pandemic. Passover is one of the most important dates in the Jewish calendar and has been celebrated by Jews since about 1300 BC. At the beginning of Passover families and friends will get together for an evening meal and a special service called a Seder. But Mr Mirvis said this year's celebration would be \"very different and very challenging\" as many generations of families who would usually gather around the table were unable to. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live he added: \"This year we will be in our own homes, separated from other members of families. \"What we do recognise is that this will be a one-off and for next year's Passover it will be back to usual. \"But, I am so impressed and so inspired to the extent that people are helping others, taking them parcels of food and guaranteeing that those who are by themselves should never actually feel alone and to know that they are part of a community and part of a caring society.\" There are more than 54,000 Jews living in the borough of Barnet alone - making up 20% of the total English and Welsh Jewish population.

Based at the airport, it will work by capturing CO2, the gas which contributes to global warming, from the air. In a separate process, co-electrolysis splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is mixed with the captured CO2 to form syngas, which can be transformed into jet fuel. The pilot plant, which aims to produce 1,000 litres of jet fuel a day, will get its energy from solar panels. The partners in the project hope to produce the first fuel in 2021. They argue that their jet fuel will have a much smaller CO2 impact than regular fuel. \"The beauty of direct air capture is that the CO2 is reused again, and again, and again,\" says Louise Charles, from Climeworks, the company which provides the direct air capture technology. Oskar admits that the fuel has a long way to go before it is competitive. \"The main element is the cost,\" Oskar Meijerink, from SkyNRG, concedes. \"Fossil jet fuel is relatively inexpensive. Capturing CO2 from the air is still a nascent technology and expensive.\" Other companies are working on similar direct capture systems, including Carbon Engineering in Canada and US-based Global Thermostat.

The Metropolitan Police is now leading an inquiry into claims of abuse against the Leeds-born presenter and is pursuing 120 separate lines of inquiry.

He gets his work via an agency. In 2011, he made his way to Italy, where he paid traffickers \u00a32,500 for a false passport. But when he flew into London, immigration officers realised his papers were fake. He was fingerprinted and sent back to Italy. He got another false passport and tried again, but he was deported for a second time. Undeterred, Victor tried to enter Britain from France by ferry. This time, he got in. However, before he could start work on construction sites, companies required him to provide them with a valid national insurance number. Instead of buying a set of fake documents, he paid someone to share their legitimate national insurance number with him. \"You find somebody who is British or [an] EU citizen and encourage them to help you, and we use their documents, photocopies, which would have our photographs on.\" He says the other person is \"selling their identity\" to him.

But trans activist Ashleigh Talbot said the group's letter seeks to \"whip up\" hatred against trans people. Twitter said its rules are enforced equally for every user, regardless of the commentary they engage in. Fair Play for Women describes itself as a group of \"ordinary women\" who argue that \"in the rush to reform transgender laws\" women's voices will not be listened to. It says Twitter users have been banned for stating \"basic, incontrovertible biological facts\" such as saying men are not women. Their letter links to comments, that it says has led to people being banned from the site: Transsexual writer Miranda Yardley said she was banned from Twitter for stating that Green Party LGBT spokesperson Aimee Challenor, a trans woman, is a man. Writing on her blog she said: \"According to the rules of Twitter it is now hateful conduct to call someone who is a man, a man. \"The implication of this is that the concept of proscribed speech, things we are now not allowed to say, now extends to the truth. This is fundamentally illiberal.\" Fair Play for Women also said women receive abuse for talking \"about their biology\" - including being threatened with violence and referred to as Terfs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists). The Green Party's Aimee Challenor said: \"Miranda Yardley's comments about me are abusive and damaging. Twitter is right to take action against this form of online harassment which goes against Twitter's rules.\" Fair Play for Women has called on Martha Lane Fox - who is also a member of the House of Lords - to use her position in Twitter to \"stop allowing bullying men to police our language, threaten us and abuse us\".

The 14 year old was stabbed to death in a Carlisle cemetery in June. Mr Thomson and co-defendants Brahnn Finley, 19, and Daniel Johnston, 20, all deny murder. Prosecutor Simon Medland QC said text messages to friends showed Mr Thomson boasting that he would not be caught. 'You hated him' The accused claimed the messages had been \"a joke\" and did not relate to Jordan's death. Mr Medland said: \"You got out one of your knives and you told Jordan Watson to shut up. \"You pulled it across his throat when he was screaming for his life.\" \"No,\" replied Mr Thomson. \"You thought you were too good,\" said Mr Medland. Again, Thomson replied: \"No\". He also denies hating Jordan and referring to him as \"that little runt\". \"You hated him. You despised him,\" said Mr Medland. \"No, I didn't,\" Mr Thomson replied. The prosecution claim he killed the youngster because he was infatuated with Jordan's girlfriend. The girl, who is now 15 and cannot be identified, said in police interviews shown to the jury that Mr Thomson told her he wished Jordan was dead. Last week, the jury was told a search of Mr Thomson's home revealed a blood-stained Gurkha knife and a large collection of weapons.

His disappearance is not believed to be linked to any plot. Mr Brokenshire, responding to a Commons question, said police were \"doing all they can\" to locate Mr Magag, 28. He refused to confirm if Mr Magag was under surveillance when he disappeared. The government was \"reviewing this incident closely,\" he said. \"If there are practical issues that need to be considered we will consider and adopt them,\" he added. TPims - or Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security and who cannot be deported. They were brought in last year to replace control orders introduced under Labour. Those subject to TPims face restrictions, such as where they stay, who they contact, and where they travel, but differ from control orders in that suspects cannot be forced to relocate to more isolated parts of the UK. Mr Brokenshire has previously said Mr Magag's TPim was issued to prevent fundraising and overseas travel. In an urgent Commons question last month, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper asked Home Secretary Theresa May if she had \"personally made it easier\" for terror suspects to abscond by \"ditching\" relocation. \"You must not ignore the evidence on relocations now,\" Ms Cooper said. \"Isn't it time you took some responsibility and sorted this mess out?\" Mrs May denied that charge and said that, under Labour's control orders, seven terror suspects had absconded and only one of them had been found. Mr Magag was reported missing after he failed to return to his overnight residence on 26 December. He was last seen in Camden at 17:20 GMT the same day.

The boxer, who was 50, fought some of the great names of boxing during a three-decade career. They included Oscar de la Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard and Felix Trinidad. Camacho was being treated at the Rio Piedras medical centre in San Juan. The centre's director Ernesto Torres told reporters that the former boxer went into cardiac arrest in the early hours of Saturday morning, was taken off life support and died shortly after. Earlier Camacho's mother Maria Matias said she wanted doctors to remove her son from life support. His eldest son, Hector Jr, had indicated he wanted to keep his father alive, but his mother had the final say. Flamboyant Camacho was shot in the head on Tuesday while sitting in a car outside a bar in his home city of Bayamon, outside the capital San Juan. His friend Adrian Mojica Moreno was killed in the attack. Police said the car contained bags of cocaine at the time of the shooting, but said they did not know of any motives behind the attack. Camacho was known for his flamboyant style and skill in the ring. He was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in New York where he made his professional debut in 1980. He went on to win four world titles across three weight divisions, beginning with the WBC super featherweight title in 1983. His last fight was an attempted comeback against Saul Duran in 2010, which he lost. By then he had become known for his troubled personal life and run-ins with the police. Camacho was sentenced to seven years in prison for burglary in 2007, though the sentence was later suspended. He was found in possession of drugs and was the subject of a restraining order brought by his ex-wife, who complained of domestic abuse. At the time of his death he held a career record of 79 wins, 6 losses and three draws, with 38 knockouts.\n\nSummary:","433":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

For millions of Brazilians fed up with the status quo, the gun-loving former army officer was the only man for the top job despite sexist, racist and a homophobic remarks he made during the campaign. Reality sets in While 100 days in office may not be long enough to judge the president's performance, some of his erstwhile supporters are now expressing doubts about his ability to lead the largest democracy in Latin America. And among his detractors, there is definitely a feeling of \"I told you so\" after his first months were beset by a series of problems. Late last month, the president caused outrage by suggesting the armed forces commemorate the start of military rule 55 years ago. His anti-corruption image has been tainted by allegations that his son Flavio was involved in financial scandals and death squads. And then of course, there was that awkward time during carnival when he posted a video on Twitter of a sex act performed by two men at a street party that he felt was bringing the reputation of the country down. He has now got the lowest approval rating recorded by a first-time president in the initial 100 days in power since the country returned to democracy in the 1980s.

A World Health Organization-led study looked for evidence of the body's immune system fighting the virus. It showed large numbers of people had been infected, although not all would have developed full-blown flu. The H1N1 virus first appeared in Mexico in 2009 and rapidly spread around the world. Anti-bodies An international group of researchers looked at more than 90,000 blood samples before and during the pandemic in countries including India, Australia and the UK. They looked for antibodies which are produced when the body is infected with H1N1. By comparing the figures before and during the pandemic, the researchers can determine how many people were infected as the virus spread around the world. Approximately 24% of people had been infected overall, but half of school-age children showed signs of infection. One of the researchers, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove from Imperial College London, said fewer than two in every 10,000 people infected died during the pandemic. \"However, those that did die are much younger than in seasonal flu so the years of life lost will be much more,\" she told the BBC. \"The figures drive home how incredibly infectious the virus is,\" she said. Many older people, who typically die during outbreaks of flu, were protected as they had been exposed to the virus decades before. Prof John Oxford, a virology expert at Queen Mary, University of London, said the figures \"make sense\". \"It was the busiest virus on the block and it displaced other influenza viruses - it was the only virus in town.\" He said a similar pattern would be expected in other countries which were not analysed in the study.\n\nSummary:","435":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Developmental problems have led to autism and communication difficulties. \"He needs 24-hour-a-day supervision,\" his mother says. \"Tristram can't cross a road by himself.\" Christine, who lives near Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, said she loved the young man her son had become but felt sad about the challenges he faced. \"I did feel angry when I realised they had known about the problems of the medication when I was prescribed it,\" she said. Problems with sodium valproate, commonly known by the brand names Epilim, Episenta and Depakote, were first identified in the 1970s but restrictions were only placed on its use two years ago. Drug regulator the MHRA said up to four in 10 babies were at risk of developmental disorders if sodium valproate was taken during pregnancy and one in 10 was at risk of birth defects. All of the 17,000 women of child-bearing age prescribed sodium valproate each year in the UK should be on a pregnancy-prevention programme to ensure they are aware of the risks but campaigners and charities said this was often not the case. In July this year, Baroness Cumberlege announced the findings of her two-year review into three major long-term medical problems, of which sodium valproate was one. She said it was not known how many children had been affected by the drug but 20,000 was a \"reasonable estimate\". Baroness Cumberlege said babies were still being born today - estimates suggest hundreds a year - who had been exposed to sodium valproate despite the risk being well recognised and undisputed. She said the system did not know how to ensure every woman of childbearing age on the drug was continuously monitored and advised of the risks. In her report, she called for the establishment of a database of all women of child-bearing age who were taking the drug, to enable women to be contacted and reminded of the risk.

Not far off the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, and just to the north east of the famous coastal city is the area in question. It is an almost unimaginably large oil deposit; 1,500 sq km (579 sq miles) and 326m (1,070ft) deep. Although it lies well beneath the sea bed, under a thick layer of rock and salt, the find is said to be relatively risk-free. Estimates vary but it could hold as many as 12bn barrels of oil. The find has been called \"Libra\" and Brazil is about to auction off the rights to develop the site, with some pretty tight strings attached. Magda Chambriard is the Director General of Brazil's National Oil Agency. For her it's a win-win situation. We discussed Libra and its implications for Brazil as a global oil producer, in her Rio de Janeiro headquarters. She dismissed, with a wry smile, suggestions the country didn't have the experience or infrastructure to cope with such a huge undertaking as the development of the Libra field. \"Everything is very well planned. There are new platforms, new pipelines, more infrastructure,\" said the woman who trained as an oil engineer but is now one of the most powerful figures in the industry. \"Everything here in Brazil is happening in the correct way so we are very confident that everything will be OK.\" Just to the north of Rio de Janeiro, the once small fishing village of Macae is the closest land point to the offshore fields.

The PM has received a boost after Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet over Brexit policy last year, signalled she could vote for the deal next week. She said the prospect of a long Brexit delay called for \"different thinking\". MPs voted on Thursday to ask the EU to push the date of Brexit back from 29 March to 30 June if the Commons approves a deal by next Wednesday - allowing time for legislation to go through. However, if a deal is not agreed by then, EU leaders are contemplating a much longer delay. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay voted against the extension, despite saying in the Commons that voting for it would be in the \"national interest\". He told the BBC he would back a short extension to give time for legislation, but not a longer delay. \"If we don't have a deal, then we should leave with no deal,\" he said. \"That's always been my position. We shouldn't be afraid to leave with no deal.\" The result prompted a number of Tory MPs to say they will back the deal in the next vote, due to take place by 20 March. And the DUP, which has opposed the deal up to now, are seeking further \"clarifications\" on the government's legal advice about the backstop - the controversial arrangement to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - and how the UK could exit it. What happened this week? A series of Brexit votes have taken place in the Commons: However, as things stand, the law has not been changed, as Wednesday and Thursday's votes were not legally binding. That means the UK is still set to leave on 29 March - with or without a deal. What are the UK's options?

But experts said that smoking carried much greater cancer risks than alcohol, for most drinkers. And the only way to cut the risks from smoking was to quit completely. Government guidelines on alcohol consumption advise men and women to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week - the equivalent of six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine (or a bottle and a half of wine). The guidance also says there is no \"safe\" level of drinking when it comes to health risk. This study says even moderate drinking can put people at risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in women in the UK. What are the cancer harms of alcohol? Writing in BMC Public Health, the researchers calculated that if 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lives. In women, alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and in men, it was linked to cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. For their calculations, the research team from the University of Southampton and Bangor University, used data on cancer risk from Cancer Research UK and data on the number of cancers in the population that could be linked to tobacco and alcohol. Dr Minouk Schoemaker, scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, who conducts research into the causes of breast cancer, said the study offered an \"interesting insight\" but the picture was not simple. \"The overall picture of cancer risk is enormously complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions,\" she said. \"For example, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol and cigarette smoking entirely, and the study did not take into account the duration of smoking or time since stopping.\" The study only\n\nSummary:","442":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But he warned that only private sponsorship can safeguard its long-term future. The council said it would still provide the venue, staff and marketing \"in the severest of financial climates\". The local authority always helped to underwrite the cost of staging the annual series of classical concerts, now in its 30th year. Mr Hughes, who has been behind the event since 1986, was forced to personally plug the gap himself for most of the concerts last year. He will continue to have use of St David's Hall but council funding has run out completely for the next series of concerts in July. He has managed to secure sponsors for the anniversary season - one of them is the University of Wales Trinity St David - but doubts remain about the long term. 'Predicament' \"I had a very positive meeting with them [the council] and was told straight away - there is no money but I can have the hall but I would have to run the whole proms myself,\" said Mr Hughes. He has now set up a charity aimed at encouraging sponsorship for the event from businesses and a longer-term commitment from the private sector. He said he can rely on ticket revenue but added that if the event is to continue, it will need to attract private backers. A council spokesman said St David's Hall was also hosting the Tiddly Prom with the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra and presenting the Family Prom as part of the Welsh Proms celebrations. \"Working in partnership with a prestigious musical figure such as Owain Arwel Hughes to preserve this vitally important cultural event shows what can be achieved when all public services are under such enormous pressure,\" he added.\n\nSummary:","443":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Her late husband, actor turned politician Mr. Kumaratunga who led an alliance of socialist parties, actively campaigned for a political solution to the national question. In the early eighties, together with his wife, he visited Chennai to meet Tamil militant leaders including LTTE Supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran who was staying in Tamil Nadu at the time. Left-wing alliance leader Vijaya Kumaratunga was assassinated by a gunman in front of his residence on 16 February 1988. Sinhala nationalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), that opposed any devolution of power and was very critical of Mr. Kumaratunga's policies, is accused of killing the popular politician. Mrs. Kumaratunga formed a government with the JVP in 2004 after sacking the United National Party (UNP) government that signed a wide ranging truce with the Tamil Tigers. Her decision to sack Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe\u2019s government was widely regarded by the analysts as a step backward for the peace process.

In January a 10-year-old boy and 73-year-old woman died after contracting the fungal infection Cryptococcus, which is caused by pigeon droppings, at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. Preventative measures A non-public room, thought to contain machinery, was identified as a likely source and an investigation was launched. Prosecutors are also investigating a third separate death at the Govan facility after the patient was affected by the fungal infection Mucor. The pigeons at Vale of Leven are thought to have been found in a waiting room which was out of use at the time. The health board said staff cleaned the area using recommended products and equipment. A spokeswoman for Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board said: \"It is a fact that large buildings in urban areas often attract a lot of birds and we take a number of measures to help reduce this. \"Our facilities staff will continue to use pest control measures to reduce the presence of pigeons and we are also consulting with pest control experts to seek other methods of control. \"Learning from this has been shared widely with staff to remind them to close windows and prevent this from happening again.\" 'Improve patient safety' During First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Jackie Baillie, MSP for Dumbarton, told Ms Sturgeon there were still concerns among her constituents. She said: \"Pigeons were found roosting inside the Vale of Leven Hospital following the Easter weekend. \"Given the Cryptococcus, an infection derived from pigeon droppings, contributed to the deaths of two patients at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, I'm sure the first minister will appreciate the concerns of my local constitue\n\nSummary:","446":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

That could then be continued for another two years with account holders receiving another \u00a3600. But Labour said the scheme was \"like stealing someone's car and offering them a lift to the bus stop\". Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, added the plans were \"almost identical\" to the 'Saving Gateway' drawn up by Labour when it was last in power. In 2010 Chancellor George Osborne dropped the Labour scheme, which also matched 50p in every pound of savings from low-income workers, saying at the time that it was \"not affordable\". 'Help to Save' Mr Smith said subsequent cuts to benefits would mean \"families are going to struggle to have enough money to make it to the end of the week, let alone save for the future\". But Skills Minister Nick Boles said the scheme, known as \"Help to Save\", and a higher national minimum wage would help low-income families. Mr Boles told the BBC's World At One: \"This is a more generous incentive scheme than the old Saving Gateway that the last Labour government had.\" Unlike the Labour scheme, \"Help to Save\" is available for four years rather than two, and is open to workers earning up to \u00a330,000 a year, according to the Resolution Foundation. The government also announced the national minimum wage would increase from October 2016. Spending cuts The measures will be detailed in this week's Budget, in which Mr Osborne has already warned of further spending cuts. He said that the UK had to \"act now rather than pay later\" and that the UK would see cuts \"equivalent to 50p in every \u00a3100\" of public spending by 2020, which was \"not a huge amount in the scheme of things\".

That circuit-breaker was activated twice this week alone. On Thursday, it was triggered within half an hour of trading. That gave China's stock markets their shortest trading day in 25 years. \"After weighing advantages and disadvantages, currently the negative effect is bigger than the positive one. Therefore, in order to maintain market stability, CSRC has decided to suspend the circuit-breaker mechanism,\" a statement from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said. The renewed share suspension in China caused global shares to fall sharply on Thursday, with Wall Street opening more than 1% lower and European markets trading 2% down. Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Meddling in markets can only lead to misery - at least, that's certainly what many in China's financial circles may now be thinking. The circuit-breakers were designed to \"protect investors and calm markets\", according to regulators, but they have had the opposite effect. Analysts have criticised Chinese authorities for not being clear enough in their communication to the market, and for being too heavy-handed in their attempts to control share prices. This move may well rattle the confidence of investors even further. Watch out for more volatility on Friday.

This was back in November 2016, when the UK business was hit by an outbreak of norovirus, otherwise known as the vomiting bug. \"A lot of the team started to get ill, and we didn't understand why,\" say Mark: \"Then suddenly we started hearing from our customers a few days later.\" In the end 200 members of staff and 160 diners were affected by the virus, and Wahaca had to temporarily close nine of its 25 sites. Not wanting employees to be out of pocket, the company continued to pay wages to everyone who was unable to work, even giving them an extra amount to compensate for the tips they were missing out on. \"It wasn't fair not to pay them,\" says Mark. Meanwhile, Thomasina sent personal apology notes to customers, embedded with wildflower seeds: \"I thought even if they throw it away, they might still get wildflowers growing in their garden.\" Mark even visited a couple in Edinburgh who were affected by the virus on their wedding day. \"I had a chat with them for half an hour. I wanted to say 'I'm so sorry'.\" The co-founders never did find out where the norovirus originated from, but believe it might have come from a supplier. \"By the time we knew what it was, it had gone through [people's] systems,\" says Mark: \"It came and went in a day, but the lasting effect was much greater.\" Financially the outbreak had a substantial impact on the business, with Wahaca saying it was responsible for a \u00a34.7m loss that financial year, compared with profits of \u00a3600,000 for the preceding 12 months. Thankfully, the company was able to recover. Within a few weeks all of the affected restaurants were able to reopen and the business returned to profitability.

The 95-year-old had no surviving relatives, and was thought to have been the last British member of the Warsaw Air Bridge, in which supplies were dropped to Polish resistance fighters. Earlier this month, hundreds flocked to his funeral following an appeal for people to attend. During his service, he flew 37 missions with 178 Squadron which only ended when he was badly injured by a piece of shrapnel, losing sight in his right eye. He was awarded 20 medals by six different countries, making him one of the most highly decorated World War Two veterans. \"It's quite unusual to have that much recognition from so many countries,\" said Ailsa Gough from the RAF Association, who rallied up support for people to attend his funeral. \"But Jim just took it all in his stride and said he was just serving his country and was part of a bigger team. \"He'll be remembered not just by the Polish people, but by the UK as a whole because he was one of the last few remaining World War Two veterans who has done so much, but been very modest about what he has achieved.\" 'Be like daddy' Mr Auton, the son of an RAF officer, was destined to join the service having grown up at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. \"I was brought up on RAF stations and I didn't know any other life,\" he told the International Bomber Command Centre (IBCC) in a 2015 interview from his home in Louth. \"We had to walk across the aerodrome to school.

They were arrested in August after MI5 bugged two alleged meetings of the New IRA executive in February and July. A top Security Service priority is to see how the group now re-organises. \"It still exists and is still dangerous,\" said the PSNI and MI5. They spoke of the New IRA's \"constant appetite\" to obtain weapons overseas, but added: \"It has not been very good at it.\" \"The New IRA has always been a top priority for us,\" a senior MI5 source in Northern Ireland said. \"There was no single trigger point for this operation. The meeting in February presented an opportunity to gather evidence.\" 'Appetite for weapons' The New IRA was formed in 2012 and is said to have about 500 supporters and fewer than 100 prepared to plan and carry out attacks, principally against the police. Last year it murdered journalist Lyra McKee during disorder in Londonderry. 20% of MI5's caseload MI5 has up to 700 staff in Northern Ireland based at regional headquarters in Holywood, County Down. It took over the lead role in intelligence gathering on dissident republicans from the police in 2007. The operational framework was set out as part of the St Andrews Agreement a year earlier. Primarily, it mounts surveillance, but also runs agents. The agreement states all intelligence is \"visible\" to the PSNI, who are also to be informed of all its operations. Overall, Northern Ireland accounts for about 20% of MI5's work, according to annual reports. By comparison, almost 70% of MI5's activities are directed towards Islamist terrorism.

The drawing is sprayed on a door near the Hinode monorail station in central Tokyo. In a tweet, the capital's Governor Yuriko Koike called the artwork a possible \"gift to Tokyo\". The door has now been removed and placed in storage to prevent any damage to it, government official Koji Sugiyama told AFP.

He was challenged at Nottingham railway station on 4 April after travelling there from his Birmingham home. Two of the police officers needed hospital treatment. Sentencing Nelson at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Gregory Dickinson told him his actions had put further strain on the NHS and police. \"This country is tackling a most serious epidemic. Every one of us, every member of the community, has a part to play,\" he said. Nelson, from Broadfield Walk, Ladywood, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to two counts of assault, two counts of actual bodily harm, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of a knife, and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. The court heard Nelson was approached by two British Transport Police (BTP) officers at the station and \"took exception to them asking if his journey was essential\", becoming abusive. He punched both officers, knocking the male one down against a wall and the female one to the ground. The male officer chased after Nelson, who dragged him into the road in front of an oncoming bus. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police then arrived and Nelson charged at one and punched him, despite being Tasered. Nelson then attacked police dog Quantum, kicking it several times and repeatedly striking it to the head with the plank of wood. The dog eventually knocked him to the ground and he was arrested. The male BTP officer suffered ligament damage to his jaw and thumb, and bruising and swelling across his body. His female colleague had severe concussion and bruising to her face. In mitigation, Nelson's barrister said he had been in Nottingham visiting an ill friend and became frustrated because he did not understand how he could get home without getting a train.

Then Johnny Marr arrived for a version of This Charming Man - 35 years after The Smiths' only Glastonbury show. The song's familiar jangly riff drew a huge cheer from the crowd - by far the biggest at the Pyramid Stage this year. \"They say never meet your heroes,\" said frontman Brandon Flowers, \"but I say that went over all right.\" The Killers had already played a triumphant, two-hour set before the encore, opening with the powerful one-two punch of Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine and Somebody Told Me, both from their debut album Hot Fuss. Flowers was, as ever, a restless frontman - straddling the monitors and flitting between his keyboard and the microphone stand as he worked the audience into a frenzy. The set was sprinkled with singalongs, from the chiming pop of Spaceman to the muscular Springsteen-isms of When You Were Young. Flowers also dedicated an emotional version of A Dustland Fairytale to his mother, Jean, who died of cancer in 2010, aged 64. \"We wrote this next song a million miles from here,\" he told the audience. \"We're a long way from home tonight. But you know, home isn't always a place. Home is a person. Looking back at my childhood home was my mother. And her light went out too soon.\" He continued: \"There isn't a grave deep enough, there isn't a grave dark enough to keep her light out of my life.\" Just before the encore, comedian Jimmy Carr appeared on stage, pretending to be a roadie, sweeping up confetti and testing the mics for no apparent reason other than it seemed like fun. The set closed with a triumphant version of Mr Brightside (it had been trending on Twitter for an hour beforehand, as fans clamoured to hear the band's signature song), putting to rest the ghosts of The Killers' first Glastonbury headline slot, in 2007.

The inquiry into the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme is holding three days of closing hearings this week. The scheme was set up in 2012 to boost uptake of eco-friendly heat systems. However, huge subsidies led to a potential bill of \u00a3490m for NI taxpayers. The inquiry is sitting for the final time on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week to hear closing arguments before the three-member panel retires to consider its findings. Mr Jackson told a colleague that under data protection laws she should not give the PSNI an audit done on a boiler belonging to DUP adviser Stephen Brimstone. It followed an anonymous allegation naming the first minister's SPAD, and alleging abuse of the scheme. Mr Brimstone had fitted the non-domestic boiler in a shed at his house. It was mostly used to heat his home. But his application suggested heat was also provided to the shed which was sometimes used for lambing and other agricultural purposes. 'Little or no evidence' The Ofgem audit found little or no evidence to substantiate that claim but after further information supplied by Mr Brimstone, it ruled that his installation was compliant with scheme rules. When the PSNI received a similar allegation in October 2016 that Mr Brimstone was abusing the scheme, they contacted Ofgem. By then Ofgem had done their site audit. However, Mr Jackson advised his colleague not to pass on the audit report. When she queried the decision he told her that while they should assist the police \"we should only do so if we are convinced that they have good reasons to be investigating him\".

They say they are tired of being caught in the middle of confrontations between the army and members of Colombia's largest rebel group, the Farc. The army said it had moved its men temporarily to avoid further clashes. Army commander General Alejandro Navas said the soldiers were still on the mountain where they were based, but had moved further down its slope. Local media described how some 1,000 Nasa surrounded the army post, grabbed one of the soldiers and carried him 10m (35 feet) down the mountain. A soldier fired into the air to disperse the Nasa, who in turn threw soil at the armed forces. The Nasa say 250 of them will stay on the top of the mountain to prevent the soldiers from returning. Tension between the security forces and the indigenous groups around Toribio, in Cauca province, have been growing for the past week. After days of attacks by Farc rebels on the police station in Toribio, the Nasa demanded the security forces and the rebels take their fight elsewhere. They dismantled trenches erected by the security forces. They also marched on a rebel camp in the mountains and told the Farc to leave. Key corridor Defence Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said the security forces would stay in the area and continue fighting the Farc. Mr Pinzon said the government would continue dealing with the indigenous population through \"dialogue and respect\", but warned them not to break the law. The steep mountainous area is a Farc stronghold and a key corridor for the trafficking of cocaine. Indigenous groups say they are bearing the brunt of the fighting between the government forces and the rebels. They say the presence of the security forces attracts the rebels, whose mortars often miss their intended targets and kill civilians. They want to assume control of the area and guard it themselves.\n\nSummary:","458":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It also suggests he will direct other movies based on famous DC villains. Actor Joaquin Phoenix and writer Scott Silver are also expected to return for Joker 2. The most profitable comic book movie of all time Earlier his month, Joker became the most profitable comic book movie of all time, when it was revealed it has earned $950 million (\u00a3738m) at the worldwide box office. Joker has made more than 15 times what it cost to make, reports Forbes. Director Todd Phillips made the movie on a budget of $62.5m (\u00a349m), a fraction of the budget of many comic book adaptations. Avengers: Endgame, the highest grossing movie of all time, has earned close to $2.8 billion (\u00a32.2bn) but had a budget of $356 million (\u00a3276m). Endgame has made more at the box office overall, but Joker has made more in relation to what was spent to make it. 'The intellectual comic book movie'? Joker has even been tipped for nominations at 2020's Oscars. \"I think it's presented itself as the intellectual comic book movie - and people have bought that,\" film journalist Helen O'Hara tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"Comic book fans are going to see it because it's a comic book movie, but it's also marketed as a comic book movie for people who are too cool for comic book movies.\" Joker's box office success means it's more profitable than Tom Hardy's Venom movie, which made $854m (\u00a3663m) on a $90m (\u00a370m) budget - and Ryan Reynold's Deadpool which returned $783m (\u00a3608m) on a $58m (\u00a345m) budget. It has also out-performed older movies such as Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Mask - which was previously the most profitable comic book movie.

The Appellate Body has the final say on disputes that cover billions of dollars of international trade and its decisions are supposed to be binding. However, now that it has ceased to function and can't take on new cases Mr Azevedo conceded that \"significant changes in the dispute settlement mechanism\" will be needed and that \"intensive consultations\" will start immediately. These are likely to include \"looking at issues like how fast can the disputes settlement work\", he said in a BBC interview Those changes are being demanded by President Trump's administration in Washington. Their argument is that the WTO has treated the United States unfairly. Some of their criticisms are shared by other countries but others are not. Despite this Mr Azevedo says that Donald Trump's tenure as US president is not a barrier to reaching a solution. \"It's whether we can find fixes that everybody can live with\". He adds that, \"these are extremely complex conversations and negotiations and very political in nature, so we have to understand this is not something that is going to be solved overnight, just like that\". Mr Trump's role is disputed by Professor James Bacchus, a former chairman, or chief judge, of the WTO Appellate Body as well as a former US trade negotiator.

Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council said the sublease for the house of multiple occupation (HMO) had been revoked before the decision. Planning officer Tom Hubbard said he extended his sympathy to occupants. The former hotel has been used as accommodation for homeless people since 1988. In January, Pierfront Properties applied to convert it into 14 flats and to replace a coach house with five houses, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Two previous applications to demolish the hotel building were refused. The majority of objections to the plans were from people living in the building, including Edward Hyde who told BCP it would exacerbate the homeless situation and put the welfare of residents at risk. He said: \"I am pleading with yourselves to refuse the planning of our homes to give us continuing support for people who are the most vulnerable in our society.\" Another occupant, Christopher Whitely, told the council he and others in the building had been issued eviction notices for 27 September, and added: \"All residents are in complete limbo for their futures.\" You may also be interested in: Karen Hunt, who oversaw the homeless accommodation, had urged Pierfront to withdraw the plans, saying the lives of people living there had been transformed.

Rioting in Tottenham began two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest quickly spread to other parts of the capital and other English cities. 'Valuable tool' The study looked at 2.4 million tweets sent during the disturbances and found \"no evidence\" to back calls that Twitter should be closed down for inciting unrest. Prof Rob Procter from the University of Manchester, who led the team, said: \"In August this year social unrest spilled over on to the streets of English cities and the summer riots were the largest public disorder events in recent history. \"Politicians and commentators were quick to claim that social media played an important role in inciting and organising riots, calling for sites such as Twitter to be closed should events of this nature happen again. \"But our study found no evidence of significance in the available data that would justify such a course of action in respect to Twitter. \"In contrast, we do find strong evidence that Twitter was a valuable tool for mobilising support for the post-riot clean-up and for organising specific clean-up activities,\" he added. Researchers analysed the millions of tweets generated during and after the riots by using experts in cloud computing from the University of St Andrews.

It is the last part of the sector to re-open. Now the government has announced pubs in England and Scotland must close at 22:00. The NI Executive is due to meet this week to decide what restrictions to put in place. Some bars have raised concerns about a possible ban on live music. Ciaran Smyth, owner of Belfast city centre pub Voodoo, said the prospect \"horrifies me as a music venue owner\". 'Drive people to house parties' \"I do not see that the executive can put a condition on wet bars opening that devastates another sector and that's the live music industry.\" He said there should be a risk-assessed approach. \"We have a squad of good security men who can quietly deal with any issue - it's a thing we should be allowed to manage,\" he added. Hospitality Ulster said changes would be a major blow to the sector. Colin Neill, its chief executive, said: \"I don't know who will open, whether it will be viable, indeed I expect premises that are all ready now to say this isn't viable. \"This comes in the midst of furlough ending and all the other schemes disappearing. \"If we close at 10pm as is proposed in GB we will just drive people to house parties,\" he added. Hotel concerns The possible curfew has also raised questions for the hotel industry. Cian Landers, manager at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast, said: \"One scenario could be - this would be a worst case scenario - that by 10pm everything closes. \"Customers are just about to finish their meal - do we send them to their bedrooms? No, we can't enforce that. \"We would have people sitting down to dinner at 9pm so I would be hoping for something later - 10pm seems a bit unfair,\" he added. The Hotels Federation in Northern Ireland has called for an all-island approach. In the Republic of Ireland, drink-only pubs will have a 23:30 curfew.

It does not matter. Dhoni was under no compulsion to make it easier for everybody else, especially those whose job it is to tie up careers neatly and move on to the next big thing. It is likely that Dhoni might continue to play in the IPL. It is a tournament he enjoys, playing for a team he loves whose fans return the love many times over. A man who has played 90 Tests, 350 one-dayers and 98 T20s will, naturally, be missed. This in addition to being the country's most successful captain, taking India to the No 1 ranking and leading them to a World Cup win after 28 years (2011), the World T20 (2007) which set up the IPL revolution and the Champions Trophy (2013). In white ball cricket he is one of the all-time greats, his 84 undefeated innings pushing his average above 50 in one-day internationals. Only Ricky Ponting has led his team, Australia, to more wins. Dhoni has led in and won more matches than any other captain in T20 internationals. He led India in the most number of Tests, 60, and was only recently overtaken by Virat Kohli as the most successful. Dhoni's reign had a profound impact on Indian cricket, and not just in terms of statistics. He rose from what was then a backwater of Indian cricket - the eastern city of Ranchi - and continued the work begun by a predecessor, Sourav Ganguly, who turned to the non-traditional cricketing centres and discovered players of international standard. Dhoni's elevation as captain continued a process begun with the aristocrats - the maharajahs and nawabs - who led in the early years, the middle-class players (often bankers) who followed and then the small-town talent who spread the game; this in some ways reflecting the evolution of Indian society itself. He was eight years old when Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut, and within months of his taking over Tendulkar was saying, \"I am delighted with the way Dhoni \n\nSummary:","466":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Going private would allow the company to reorganise its business without the pressure of shareholder scrutiny. Blackberry has been losing money after failing to keep up with its rivals. Last month the company's chief executive said that Blackberry was on the right and track, but needed more time to fix its problems. If Blackberry decided to go private it would have to find partners who could raise the billions of dollars need to buy out existing shareholders. That could prove difficult as the company has been struggling. In its most recent quarter, Blackberry lost $84m (\u00a354m) and expects to lose more money in the three months to the end of August. Blackberry launched two all-new smartphones this year, the touchscreen Z10 device, followed by the Q10, with a mini keyboard favoured by many Blackberry users. But some analysts have been disappointed by the sales of Blackberry's new phones. Blackberry's managers will have noted the experience of computer maker Dell.

A reluctance to admit mistakes, poor record-keeping and misplaced loyalty were among poor practices, but no laws were breached, the EHRC found. The Met said it was working \"to tackle the perceptions of victimisation\". In total 68 employment tribunal claims were brought against the Met last year, of which it lost three. Complicating factors identified by the commission in its study were a police culture of \"looking after your own\", and the force's \"painful history\" over racism. The EHRC launched its investigation in the wake of the Carol Howard case. The Met came under heavy criticism over the way the firearms officer was treated after it was revealed she had been arrested over disagreements with her estranged partner. 'Unacceptable' No charges were ever brought and an employment tribunal heard she was hounded by her boss for being a black woman. In another case, PC Daniel Lichters was taunted for being gay, and a tribunal said the Met had \"either set out to, or were reckless about destroying the claimant's character\". Laura Carstensen, lead EHRC commissioner for the investigation, said: \"It is unacceptable that police officers and staff often expect to be victimised if they complain about discrimination, and particularly so when this is the organisation to which all Londoners look for protection and fair treatment.\" The commission said it was unable to decide whether officers actually suffered after making a complaint, because \"the quality of the [police's] data... made it difficult to reach any conclusions\". Former Supt Leroy Logan, a founder member of the National Black Police Association, said during his 30-year career there was a sense that if you complained \"you'd betrayed the organisation or showed a sign of weakness\".

Then, in December, he appeared to soften his language, saying \"It's not a traditional media company. You know, we build technology and we feel responsible for how it's used.\" In a blog post in December I argued that Zuckerberg's firm was indeed a media company, because it is funded by advertising, creates vast amounts of stories (or content), and is the main source of news for millions - if not billions - around the world. Today, with the launch of Facebook Watch, a video service that will incentivise the creation of a new industry in original programming, the tech giant is moving into broadcasting in a big way. It is becoming a destination for viewers of programmes. That, of course, makes it a media company; but qualifying for that label isn't a matter for pedants alone. This is about more than semantics: it's about Facebook's ambition, social obligations, and the future of media itself. Vast ambition It is actually quite hard to fathom the financial power of Facebook today. Despite warnings last year about a limit to how many ads users will tolerate on their news feed, the company is able to charge brands ever more for the privilege of appearing there. Its market capitalisation now nudges $500bn; advertising revenues are up 47%; and earnings by GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) have hit $4bn - growing by a scarcely comprehensible 70% in a year, from a very strong base. Mix that kind of growth and wealth with the Silicon Valley mindset - \"move fast and break things\" - and you get a sense of why Facebook has decided to move into original programming, giving the makers of videos that appear on its platform a juicy 55% of ad revenues - for now at least. This is all about making the Facebook experience ever more sticky: making users want to spend more and more, and more and more time within the walled garden - or echo ch\n\nSummary:","470":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Prioritise exploring over applying Lots of companies have been using the government's furlough scheme to pay staff wages. It means the number of people out of work hasn't risen as predicted, but this will change once the scheme comes to an end this autumn. If you're going to be looking for a new role in the next six to 12 months, it's likely there will be lots of other people looking for jobs at the same time. Helen Tupper, who co-founded career development company Amazing If says it's a great time to get curious about your career. \"Look at lots of different roles, look at what's interesting, ask people what they actually do in an average day, find out the detail of those roles,\" she says. This is preferable, Helen says, to just applying for something because the job title look good. Be clear You might be creative, organised and sociable, but what does that actually mean in the context of the job you're applying for? \"If you're going to try to stand out, what you really want to do is make sure your strengths have a clear value to your employer,\" Helen tells Newsbeat. Celebrate your successes - however small Applying for jobs can be gruelling, especially if it feels like you keep getting knocked back. The key, Helen says, is to celebrate your successes. \"Make sure you celebrate all of your small wins, everybody who does reply, every interview or Zoom conversation you have. \"All of those small successes are things that can build your confidence and resilience for what is likely to be a challenging time.\" Maybe you realise a job you wanted isn't actually the right fit for you?

The party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the Conservatives of stabbing Scotland in the back with Brexit legislation. But Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said people want the UK's governments to work together. He told MPs the government was adhering to the principles of devolution by pushing ahead with the withdrawal bill, despite Holyrood refusing its backing. Mr Lidington said the package was a compromise and balanced. Lord Sewel Earlier Lord Sewel, one of the authors of the devolution settlement, has backed the UK government's view. Under the Sewel convention, Westminster does not normally legislate on devolved matters without Holyrood's approval. After MPs moved to do this with the EU Withdrawal Bill, Nicola Surgeon said the convention had been \"ripped up\". Lord Sewel said the \"size and scale\" of Brexit as an issue meant Westminster must be able to act \"on initiative\". And he said the situation was \"not a constitutional crisis\", suggesting that some parties were using the row to \"seek political advantage\". Live: devolution debate at Westminster Last week, MSPs voted by a margin of 93 to 30 not to give Holyrood's consent to the EU Withdrawal Bill following a row over how powers currently exercised from Brussels would be used after Brexit. MPs opted to proceed with the bill, although only minutes were available for discussion of devolved powers during the final debate in the Commons - prompting SNP MPs to walk out of the House of Commons in protest during Prime Minister's Questions the following day. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Sewel convention had been \"ripped up\" by the UK government, saying Scotland had been \"treated with utter contempt\".

In her paper, Prof Sweeney suggested that Google searches may expose \"racial bias in society\". Google has said it \"does not conduct any racial profiling\". In a statement to the BBC, the company said: \"We also have an 'anti' and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation, person or group of people.\" When placing ads with Google, companies are able to specify which keywords they would like to target. \"It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads,\" the search giant said. Arrested? The study analysed the type of advertisements that appeared on Google when certain names were searched for. It looked at Google.com's core search engine, as well as the search function of Reuters.com - which also displays Google's advertising. Prof Sweeney's investigation suggests that names linked with black people - as defined by a previous study into racial discrimination in the workplace - were 25% more likely to have results that prompted the searcher to click on a link to search criminal record history. She found that names like Leroy, Kareem and Keisha would yield advertisements that read \"Arrested?\", with a link to a website which could perform criminal record checks. Searches for names such as Brad, Luke and Katie would not - instead more likely to offer websites that can provide general contact details. \"There is discrimination in the delivery of these ads,\" concluded Prof Sweeney, adding that there was a less than 1% chance that the findings could be based on chance. \"Alongside news stories about high school athletes and children can be ads bearing the child's name and suggesting arrest.

Mrs Hewitt said GPs told her: \"You're too young for anything like cancer.\" The mother-of-two, from Hereford, had surgery to remove the tumour in April and is urging people to get symptoms checked. More than 2,500 people under 50 are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every year, according to charity Bowel Cancer UK. After noticing blood in her stools in the summer of 2018, Mrs Hewitt was first prescribed cream for haemorrhoids. \"It was persistent, it would stop for about a week and then after a week it would carry on again,\" she said. Despite having no other symptoms associated with bowel cancer, as time passed the occupational therapist became worried the blood was an indicator of something more serious. \"I think I went back to (my GP) about five or six times... they were just saying, 'no you're too young for anything like cancer',\" said Mrs Hewitt. \"I'd think 'they're going to think I'm a bit mad because I'm worrying about nothing',\" she added. After securing a private referral Mrs Hewitt had a colonoscopy and scans to confirm the diagnosis, something she described as \"a relief\".

He said they had admitted that \"taking a disposable barbecue onto the grassy moors and lighting it without having regard for the clear warnings on the packaging or consideration that the grass may ignite was a reckless act, rather than a mere accidental fire\". A Blackburn Magistrates' Court spokeswoman said the arson offence had been withdrawn and the defendants had signed an acceptance of conditional caution.

That has a subtle impact on the choices people make when signing up and picking a word or phrase to form a supposedly super-secret password. It's just one of the many quirks to be found in the password-picking habits of us humans. There are plenty of others. For example studies suggest red-haired women tend to choose the best passwords and men with bushy beards or unkempt hair, the worst. These studies also reveal that when it comes to passwords, women prefer length and men diversity. Big data These facts have come to light thanks to the vast number of passwords that have been stolen from websites and online services, says security researcher Per Thorsheim. Adobe, LinkedIn and game website RockYou have all been hit in breaches that involved the theft of login names and passwords. Add to this the steady drip of security breaches at other firms and you have a vast corpus of data that can shed light on what passwords people pick. The number one conclusion from looking at that data - people are lousy at picking good passwords. \"You have to remember we are all human and we all make mistakes,\" says Mr Thorsheim. In this sense, he says, a good password would be a phrase or combination of characters that has little or no connection to the person picking it. All too often, Mr Thorsheim adds, people use words or numbers intimately linked to them. They use birthdays, wedding days, the names of siblings or children or pets. They use their house number, street name or pick on a favourite pop star. This bias is most noticeable when it comes to the numbers people pick when told to choose a four digit pin. Analysis of their choices suggests that people drift towards a small subset of the 10,000 available. In some cases, up to 80% of choices come from just 100 different numb\n\nSummary:","478":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Welsh government's target is to treat all patients within nine months. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh NHS was \"under pressure\" but stressed it was not \"in crisis\". He told BBC Wales: \"There are fewer people waiting overall in the Welsh NHS than before. \"The number of people waiting over 26 weeks has come down but I am disappointed to see the rise in people waiting over 36 weeks. \"I've made it clear to local health boards, even in the difficult period over the winter, I expect them to concentrate on those longer waiters and I do expect to see those figures coming down.\" 'Increasingly worsening crisis' Official figures also show 88% of people waited less than 26 weeks to start treatment. The target is 95%. Mr Drakeford said it was up to the local health boards to manage the situation and speeding up waiting times \"has to be the priority\" for the Welsh NHS. But Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar described the situation as an \"increasingly worsening crisis\". \"The minister's only answer is to review his own targets.

He was overpowered by passengers on the Thalys express train from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday. No-one died. Three Americans and one Briton who overpowered the gunman were awarded medals for their bravery. A US-born Frenchman, Mark Magoolian, and another unnamed Frenchman will also be given awards later for trying to tackle the gunman. Profile: Ayoub El-Khazzani France train shooting: What we know \"Ayoub El-Khazzani had watched YouTube audio files whilst already on the Thalys train in which an individual called on the faithful to fight and take up arms in the name of the Prophet [Muhammad],\" Mr Molins told a news conference. He said a formal terrorism investigation had been opened, adding that other European authorities had passed on information about the suspect's travels and links to radical Islam. Mr Molins said Mr Khazzani was \"known for his radicalism\" and had recently travelled to Turkey - \"a possible route to Syria\". The suspect is said to have denied plotting a terrorist attack, saying he found a bag of weapons the night before and planned to use them to rob passengers. But the prosecutor said Mr Khazzani's explanation became less and less clear during questioning and eventually he stopped talking to investigators altogether.

Judges will have to decide whether Send funding decisions have been lawful and may order a government rethink. The government said it was investing significantly into high needs budgets. Outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London, parents of children with special needs made a series of emotional pleas for the government to listen. There was talk of futures being stolen and lives wasted as young people fell through cracks in the system. 'Exhausting fight' Lorraine Heugh, mother of 15-year-old Nico Heugh Simone from East Sussex, a party in the case who has autism, anxiety and other related conditions, said: \"No longer can we stand by and watch our children be overlooked and denied the support they need. \"This is about children's human rights which are being taken away - and something has to change.\" Mary Riddell, mother of Dakota, nine, who has cerebral palsy and other disorders, spoke of how her family has had to fight for every single piece of extra support. \"Nothing prepares you for the sheer enormity of the battle.... The fight is real, exhausting and mind-blowing,\" she told nodding supporters. Families of children with extra learning needs have long had to fight for support, but campaigners say the situation has become a national crisis. Austerity budgets and changes to the system, in 2014, have meant the huge increase in demand for support has not been matched with an associated rise in funding. In the past financial year, eight out of 10 councils in England spent more than their allocated budgets for high needs, a BBC News investigation found. And school leaders have complained their school budgets are being used to plug gaps in special needs funding.

George's trip was particularly special because he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when he was 22.

He experienced blurred vision, difficulty walking, vomiting, extreme fatigue and a lack of feeling on his left side. George has Relapsing Remitting MS, which meant that the symptoms only lasted a number of weeks at a time, but he did have to stop working for several months. \"But I'd always wanted to go travelling. The more I heard about it, the more I wanted to do it,\" George says. \"I'm quite stubborn. I didn't want to look back and regret anything.\" Months of careful planning and years of saving funds followed. 'Alone' In the meantime he founded a website, shift.ms , for young people with the neurological condition, because he felt alone and isolated in those early days. A grant from the Wellcome Trust to improve communication between MS researchers and young MS sufferers followed. As a result, a busy online forum and a real community of friends has now built up around the website, which has become a valuable support network for young people. Before George set off on his world tour he had another relapse, losing his hearing in one ear for eight weeks. He also had co-ordination issues, kept losing his balance and felt extremely tired.

Mr Mackay said he had \"behaved foolishly\" and took full responsibility for his actions. He also apologised \"unreservedly\" to the boy and his family. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not know about Mr Mackay's \"unacceptable\" behaviour until Wednesday evening, and is \"not aware of any further allegations\" against him. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, she confirmed that he has been suspended by the SNP while further investigations are carried out. Police Scotland said it had not received any complaint of criminality, but was \"assessing available information from media information\". The force also asked for anyone with any information to contact them. Interim Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw called on Mr Mackay to also stand down from the Scottish Parliament, saying his behaviour could \"constitute the grooming of a young individual\". And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mr Mackay's actions had been \"an abuse of power\" and \"nothing short of predatory\". This is a calamity, without caveat, for Derek Mackay, for the SNP, for the first minister and for the collective Scottish government. One must also express sympathy for the youth who apparently received unwarranted and unwanted attention, together with his family. Not only was Derek Mackay a key member of the Scottish cabinet, with responsibility for finance and the economy, he had also been tipped as a possible successor to Nicola Sturgeon.

Australian government figures show that 92 children are in the Nauru centre, located about 4,500km (2,800 miles) northeast of Australia.

To talk about this most sensitive of subjects, I met a polo player and former social editor at Tatler magazine, Clare Milford Haven, for a coffee in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station. Her eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright and good-looking. He took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006. He was in his second year of studying Spanish and business. Described by his mother as \"a doer\", he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job. James had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood. 'Horrendous and alarming' Clare Milford Haven told me: \"I wish I'd kept him under my watchful eye. \"I couldn't force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life. \"It was the most horrendous and alarming experience. \"There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn't see it coming. Our world was turned upside down. \"You have so many questions, and you just look for answers. \"A suicide bereavement is complicated by intense feelings of guilt and shame.\" James Wentworth-Stanley sought help, in vain. He had been in contact with a GP, and a walk-in centre - which sent him to A&E two days before his suicide. His mother has harnessed her pain to help others. Clare Milford Haven helps to run the Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities (TASC). One of her goals is to set up a network of centres near hospitals. Called James' Place, these would offer urgent face-to-face support for patients who are experiencing a crisis but are not in touch with mental health services.

And he welcomed the two investigations being carried out into the incident. John Yuill and Lamara Bell were found inside the crashed car last Wednesday, three days after it had been reported. Mr Yuill, 28, is thought to have died on impact after the Renault Clio left the M9 and went down an embankment on the outskirts of Stirling. Ms Bell, 25, was critically injured and died in hospital at the weekend after suffering broken bones and kidney damage which was caused by dehydration after she spent three days trapped next to the body of her boyfriend. A local man told the BBC he called the police non-emergency 101 number at 11:30 on Sunday 5 July and was told officers would investigate. Sir Stephen has admitted that the initial information received about the crash was not entered into police systems. It was only when a second call was made by someone else three days later that the car, which had gone down an embankment off the M9 near Stirling, was investigated. Opposition politicians have called on Sir Stephen to consider his position, but he has been given the backing of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Justice Secretary Michael Matheson. Ms Sturgeon has said there was nothing to suggest the force's handling of the fatal crash had been due to any \"wider systemic issue\". In an interview with BBC Scotland, Sir Stephen acknowledged that the deaths of Mr Yuill and Ms Bell were \"a tragic situation\" where \"we've got things badly wrong\".

Now the environment watchdog Natural Resources Wales (NRW) says it has received another application. EDF Energy wants to deposit up to 780,000 tonnes of sediment dredged as part of building work for the Hinkley Point C plant. The developers have submitted a plan to NRW for sampling and testing the mud, which will now be subject to a six-week consultation with specialists and the public. NRW's role is to determine whether the material is suitable for disposal at Cardiff Grounds, a licensed dumping ground for dredged sediment around two and a half miles out to sea from the Welsh capital Michael Evans, the regulator's head of evidence, knowledge and advice said \"the first step of a long application process\" was to assess the sampling plan, before the developers request a marine licence to carry out the work. \"The disposal activity in 2018 caused great public concern, so we intend to inform and engage with people about these plans over the next few months,\" he explained. \"We will only grant the licence if the company can demonstrate it complies with legal requirements and we're confident the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.\" As well as a marine licence from NRW to deposit the mud in Welsh waters, EDF Energy will also need another from England's Marine Management Organisation in order to dredge off the Somerset coast. They hope to start carrying out the work in early 2021. Why is the mud dumping so controversial? The seabed alongside Hinkley Point C - which is being built near Bridgwater - is being dredged so that the \u00a321.5-22.5bn power station's water cooling system can be installed.

Several people who've contacted me after comparatively mild illness have spoken of the lingering cognitive impact of the disease - problems with their memory, tiredness, staying focused. But it's at the more severe end that there is most concern. Chatting to Paul Mylrea, it's hard to imagine that he had two massive strokes, both caused by coronavirus infection. The 64-year-old, who is director of communications at Cambridge University, is eloquent and, despite some lingering weakness on his right side, able-bodied. He has made one of the most remarkable recoveries ever seen by doctors at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN) in London. His first stroke happened while he was in intensive care at University College Hospital. Potentially deadly blood clots were also found in his lungs and legs, so he was put on powerful blood-thinning (anticoagulant) drugs. A couple of days later he suffered a second, even bigger stroke and was immediately transferred to the NHNN in Queen Square. Consultant neurologist Dr Arvind Chandratheva was just leaving hospital when the ambulance arrived. \"Paul had a blank expression on his face,\" he says. \"He could only see on one side and he couldn't figure out how to use his phone or remember his passcode. \"I immediately thought that the blood thinners had caused a bleed in the brain, but what we saw was so strange and different.\" Paul had suffered another acute stroke due to a clot, depriving vital areas of the brain of blood supply. Tests showed that he had astonishingly high levels of a marker for the amount of clotting in the blood known as D-dimer. Normally these are less than 300, and in stroke patients can rise to 1,000. Paul Mylrea's levels were over 80,000. \"I've never seen that level of clotting before - something about his body's re\n\nSummary:","494":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A senior officer described his actions as having \"undoubtedly eroded\" the victim's trust in police. On 5 November a Devon and Cornwall Police disciplinary hearing concluded the officer \"used that person's personal contact information in order to pursue a personal relationship\". Police said the officer \"exchanged a considerable number of sexually explicit messages\" while on duty , and did not properly update the victim on the status of the criminal investigation. The officer was first suspended in November 2018. 'Abuse of position' An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation concluded in May 2019 the officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct.

Agents selling the land said it could be developed for wind farms due to its elevation. But the Open Spaces Society said it was dismayed over the suggestion. Common land, which covers 432,434 acres (175,000 hectares) of land across Wales, often dates back to medieval times. The Epynt Commons is owned by Tredegar Estate and is subject to grazing and access rights, but can be sold just like any other land, says the selling agent. Nearly 230 people graze sheep, ponies and horses on the four commons, and this is only the third time in 300 years they have been placed on the market. Chester Master Property Consultants said they had potential for wind farm development, subject to planning permission, due to their elevation and the high wind speeds in the area. The firm said the commons could also interest nature conservationists, local farmers and those with a sporting interests. But Kate Ashbrook of the Open Spaces Society said it would be difficult to build wind farms on the land. \"I am dismayed that these lovely commons should be up for sale with the stated aim of wind farm development,\" she said. \"Whoever buys them, because it's registered common land, would find in difficult to get (building) consent.

The price of a stamp and administration costs would save time and money and ensure physical evidence of tax payment.

Noriega was the key figure in Panama from 1983 to 1989, and was a close ally of the United States in Central America for several decades. His connection with the United States dates back to the 1950s, when he was recruited as a CIA informant while studying at a military academy in Peru. Noriega rose through the ranks of the Panamanian armed forces and became a key supporter of General Omar Torrijos, the military ruler who signed a treaty with the United States in 1977 to restore the Panama Canal zone to Panamanian sovereignty. After Torrijos's death in 1981, Noriega became the power behind the scenes as head of the security services. The US relied on Panama as a regional listening post and Noriega obliged with unfaltering support for the Contras in Nicaragua and in the fight against the FMLN guerrillas in El Salvador.
