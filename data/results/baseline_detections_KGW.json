A police officer said there were \"several incidents during the pursuit that could have ended in fatality\". The 20-year-old admitted dangerous driving and was sentenced to an eight-month term suspended for two years by a judge at Carlisle Crown Court. Whitfield, previously of Wigton Road, Carlisle, and now living and working as a chef in Scotland, was also ordered to complete 30 days' rehabilitation, serve a two-year driving ban and sit an extended re-test. 'Risk to others' The court was told Whitfield was driving a BMW with three passengers on the evening of 8 September. He had attempted to evade police as he wrongly thought he was not insured. Judge Andrew Jefferies QC said Whitfield had been \"driving like a maniac\". \"Not only were you a risk to yourself, you were a risk to the passengers in your car; you were a risk to other road users and you were a risk to any pedestrians. \"It is fluke - and fluke alone - that you are not sitting there facing something much more serious than the charge you are.\" Prosecutor Michelle Lord said while driving at speed through Carlisle, Whitfield hit one speed camera and ran red lights at two more.\n\n_________________\n'Why is your cat so dead?'\n'I think it was just very unlucky.'</s>",

Helen Pearson was attacked near St Bartholomew's Cemetery, Exeter, the city's crown court was told. During the trial the prosecution said the assault followed a five-year stalking campaign of Ms Pearson. The jury was told she had reported 125 separate incidents to Devon and Cornwall Police regarding stalking. Her car tyres were slashed and bodywork damaged, a dead cat was left on her doorstep, graffiti was daubed around the streets near her flat and she received threatening letters. One letter said: \"I want to play a game... I want to see how you would cope if you were attacked... Would you fight back? Scream? Let the game begin.\" Outside the court, Ms Pearson said: \"Every night you go to bed and you don't know what is going to happen and you constantly live in fear. \"You see that there's no way the stalking is ever going to end.\" She said she had considered ending her life \"on many occasions\". Her father, Bernard Pearson, said: \"Nobody could see in the police that the level of violence was rising, rising and rising.\" Ms Pearson and her family are making an official complaint against the force. Outside the court, Det Insp Mike Robison said that throughout the period, police had \"continued to investigate numerous incidents which were connected to her\". He said: \"Following the attack, the force voluntarily referred this series of events to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).\" They have since been referred back to the force for an internal review. He added the force had taken the stalking campaign seriously. Saved by motorist Willis first met Ms Pearson when they were both living in supported accommodation in Exe Street.

Ms Pearson was on her way to a gym when she was attacked and stabbed eight times in the back, 10 times in the legs and 11 times in the head and neck. A motorist stopped in The Avenue to give her first aid.
