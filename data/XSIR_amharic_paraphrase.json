French Green Party is in the headlines once again, this time because of a high profile member who has been accused of sexual harassment by two female members of the party. The incident is particularly embarrassing for the party, as the accused member is a senior politician and is married to the French minister of environment, both of whom belong to the same party faction that is in favor of working more closely with the French President. In recent weeks, the party has been plagued by internal divisions and conflict, and the timing of the revelations has raised questions about the motives of the accusers and the reasons behind the timing of the allegations. Despite the seriousness of the claims, some observers have questioned the timing of the revelations, suggesting that the accusers may have been motivated by political reasons rather than concerns about the conduct of the accused member. The French Green Party has always been at the forefront of the fight against sexism, and the party has been vocal in its opposition to sexual harassment and other forms of gender discrimination. However, the party has been rocked by internal divisions and conflicts in recent weeks, and the timing of the revelations has raised questions about the motives of the accusers and the reasons behind the timing of the allegations. Despite the seriousness of the claims, some observers have questioned the timing of the revelations, suggesting that the accusers may have been motivated by political reasons rather than concerns about the conduct of the accused member.","1":"Frank Grenier, from North Cadbury, engraved the 58 panels of the tapestry and an English description of each major event. It took him six months to complete his work. The crystal dish is to be used in an Autumn exhibition at Glastonbury Abbey. Mr Grenier, who has been engraving for 20 years, studied under Simon Whistler, son of the famous glass engraver Lawrence Whistler. The original Bayeux Tapestry is said to be the most important image of the 11th century. It depicts the events leading up to the Norman conquest of England by William the Conqueror against his opponent Harold, Earl of Wessex, and culminates in the Battle of Hastings. The dish will be centerpiece of the Reflections On Glass display at Glastonbury Abbey which opens on 5 October.","2":"In this BBC Wales news article, Aled ap Dafydd summarizes the key points of the Plaid Cymru leadership election and the potential coalitions that Plaid Cymru might consider entering into after the 2021 Welsh election. The article focuses on the candidates, Adam Price and Rhun ap Iorwerth, and their positions on potential coalitions. Adam Price, who is challenging Leanne Wood for the leadership, states that Plaid Cymru should focus on building a positive message and that the idea of a coalition involving Plaid Cymru after the election should be \"taken off the table.\" He emphasizes that Plaid Cymru must win in order to move forward, and that the party has been stagnating under Leanne Wood's leadership. Rhun ap Iorwerth, the other challenger, also questions whether Plaid Cymru should enter into a coalition, but stops short of ruling out the possibility completely. Leanne Wood, the current leader, states that Plaid Cymru should not enter into a coalition with either Labour or the Conservatives, but leaves the door open for other potential coalitions. The Welsh Government served as the junior partner in a coalition with Labour from 2007 to 2011, and Adam Price states that he would not consider entering into a coalition with either party in the future. Plaid Cymru has been polling at 17 points behind Labour, and Adam Price states that the party needs to change its strategy in order to win in the upcoming election. Plaid Cymru's ultimate vision is to achieve independence, and Adam Price states that the party should not be afraid to use the 'I' word to inspire voters. Plaid Cymru has been criticized for not using the 'I' word in the past, but Adam Price argues that people respond to passion and dreams, and that Plaid Cymru should not be afraid to pursue its ultimate vision of independence. Adam Price states that Welsh politics is devoid of ideas and that Plaid Cymru should pursue its vision of independence to drive the nation forward. The Plaid Cymru leadership election will be announced on September 28th, and the outcome will determine the direction of the party in the upcoming election and beyond.","3":"The National Trust has received approval from Anglesey council to build a rope bridge over the A4080 at Llanfairpwll, Anglesey in order to create safer conditions for red squirrels. These red squirrels have been negatively affected by the risk of getting killed by cars while crossing the road, which is why the National Trust is building the bridge.\n\nAccording to Iwan Ellis-Roberts of the National Trust, tens of red squirrels are run over each year on the road, which is part of efforts to boost red squirrel numbers. The National Trust is hoping the bridge will be ready by autumn of this year, as part of a \u00a310,000 plan that also includes a new squirrel hide and nest boxes.\n\nHolly Peek, a Red Squirrels Trust Wales ranger, believes the bridge will encourage red squirrels to safely scamper to new habitats. The National Trust is in the process of raising the cash for the project, but there are some risks associated with the bridge as red squirrels could come into contact with greys, which carry a disease that is deadly to red squirrels.\n\nDespite the risks, the National Trust believes the bridge will be effective in improving the situation for red squirrels in the area, and is hoping to monitor the effectiveness of the project through the use of camera traps on the bridge.\n\nAuthor:\n\nTodd","4":"The article reports about the opening of Charles Dickens\u2019s former residence, which was the birthplace of some of his most important novels.

Despite the police's efforts to identify his body, it took over a year to establish his identity, and a pathologist said the most likely cause of death was strychnine poisoning. The coroner, Simon Nelson, said that although he accepted Mr. Lytton had taken his own life, the only conclusion he could reach was an open conclusion. The article also mentions that police ruled out any suspicious circumstances, but the coroner said that some fundamental questions remained unanswered. Additionally, the inquest at Rochdale Coroner's Court was told that Mr. Lytton had been in Pakistan for ten years and had flown to London Heathrow two days before his body was found, despite having no known links to the area. The police traced his next of kin and his identity was eventually confirmed following a DNA match with his mother, and his passport photo was also found to match an artist's impression of a man who had been found at Dove Stone Reservoir. Strychnine is most commonly used as mole poison, and traces of the substance were found in a medicine bottle found with Mr. Lytton's body. Finally, the article mentions that Mr. Lytton had changed his name in 1986 from his birth name, David Lautenberg.","10":"The Marmalade Festival at Dalemain, near Penrith in Cumbria, has been a popular event for many years, attracting entries from around the world. The 2020 festival saw entries from Canada, Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Malta, and Mexico, and the overall winner was Beth Furnell from Flintshire, Wales. She was awarded \"Double Gold\" for her marmalade, which was made from Seville oranges. Other winners included Christina Ewing from Glasgow in the \"Octogenarian's Marmalade\" category, Reuben Kooperman from Australia in the \"Man Made Marmalade\" category, and Yasuyo Imamura from Japan in the \"International Marmalade\" category. Kooperman has been making marmalade for over 50 years and uses fruit from his own garden and those of friends, while Imamura learned about the competition from an English conversation teacher and has been making marmalade for three years. The competition was launched by Jane Hasell-McCosh, and has been \"wildly popular\" in Japan, leading to the launch of a sister competition in Yawatahama in May. The awards have been \"so privileged\" during these polarising times, and many of the entries included variations of the traditional Seville oranges, such as ginger, chilli, passion fruit, pineapple, potato vodka, mango, sake, and prosecco. The winning recipe is sold at Fortnum & Mason, and entries are open to anyone who wants to participate.","11":"More than 50 firefighters were called to Deptford Terrace shortly after 18:00 BST to deal with the blaze at a disused recycling facility. It created a plume of smoke that could be seen several miles away. A Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service spokesman described the fire as \u201cextremely challenging\u201d. Smoke from the fire could be seen as far as Redcar on Teesside and on social media people reported seeing it in Hartlepool and Newcastle.\n\nThere were no reported injuries. Assistant chief fire officer Alan Robson said: \u201cThere are still some very deep seated areas of fire within the building, which makes this extremely challenging. \u201cThe waste itself is around 4m (13ft) high, so that\u2019s the size of a normal house and the building is more than 100m (328ft) long. \u201cAt this point we are looking at this going for some considerable time yet.

The concept is gaining popularity as people look for ways to save money on products that may be more expensive in their home country or not available at all. The reporter introduces two entrepreneurs, Frederic Simons and Guillaume Cayard, who launched Worldcraze, one of three similar firms, in 2012. The idea behind Worldcraze is simple: travellers can earn money by bringing back items from abroad, and the company takes a small fee from both parties involved in the transaction.\n\nThe reporter gives examples of the items that travellers have brought back, including food, clothing, and even construction materials. The reporter also mentions the potential risks of using informal couriers, such as loss or damage of the items, and the possibility of legal issues if the items are found to be illegal or banned in the country of origin or destination.\n\nOverall, the article is informative and engaging, and provides useful information on how people can save money on items from abroad, while also earning extra income on the side.","17":"In the last 2 decades the energy market in the United Kingdom has undergone a revolution in the form of privatization. In the 90\u2019s the energy sector was deregulated allowing multiple players to enter the market in the form of new suppliers. The big six however still account for 90% of the market and the government is currently in the process of creating a level field for new players to enter the market.\n\nThe big six energy suppliers however has been a major cause of concern for the government as the prices of energy have been on the rise in the past few months. The government on the other hand has been working on a strategy to lower the prices of energy by allowing new players to enter the market. The government has also been successful in lowering the environmental charges on monthly bills.\n\nThe prime minister said he wanted a 'big 60' energy market, with greater choice for consumers and \"healthy\" competition keeping prices down. In order to achieve this target the government has been in talks with energy suppliers on how to attract new suppliers into the market. The government has been successful in attracting new suppliers to enter the market however the government still aims to get even more new suppliers into the market.\n\nThe government in the meantime has also been looking at the interest that energy suppliers make on the money they receive from the monthly direct debits of the consumer. This move by the government has also been backed by the media who has been critical of the energy suppliers making money on money that the consumer pays to the suppliers to pay the monthly bills on time. The government is also concerned about the interest that energy suppliers make on the money received from the monthly direct debits of the consumer.\n\nThe government however rejects the idea of a price freeze on energy bills as it feels that a price freeze would hurt the economy in the long term as it would discourage energy suppliers from entering the market and investing in the energy sector. The government on the other hand feels that the best way to tackle the problem of high energy prices is to focus on the competition in the energy sector and look at ways to reduce the environmental charges levied on the monthly bills.\n\nThe prime minister said he wanted a 'big 60' energy market, with greater choice for consumers and \"healthy\" competition keeping prices down.

Although DNA sequencing has been unable to determine the puppy\u2019s species, scientists believe it could be a key evolutionary link between wolves and modern dogs. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the puppy was two months old when it died and that it has been frozen in permafrost for thousands of years. Genome analyses show that the puppy was male, and scientists hope to learn more about the evolution of dogs through DNA sequencing. The puppy has been named \u201cDogor,\u201d which means \u201cfriend\u201d in the Yakut language.

The image is taken in the northern Syrian city of Raqa and the caption reads \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d Another photo shows Sharrouf wearing combat fatigues posing with three children, believed to be his sons. The image has shocked the world and raised concerns about the barbaric practices of the Islamic State militants. The Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, has said that the image is a reminder of how barbaric the Islamic State is and that the militants are not just a terrorist group, but a terrorist army seeking to establish a terrorist state in the Middle East. The Prime Minister has also said that this poses extraordinary problems not just for the people of the Middle East, but also for the wider world. Last week, Australia announced laws that would restrict its citizens from travelling to certain countries to prevent radicalised nationals from fighting with extremist groups overseas. The Prime Minister has also announced that the government will give back-up assistance to the United States in the fight against the Islamic State militants.","21":"The Scottish government is proposing to end the requirement for corroboration in criminal prosecutions.

However, some legal experts fear that this move could increase the likelihood of miscarriages of justice.\n\nArticle:\nBy Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland news\n\nThe Scottish government is proposing to end the requirement for corroboration in criminal prosecutions. This is an ancient legal principle that requires at least two pieces of evidence to prove guilt in a criminal trial.\n\nThe top prosecutor, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, thinks that this requirement is denying access to justice to victims of crimes committed in private. In particular, he points to the high number of rape and sexual assault cases that do not proceed to trial because of insufficient evidence.\n\nHowever, some legal experts fear that this move could increase the likelihood of miscarriages of justice. In particular, the former Lord President of the Court of Session, Lord Hamilton, and the former senior judge, Lord Cullen, have expressed concern about the risk of wrongful convictions without corroboration.\n\nLord Hamilton said that the need for corroboration is an essential element of the Scottish system. In a separate interview, Lord Cullen said that corroboration could be a safeguard against wrongful conviction.\n\nThe Scottish government has said that it intends to press ahead with the proposed reforms despite the concerns of legal experts. However, it has indicated that it may consider more limited reforms, such as allowing a trial judge to suspend the need for corroboration in certain cases.\n\nIn conclusion, the Scottish government's proposal to end the requirement for corroboration in criminal prosecutions is controversial and divisive. While some argue that it is necessary to improve access to justice for victims of crimes committed in private, others fear that it could increase the risk of wrongful convictions. The final decision on the issue will likely depend on the balance of arguments and the political will of the government.\n\nAuthor: Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland news\n\nPublished on: Thu Feb 23 2023\n\nLast Updated on: Wed Mar 08 2023\n\n### Related Articles\n\n#### Articles\n\nBy: Glen","22":"In the article, the author is discussing the Cuban revolution, and how a member of the family that started the revolution has passed on his position to a person who is not from his family.

The Conservatives, on the other hand, are expected to win the popular vote but have not translated that into seats. The New Democratic Party (NDP) is also expected to win 24 seats in the election, despite a decline in the number of seats they won in the past election. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which competes only in Quebec, fared much better in the election and is expected to win 32 seats. The election is seen as a referendum on the current Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, who has had a bumpy first term in office. The election results saw a sharp decline in seats for the country's left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), despite the party's leader, Jagmeet Singh, potentially becoming the kingmaker in the election. Turnout in the election is currently listed at 66%. The federal election was seen as a referendum on Mr Trudeau, who had a bumpy first term in office, tainted by scandal. Mr Trudeau told cheering supporters in Montreal that voters had \"rejected division and negativity... and they rejected cuts and austerity and voted in favour of a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change\". He said: \"Thank you for having faith in us to move our country in the right direction.\" And to those who did not back him, he promised his party would govern for everyone. Despite Mr Trudeau's weakened grip on power, the result is bitterly disappointing for Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. The Liberal Party of Canada's popularity has fallen in recent years, in part due to a number of scandals that have tarnished the party's image. The party also faced criticism for its inability to follow through on some of its progressive promises, such as the promise to institute federal electoral reform. Nevertheless, the Liberal Party of Canada won the election and will form the next government of Canada.\n\nPosted in Politics, Government & Law and tagged Political Ideologies, Elections.","25":"The Save the Children report showed that youngsters from poorer backgrounds were more likely to start primary school with developmental difficulties. The research was based on 3,000 children aged five from different socio-economic backgrounds in Scotland. The study found that poorer children were more likely to have emotional and physical development difficulties. They were also more likely to have problems with communication and expressing themselves or making themselves understood. The report's authors said poorer youngsters were more likely to face difficulties mixing with other children and were more likely to be behind in their cognitive development. Douglas Hamilton, Save the Children's head in Scotland, said that the long-term ramifications of these developmental difficulties for children in poverty were very serious. To discover that this 'developmental divide' begins before a child even starts school is incredibly worrisome. The organization said figures from later in the education system showed that these children begin their school life behind their classmates and never catch up. The charity, which carried out the study with Scotcen Social Research, wants the Scottish government to take a number of measures to better support children in their early years. The spokesman for the Scottish government said that it is completely unacceptable that any child in Scotland lives in poverty. This government is doing all we can within the devolved powers to tackle this problem head on, and we will continue to work with our partners to make sure that every child in Scotland has the best possible start in life.\n\nPosted on: Sun, 07 May 2023 03:39:00 +0000\n\n\u00a9 2010-2023 grouples.com","26":"SUMMARIZE THE ARTICLE IN 5 TO 10 SENTENCES\n\nThe Ukrainian government said it had raised 550m euros of the 740m euros ($1bn; \u00a3600m) it needed to finance a massive new radiation shield.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Viktor Yanukovych said this was a \u201cpreliminary\u201d figure.\n\nChernobyl, the world\u2019s worst nuclear accident, sent a plume of radiation over large parts of Europe.\n\n\u201cThe catastrophe at Chernobyl power station left a deep wound that Ukraine will need to live with for many years ahead,\u201d Mr Yanukovych said at the conference in Kiev.\n\n\u201cWe thank the international community for not leaving Ukraine alone with this problem.\u201d\n\nMr Yanukovych said that to turn Chernobyl into an \u201cecologically safe site,\u201d it was necessary \u201cto build a new sarcophagus around the damaged reactor as well as a secure storage facility for spent nuclear fuel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe catastrophe has affected millions of people; thousands died and tens of thousands continue to suffer,\u201d Mr Yanukovych said.\n\nAccording to a UN report, considered the most comprehensive to date on the disaster\u2019s health impact, Chernobyl directly caused the deaths of 30 workers and radiation injuries to more than 100 others.\n\nSubsequently, more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer were reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at the time of the accident in Ukraine and Russia, with many of these cancers \u201cmost likely caused by radiation exposures shortly after the accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from this increase, there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure two decades after the accident,\u201d the UN assessment adds.\n\nGigantic shell\n\nThe conference, and a summit on nuclear power being held afterwards, coincide with preparations for the 25th anniversary of the accident next week.\n\nThe conference has been planned for years, but has gained new impetus with the continuing emergency at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan.\n\nUkraine\u2019s government, along with the European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is building a gigantic new shell to surround the damaged","27":"Article:\n\nBy Tim Masters Entertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News Winning seven out of the eight awards it was nominated for, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time matched Matilda the Musical's record haul last year.

The play is booking until January 2014, but it could be around a lot longer if the track record of its director Marianne Elliott - who staged the National Theatre's breakout hit War Horse - is anything to go by. \"It was an experimental journey, and like War Horse, we could not have done it anywhere else other than a properly subsidised theatre, because it was a risk,\" Elliott told the BBC backstage at the Royal Opera House, clutching her award for best director. \"Everyone, including the creative team, were working outside their comfort zones. \"You have to be allowed to take risks and that means being allowed to fail and that means being allowed to try new things.\" It was no surprise to hear words like this at the end of a week when Culture Secretary Maria Miller called on the arts world to make the case for public funding by focusing on its economic, not artistic, value.

The pastel picture was bought by the States of Guernsey in 2009 and will be displayed in the Riverbrink Art Museum in Ontario, close to the site of the Queenston battlefield and a monument to Brock. Brock was killed in action while defending Upper Canada against an invasion by the United States of America at the Battle of Queenston Heights in 1812, and is believed to be the only likeness of him as an adult in existence. He led the defence of Upper Canada after America declared war on Britain in 1812, and is responsible for the capture of Detroit, as well as organizing reinforcements to defend against an American attack on Queenston Heights, during which he was killed midway through the battle. The battle was the largest clash of the war up to that point, and ended with much of the American militia being forced to surrender when cut off from the rest of the army.","29":"On 29 June 2009, at Bristol Crown Court, a man was found guilty of the murder of 47-year-old Mikhail Hanid in Weston-super-Mare on 27 June 2007.\n\nSamuel Ford, 30, of Weston-super-Mare, and his brother Curtis Ford, 28, both of no fixed address, were found guilty of murder and manslaughter respectively.\n\nCurtis Ford has been ordered to serve a minimum of 26 years in jail and Samuel Ford 9 years.\n\nThe jury heard that Mr Hanid was found lying in the gutter in Ridgeway Avenue in Weston-super-Mare on 27 June 2007 at around 0400hrs.\n\nThe victim had suffered 11 stab wounds to his chest and legs and had lost a significant amount of blood.\n\nThe jury was told that the brothers went looking for the victim on 25 June 2007 in the area of where the victim lived in Weston-super-Mare.\n\nTheir motivation for this attack was that the victim had been in the company of Lizzie Crow on 25 June 2007 and Lizzie Crow had also been in the company of Samuel Ford on the same date.\n\nThe victim and Lizzie Crow then went to Weston-super-Mare on 25 June 2007 and the victim lost his bike on that date and it was returned to the police on 27 June 2007.\n\nThe victim and his family lived in Ridgeway Avenue in Weston-super-Mare and his family members described him as a 'warm, kind hearted and interesting person' who was 'brutally killed in a senseless and hateful attack'.\n\nIn a trial that ran from 2 June 2009 to 29 June 2009 at Bristol Crown Court, the jury found Samuel Ford guilty of murder and found Curtis Ford guilty of the same charge.\n\nThe jury also found Samuel Ford guilty of the charge of wounding with intent and found Samuel Ford not guilty of the charge of robbery.\n\nFurther Information:\n\nHanid family pay emotional tribute to victim","30":"The Dyfed-Powys Police took into custody a 50-year-old man on suspicion of public order offences following a disturbance at Penally, Pembrokeshire, on Monday. The entrance to the base was blocked, and First Minister Mark Drakeford said it had become a target for \"hard-right extremist protesters\". Proposals could see 230 people housed at the base until claims are processed. The base was used by the army and Ministry of Defence until the Home Office took it over on Monday. The move by the UK government has not been discussed with the Welsh Government, and has brought a number of protests. These have been organised by groups who are against the move and others who said they welcome asylum seekers but believe the base is unsuitable for them.\n\nOn Tuesday night, there was another protest at the site that involved 40 people, with \"minimal disturbances and no further arrests\". On Wednesday morning, there was also a gathering of people supportive of asylum seekers.

It means she feels virtually no pain, and never feels anxious or afraid. It wasn\u2019t until she was 65 she realised she was different - when doctors couldn\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t need painkillers after a serious operation. When she had surgery on her hand, doctors warned her she should expect pain afterwards. When she felt nothing, her anaesthetist - Dr Devjit Srivastava - sent her to pain geneticists at University College London (UCL) and Oxford University. After tests, they found gene mutations which meant that she did not feel pain like most people. Not just \u2018incredibly healthy\u2019 Jo, from Whitebridge, near Inverness, told the BBC Scotland news website that doctors didn\u2019t believe her when she said she wouldn\u2019t need pain relief after surgery. She said: \u201cWe had banter before theatre when I guaranteed I wouldn\u2019t need painkillers. \u201cWhen he found I hadn\u2019t had any, he checked my medical history and found I had never asked for painkillers.\u201d That\u2019s when she was referred to specialists in England.

In order to inform the public of the potential risks of such pathogens, two different groups of scientists designed experiments to test whether or not avian strains of the flu could become transmissible between mammals, and to estimate the potential danger to humans in the event of such transmission.\n\nThe first group of researchers, from the Netherlands, created two different types of mutant strains of influenza in order to test whether or not they could cause mammals to become ill. The first strain caused no symptoms at all, and the second strain caused only mild symptoms, and the ferrets that were exposed to either strain did not pass the mutant strains onto other ferrets, meaning that the mutant strains could not be transmitted between mammals, and thus did not pose a threat to humans.\n\nThe second group of researchers, from the United States, created mutant strains of the flu that could cause symptoms in ferrets, and in fact, some of the ferrets in this second study died as a result of exposure to the mutant strains of the flu. In addition, some of the ferrets who were exposed to the mutant strains of the flu did pass on the mutant strains to other ferrets, meaning that the mutant strains of the flu could be transmitted between mammals, and thus posed a threat to humans.\n\nThe United States National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) has recommended that the results of the second study of mutant strains of the flu not be made public, because the second study of mutant strains of the flu could be used to create mutant strains of the flu that could pose a threat to humans, and the NSABB feels that the benefits of creating mutant strains of the flu in the laboratory do not outweigh the dangers of creating mutant strains of the flu in the laboratory, and the benefits of publishing the second study of mutant strains of the flu in the laboratory do not outweigh the dangers of creating mutant strains of the flu in the laboratory, and the benefits of publishing the second study of mut","36":"The article focuses on the topic of the Isle of Man TT, a motorcycle race that takes place on the island of the same name. The article reports that 7 motorcycle enthusiasts died in the TT period, 3 of whom died in scheduled races, and 4 who crashed on the open road. The latest victim was riding a red Yamaha bike which collided with an Alfa Romeo on the main Douglas to Ballasalla Road at Santon, near Fairy Bridge. The occupants of the car were uninjured in the crash at 1955 BST on Monday. The police spokesman said that the number of deaths was usual for the TT period, and that roads are closed to general traffic during scheduled races, but non-competition riders \"have been known to travel at high speeds on the island's open roads\". The spokesman said that the island has no maximum speed limit, although there have been a number of failed attempts to introduce one over the years, and that the police expect riders to use their common sense and not travel at high speeds if they cannot see what is coming towards them. The latest victim's next of kin are being sought by police before his details can be released, and the latest competitive rider to be killed was Derek Brien, 34, from Ireland who crashed in the first Supersport race on Monday.\n\nLast edited:\n\n#### 759540754\n\n##### Active Member\n\n    Jun 3, 2007\n    3,539\n    5\n    Germany\n    www.theinternetismyenemy.de\n\n> Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The study found that the number of people affected by the radioactive fallout from the tests was almost the entire population at the time, which was approximately 110,000 people. The study also found that the French military underestimated the amount of radiation exposure that the local population experienced as a result of the nuclear tests conducted between 1966 and 1974. The 41st test in 1974 was particularly significant as the atomic cloud took a different trajectory than planned, exposing the local population to significant amounts of ionizing radiation. The area where the tests were conducted was home to 110,000 people, and the radiation exposure from the tests was between two and 10 times higher than the estimates provided by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in a 2006 report. One of the reasons for the discrepancy between the CEA report and the study's findings is that the CEA did not always take into account the drinking of contaminated rainwater when calculating the dose of radiation that individuals were likely to have been exposed to. The study also found that eight members of one family developed cancer as a result of the nuclear tests conducted in French Polynesia. The CEA study was used as the basis for determining whether people were eligible for compensation from the French government as a result of the nuclear tests, and the study's findings suggest that the amount of compensation provided to affected individuals may not be sufficient to cover the damage caused by the nuclear tests. In conclusion, the study conducted by the researchers found that the French nuclear tests in French Polynesia exposed the local population to significantly higher levels of radiation than previously thought, and that the French government may need to provide more compensation to affected individuals as a result.\n\n#\n\n#### Top Answer\n\nParagraph 1: The French nuclear tests in French Polynesia exposed the local...

However, Eurotunnel has appealed the decision, and as a result, the order has been put on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. The CMA's ruling was based on the fact that MyFerryLink had more than half of the market share on the Dover-Calais route when its rail link was taken into consideration, making it a monopoly in the sector. MyFerryLink, on the other hand, maintains that it does not operate on the Dover-Calais route itself, but instead leases ships to other operators, making it unnecessary to include its rail link in the CMA's assessment.\n\nMyFerryLink argues that its business model benefits other shipping companies by giving them access to ships on the Dover-Calais route, allowing them to avoid high fixed costs. Eurotunnel claims to be making a loss on MyFerryLink, as the service is subsidizing its passenger service on the same route. Eurotunnel says that MyFerryLink is losing money on the Dover-Calais route and is in breach of the conditions of its lease agreements. The CMA has agreed to look into Eurotunnel's claims, but it is still considering the appeal of MyFerryLink's suspension order.\n\nMyFerryLink has been operating since 2012 and has up to 24 daily crossings on the Dover-Calais route. Eurotunnel bought three ships from SeaFrance in 2012 and MyFerryLink took over the operation of these ships, giving Eurotunnel access to half of the market on the Dover-Calais route. However, Eurotunnel claims that MyFerryLink is losing money on the Dover-Calais route and is in breach of the conditions of its lease agreements.\n\nEurotunnel maintains that MyFerryLink's operation of passenger services on the same route subsidizes the Dover-Calais route, but MyFerryLink argues that it only makes money on the passenger service and not on the Dover-Calais route.

Thousands of his supporters had gathered at another Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted to Sheremetyevo airport. Mr. Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year, while the Kremlin denies any role. The European Union, France, and Italy expressed concern over his detention and called for his immediate release, as did the incoming national security adviser to US President-elect Joe Biden. On January 17, the same day as his return to Russia, Alexei Navalny was poisoned on an internal flight in Siberia and was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment as he recovered. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia and on Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. The plane was packed with journalists and as the pilot announced that the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers, the extra police were deployed and metal barriers erected at the airport in Moscow. Despite the warnings and the pleas from his lawyer, Alexei Navalny was detained by the police officers and kissed his wife Yulia just before his arrest and taken to the police station in Moscow.","47":"Andrew Hancock, a man from Nottinghamshire, bought a scratchcard from a local petrol station while he was there to buy food for his six-year-old ginger tomcat, Shorty.

Neath Port Talbot council, Arriva Trains Wales, and Network Rail will submit a joint bid in December through the government's station improvement program. Work is expected to start next autumn and last for 18 months. Approximately 500,000 passengers use the station annually, and the improvements will greatly enhance the gateway to the town center. Ali Thomas, the leader of Neath Port Talbot council, says that the project will make a massive improvement to the town and is worth the wait. In the 1960s, the station underwent major refurbishment, and in the 1980s, it was designated as a Parkway, with the old goods shed and yard converted to a large car park. Under the new design by BDP, the station will have an enclosed footbridge, and lifts providing step-free access to the platform will be installed. There will also be a new ticket office, waiting areas, a cafe, retail area, improved customer information, CCTV, and a 200-space car park with a park and ride for commuters, along with improved facilities for cyclists, bus passengers, and taxis. The council is in talks with Port Talbot-based Tata Steel about providing the 90 tonnes of steel needed to construct the framework. Jon Ferriman, director of Tata Steel, says that the investment in Port Talbot's Parkway station is great, and they continually seek to support their local communities in many ways through events, school activities, and environmental projects.","50":"In this article, the author discusses the government\u2019s decision to change the formula for calculating compensation payments for those who suffer long-term injuries in the UK. The author explains that the new formula prompted anger from the insurance industry, as premiums had risen as a result of the change. The author also notes that the government has had a re-think on the issue and has now published new draft legislation that would change the way the so-called discount rate is calculated. This legislation would need to be agreed by Parliament, which the author says could take months, not weeks. The author also explains how the insurance industry works in terms of accident victims\u2019 payouts, as well as the current formula for calculating the discount rate. The author also mentions that the British Insurance Brokers\u2019 Association argued that victims would pick better investments than government bonds, which the government took into consideration in the new legislation. The author also notes that the new legislation could also mean that insurance premiums could fall slightly, but compensation payouts could also fall too. The author also mentions that the government\u2019s decision to change the formula for calculating compensation payments was determined by existing law, as the formula assumes the victim will invest his or her money in government bonds.\n\n## Get access to knowledge base\n\nGuarantee No Hidden\nCharges Unlimited\nKnowledge base","51":"Bishop Peter Ball, who is facing charges of sexual assault and indecent assault, is set to stand trial in October at the Old Bailey in London.

This change has caused some concerns among older women who feel that they were not given enough time to prepare for the increased retirement age. In order to address these concerns, a legal action was brought by a group of women who felt that the changes to the retirement age were discriminatory. The High Court ruled in favor of the government, finding that the changes to the retirement age were lawful and did not discriminate on the basis of age or sex.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling in favor of the government was based on the fact that the changes to the retirement age were part of a larger policy of pension age equality between men and women. The court found that the changes to the retirement age did not discriminate on the basis of age or sex, as the changes applied equally to men and women. The court also found that the changes to the retirement age were justified on the grounds of fiscal sustainability, as the government\u2019s pension scheme is facing a shortfall in funding.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling has been welcomed by the government, who have argued that the changes to the retirement age are necessary to ensure the long-term fiscal sustainability of the pension scheme.

The committee is also requesting the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to appear in Parliament to clarify its position on the issue. The committee is also requesting the new health secretary to answer the questions raised by the committee members. The issue of mesh implants in pelvic surgery has been a controversial topic in the recent past. The issue was first raised in June last year by the then Scottish health secretary, Alex Neil, who urged the 14 health boards to stop the procedure while a review was carried out. Some women with the implants, which are used to ease incontinence, have suffered painful complications. The committee is concerned that some health boards have not halted the procedure despite the warning by the health secretary. The committee is also concerned that the MHRA is set to recommend that the benefits of the operation outweigh the risk, despite the fact that there is evidence of under reporting and there are concerns that the MHRA is not aware of all women who have experienced problems. The committee is of the view that this could potentially be a \"dramatic obstacle\" to the progress that has been made in the past. The committee has also expressed its concern that the MHRA is recommending the use of mesh implants despite the fact that the risks outweigh the benefits. The MHRA has said that its research shows that while a small number of women have experienced distressing effects, the benefits of the tapes and meshes \"outweigh the risks\" and can help in dealing with upsetting conditions such as urinary stress incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The issue has been further complicated by the fact that the mesh implants are now being used in some health boards as part of a clinical trial.

Those on the party\u2019s left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worried whether the party\u2019s positioning on the issue is right.\nIan Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir\u2019s call for any council tax increases to be scrapped. But in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families. And in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives. Now one thing that unites all three former shadow ministers was their dismissal from the frontbench when Sir Keir assumed the leadership. The left of the party have been increasingly critical of Sir Keir\u2014especially over the suspension of former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But they are now becoming more vocal on policy and positioning rather than personalities. There are now concerns that as the country emerges from the pandemic, some of the radical policies on which Sir Keir was elected by his membership\u2014including increasing taxes on the better off\u2014will be diluted. Some of those who know the Labour leader well suggest that these concerns are misplaced. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has signalled that Labour is open to increasing taxes on business in future. More immediately, the relatively new Labour leadership want to prove their pro-business credentials and to give a clear, unmuddied message that securing the recovery is the party\u2019s priority. Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett say they have consulted more than 1,000 activists and are giving the grassroots a voice. Support for wealth taxes runs strong amongst Labour supporters, they say, and the leadership\u2019s position on council tax is not as popular as council tax on property and business taxes.\n\nLast modified: December 22, 2020","83":"In the recent decision by the Australian Federal Court, J&J subsidiary Ethicon failed to warn patients and surgeons about the risks posed by the mesh products that were commonly used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth. The court found that the information provided by the company was inaccurate at times and made false representations about the risks of the mesh products. The ruling is one of a series of lawsuits that J&J faces over the mesh products, which have been linked to severe complications such as chronic pain, bleeding, and discomfort during sexual intercourse. The court awarded damages to the claimant, Julie Davis, who had suffered as a result of the mesh products. Ethicon defended its record and said it would consider appealing the decision, but the Australian government issued a national apology to women affected by the mesh in 2022, acknowledging decades of pain and suffering caused by the mesh products. Mounting lawsuits over the mesh products in other countries, as well as lawsuits over other products such as opioids and talc, continue to pose a threat to the company's reputation and financial stability.","84":"The prime minister of the United Kingdom has been in power for over a month, and in that time he has been in power for over a month.

The attacks on the Red Cross also violate international law as it amounts to looting and pillaging under international law, the group said.

This decision comes in the wake of a series of political setbacks faced by the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), including losses in state parliament elections in Bavaria and Hesse. The CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, saw a ten point drop in support in the recent election in the state of Hesse. This is the latest in a series of losses suffered by the major centre parties following the 2017 general election, as parties like the left-leaning Greens and the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) have gained in popularity. Merkel has faced criticism from some in her party over her decision to welcome over a million refugees into the country in 2015, and the growing support for right-wing populist parties has been seen as a backlash against this policy. Despite these setbacks, Merkel has insisted that she will continue to lead the country until the end of her term in December, and has said that she will not make any decisions about her political future until that time.\n\nDo not write in point form; write in complete sentences and try to capture the essence of the article in no more than 5 to 10 sentences.","96":"North Korea has recently tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, in a provocative move that has heightened tensions in the region. Here is what we know about the missile and the images surrounding its launch: The rocket is enormous: Photos and videos of the launch and images of the rocket itself have shown that the Hwasong-15 is a massive weapon, dwarfing its predecessor, the Hwasong-14, and raising questions about its range and payload capacity. North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is a viable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM): North Korea has been developing ICBMs as part of its weapons program, and the launch of the Hwasong-15 is seen as a major step in this direction. However, some experts have questioned the reliability of North Korea\u2019s claims and whether the missile is truly capable of carrying a nuclear warhead to targets in the United States or other countries. North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is a viable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). There is a new transporter: Photos and videos of the launch showed that the rocket was transported on a nine-axle vehicle, indicating that North Korea has developed a more sophisticated launch platform than in previous tests. This is seen as a step towards making North Korea\u2019s missiles more mobile and harder to detect by opponents.

The law was passed unanimously by Welsh assembly members, who acknowledged the importance of the measure in saving lives and making people safer. The legislation was drawn down from Westminster, giving the Welsh government the power to make this law. Ms Jones appealed to AMs to support the legislation, arguing that the installation of sprinkler systems in homes and other buildings could save lives, prevent firefighters from entering burning buildings, and make people safer. She also noted that the law is in line with the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, which requires fire services to consider the installation of sprinkler systems in high-risk buildings. The legislation was supported by the fire and rescue services, the Chief Fire Officers Association, the Fire Brigades Union, the National Fire Sprinkler Network, and other sprinkler campaigners. The NHBC, however, expressed some concerns about the cost effectiveness of the measure and whether existing water pressures would enable sprinklers to work in many homes.

Instead, focusing on other factors like jobs and housing will assist more people in receiving the appropriate assistance.\n\nAccording to the article, Dr. Chris Udenze, a GP and public health practitioner, does not agree with Dr. Ali's position on ethnicity. Dr. Udenze believes that while other factors like jobs and housing are important, ethnicity is also relevant and should not be dismissed. He believes that structural racism is one of the reasons why disparities exist in the rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths among different ethnic groups.\n\nThe article also mentions that the government has released its first quarterly report on COVID disparities, led by the Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch. The report is a stocktake of the actions taken and the evidence gathered since previous analyses by Public Health England.\n\nThe report found that ethnic groups are at increased risk of COVID-19 infections and deaths, and that the reasons for this are complex and varied.

The Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954 overturned legal segregation in US schools. Despite living just a few streets away from Sumner Elementary School, Linda was turned away and told to enroll in African-American school, two miles away. As a nine-year-old, it meant crossing train tracks and getting a bus alone. Her father, Oliver Brown, became one of 13 plaintiffs to bring a lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education. In a 1985 interview Ms Brown said her father took up the challenge because he \"felt that it was wrong for black people to have to accept second-class citizenship\". In a 1954 Supreme Court ruling, the court unanimously ruled that segregated schools were \"inherently unequal\" and had a \"detrimental effect\" on African-American children.

The prime ministers and presidents haven't yet arrived, but police used water cannon to disperse demonstrators, and there have been scuffles as officers tried to clear small tented camps set up by protestors. Last night, a Porsche garage was torched. On Thursday night, a huge demonstration is planned. On Friday, protesters aim to stop world leaders getting into the summit. At Hamburg's police headquarters, there is an atmosphere of nervous tension. Teams of officers in minibuses drive in and out past lines of water cannon and police vans, parked up and ready for action. About 20,000 officers are on duty over the course of G20. The police, it seems, are taking no chances. They say up to 8,000 extremists, armed with home-made weapons, are targeting the city. \"Some of these militants will be very aggressive,\" said Ralf Martin Meyer, the chief of Hamburg police. \"In the last few days we've seized improvised weapons like slingshots, ball bearings and fire extinguishers filled with flammable liquid which were intended for use against police officers. \"The amount of tools and weapons we found make us very concerned.\" The police operation has divided opinion in Germany.

On Thursday, the girls' families challenged the investigators' report in the district court in Badaun in northern India, demanding further investigations in the case. BBC Hindi's Ankur Jain tries to find answers to the mysterious deaths in the village of Katra Sahadatganj. The village Katra Sahadatganj is a nondescript village of 4,000 people in northern Uttar Pradesh state. It is mostly inhabited by small farmers and landless farm labourers. There are no lavatories at home and women have to go to the open fields before sunrise and after sunset to relieve themselves. On the night of 27 May, the girls left home at around 8pm, saying they were going to the toilet. A search party looked for them for several hours but could not find them. Later that night, the lower-caste cousins, aged about 12 and 14, were found hanging from a tree. Three brothers, belonging to a somewhat higher caste, were accused of gang rape and murder and arrested, but were freed on bail in September after federal investigators said new forensic tests had concluded the girls were not sexually assaulted. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) says the elder girl had \"an intimate relationship\" with the main accused Pappu Yadav and her younger cousin was \"facilitating the relationship\". The girls killed themselves because they were afraid of facing their families after they were discovered by Nazru, a neighbour who is also the main witness in the case, the CBI adds. Few in the village are convinced by the CBI's suicide story - rights groups have called it a partisan investigation and the girls' families have rejected the findings.

Cambridgeshire Police is investigating the case, which is believed to be an \u201cexceptional crime.\u201d A thorough investigation of security measures at the museum is underway, and forensic examinations have been conducted at the scene, while CCTV footage is being examined. Police patrols have also been increased in the area around the museum.\n\nAccording to the article, the items stolen from the museum are of great cultural significance and worth millions of pounds, making them valuable targets for thieves. Police are working closely with museum staff to recover the stolen items and bring those responsible to justice.\n\nDet Ch Supt Karen Daber, who is leading the investigation, is particularly concerned about recovering the stolen items, as they are valuable and of great cultural significance. She is asking for the public\u2019s help in identifying any unusual or suspicious activity in or around the museum between 6pm and 8pm, as this could provide valuable clues to the investigation.\n\nWhile this is a rare type of crime, it is not unprecedented, as similar thefts have occurred in other museums, such as the Oriental Museum at Durham University, where Chinese jade and porcelain items were stolen. However, those items have since been found, and five people have been arrested and questioned about the raid.\n\nAmong the stolen items in Cambridge are six pieces from the Ming dynasty, including a jade 16th Century carved buffalo, a carved horse from the 17th Century, a green and brown jade carved elephant, and a jade cup and vase carved with bronze designs.","115":"The United States has announced that it will freeze its funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) pending the completion of a 90-day review of the organization\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The decision comes in the wake of mounting criticism from the Trump administration that the WHO has been too slow in its response to the outbreak and has been too critical of the U.S. in its handling of the pandemic. The WHO has responded by saying that now is not the time to cut funding and that the organization is doing its best to support the international effort to contain the virus. The U.S. is the largest single funder of the WHO and gave it more than $400 million in 2019. The decision to freeze funding is likely to have a significant impact on the WHO\u2019s ability to continue its work in addressing the coronavirus pandemic. The WHO has been a key organization in the international effort to contain the virus and has been praised for its efforts in raising awareness and providing advice and information to member states. The organization has also been critical in raising funds and coordinating the efforts of member states in combatting the disease. The decision to freeze funding is likely to have a major impact on the WHO\u2019s ability to continue its work in addressing the coronavirus pandemic and may further undermine the organization\u2019s efforts to contain the disease.\n\n### \"Get 15% discount on your first 3 orders with us\" Use the following coupon FIRST15\n\nOrder Now","116":"Paisley Book Festival is one of the first festivals to launch in 2021.

London Underground (LU) rejected this strategy, saying that the strategy is just a discussion paper to stimulate fresh thinking in LU and it does not represent the agreed proposals of change. In this strategy LU predicts that by 2017 only 20% of trains will be manually operated with train drivers in cabs. In addition to this, LU also predicts to close most of ticket offices by 2016 as more people use contact-less bank cards or Oyster smartcards to pay for their journeys. Across London 30 ticket offices will remain which will become \u201ctravel centres\u201d by 2016. The strategy also mentions about a recruitment freeze and \u201cimposing\u201d overtime working.

However, the government has been insistent that the cap is necessary in order to control the budget deficit. The Labour Party has been campaigning to get the cap lifted, arguing that it is unfair to public sector workers. The government has been resistant to this idea, but some Conservatives have been making noises about potentially lifting the cap in order to appease the party\u2019s backbenchers who are angry about the government\u2019s election defeat. The Queen\u2019s Speech, the first of the new Parliament, contained a number of proposals that Labour had opposed, including the continued implementation of the pay cap. The government won the vote on the issue, but Labour\u2019s amendment to the Queen\u2019s Speech, which also called for an end to cuts to the police and emergency services, was defeated by a majority of 14. This showed that the Conservatives still have a majority in the House of Commons, but the defeat on the Queen\u2019s Speech issue demonstrated that the party is still vulnerable on the issue of austerity.\n\nMake sure you also paraphrase the content of the text in your own words\n\nMake sure to cite the text in the bibliography\n\nMake sure the summary is at least 5 sentences in length\n\nMake sure to summarize the key points of the text\n\nMake sure the summary is in your own words\n\nMake sure the summary is in the first person\n\nMake sure to include the bibliographic reference\n\nMake sure to paraphrase the text\n\nMake sure to summarize the text\n\nMake sure to include the bibliographic reference\n\nMake sure to paraphrase the text\n\nMake sure to summarize the text\n\nMake sure to include the bibliographic reference\n\nMake sure to paraphrase the text\n\nMake sure to summarize the text\n\nMake sure to include the bibliographic reference\n\nMake sure to paraphrase the text\n\nMake sure to summarize the text\n\nMake sure to include the bibliographic reference","121":"In the United States of America, on September 11, 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by Al Qaeda militants and crashed into the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

On the 17th anniversary of the attacks, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump observed a moment of silence at the White House and the Pentagon to remember the victims of the attacks. At 09:37 (13:37 GMT), American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon and the president and first lady observed a moment of silence to honor the lives lost. The president then gave a speech at the Pentagon to commemorate the victims of the attacks and those who have served in the military since 9\/11. In his speech, the president acknowledged the millions of young men and women who have joined the military to defend the United States from barbaric forces of evil and destruction. The president also spoke of the savage killers who attacked the United States and said that the United States will never forget the sacrifices of the victims of the attacks and that the United States will never forget the sacrifices of the soldiers who served in the military since 9\/11.

The controversy has raised questions about the SNP\u2019s commitment to the principle of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d and the role of the party in investigating such claims. The political editor of the Scotsman, Brian Taylor, argues that the SNP\u2019s handling of the Alex Salmond case has been damaging to the party, both in the short term and in the medium term.\n\nTaylor argues that the exchanges between SNP members and the media over the past week have been \u201cplaintive\u201d and \u201cwoebegone\u201d in tone, and that this is not surprising given the current situation. In the short term, the controversy is damaging to the SNP because it creates a distraction from the party\u2019s political agenda, and because it could harm the SNP\u2019s reputation as a party that is committed to the principle of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d In the medium term, the controversy could also harm the SNP\u2019s reputation as a party that is committed to the principle of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty,\u201d as it could create the impression that the SNP is willing to sacrifice the rights of the accused in order to protect its own political interests.\n\nTaylor also argues that the SNP\u2019s handling of the Alex Salmond case has been damaging to the party because it has created the impression that the party is unwilling to follow the proper legal procedures in investigating claims of sexual misconduct. The SNP\u2019s decision to appoint its own inquiry to investigate the claims against Alex Salmond has been criticised by some as a violation of the principle of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty,\u201d as the SNP\u2019s inquiry did not have the authority to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. The SNP\u2019s decision to appoint its own inquiry also created the impression that the party was more concerned about protecting its political interests than in ensuring that the proper legal procedures were followed in investigating claims of sexual misconduct.\n\nTaylor also argues that the SNP\u2019s handling of the Alex Salmond case has been damaging to the party because it has created the impression that the party is unwilling to take responsibility for its actions.

The High Court in London has rejected a legal challenge to the decision to suspend Parliament, but the decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. The Scottish court is considering an appeal against a ruling by Lord Doherty that the issue is for politicians and voters to decide, and not the courts. The court is also hearing from lawyers representing about 70 parliamentarians who are challenging the government's decision to suspend Parliament. The lawyers argue that the suspension is unlawful, as it is an attack on democracy and the balance of the constitution. However, the government QC argues that prorogation is not a matter for the legal system, as it is a political decision that is not apt for judicial control. The court has yet to make a decision on the appeal, and the suspension of Parliament is expected to begin on Monday.\n\n#### Top Answer\n\nJudges...

Patients will be able to check their symptoms through the mobile app and then have video consultations within two hours of booking. The Royal College of GPs has warned the service may not help patients with complex needs. The new free service has been launched by a group of London GPs and the online healthcare provider Babylon. Virtual consultation Dr Mobasher Butt, who is part of the team behind the GP at Hand service, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's high time that NHS patients were given the opportunity to benefit from technology to improve access to healthcare. \"We've benefited from this kind of technology in so many different aspects of our lives, whether that be shopping or banking, and it's really time that we were able to do that in healthcare for NHS patients.\" Jane Barnacle, director of patients and information at NHS England London, said GP practices were right to carefully test innovative new technologies that could improve free NHS services for their patients while also freeing up staff time. But the Royal College of GPs is concerned the new service might only work for younger healthier commuters and not those with complex health conditions. Concerns Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the RCPG, said: \"We are really worried that schemes like this are creating a twin-track approach to NHS general practice and that patients are being 'cherry-picked', which could actually increase the pressures on traditional GPs based in the community. \"We understand that with increasingly long waiting times to see a GP, an online service is convenient and appealing, but older patients and those living with more complex needs want continuity of care and the security of their local practice where their GPs know them. \"We notice there is an extensive list of patient reviews on the service, many of whom praise the service. The service has been awarded the highest accreditation, but critics have also raised concerns that the service might only work for younger healthier commuters and not those with complex health conditions.","138":"In a recent report, Moody\u2019s, a major credit agency, has given China\u2019s economy an Aa3 rating. The agency also noted that China\u2019s economic performance has been very high compared to other countries in recent years. However, China\u2019s economy is currently undergoing a transformation from an export-led to a more service and consumption-based economy. This has resulted in lower GDP growth rates, and lower fiscal strength. Moody\u2019s also noted that China\u2019s high debt burden is making it difficult for the country to implement economic reforms. Furthermore, the agency noted that China\u2019s GDP growth is likely to slow further as the high debt burden dampens business investment and unfavorable demographic trends continue to worsen.

About 150 people attended a spiritual dedication ceremony on Wednesday night. In July Mr Parsley was told he needed retrospective permission, but the council said he had still not applied. Moonhenge, also called Woodhenge, was conceived as a tribute to Mr Parsley\u2019s wife, who died in August 2012. Mr Massey said: \"The 19 outer trees represent a moon henge - a lunar cycle. \"The inner circle of 10 trees will be a celebration or theatre area, which will have hanging curtains decorated in ancient Neolithic patterns.\" The dedication ceremony will include \"an evening of ancient ritual, blessing, dancing, drumming and sacred revelry\" beneath the full moon. A spokesman for Huntingdonshire District Council, who informed Mr Parsley on July 26, that the structure required planning permission, said: \"It is not unlawful to erect a structure without planning permission or have a party at such a structure. \"It only becomes unlawful if an enforcement notice is issued and it is not complied with.

The latest effort to combat the waiting list will see 1,000 extra tests per day added in September. Plans are also in place to minimise the disruption caused by industrial action planned for Friday. In June, the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) announced it would open some test centres on Sundays in a bid to tackle the backlog. Some drivers have been unable to secure an appointment until after their MOTs have expired, with some having to wait up to six weeks for a slot. Thirty new vehicle examiners have been hired and reminder letters are being sent out earlier to deal with the waits. The Department for Infrastructure told BBC News NI it was planning to add thousands of extra test slots. \"A further 9,000 appointments on Sundays and bank holidays in August will be made available, along with 1,000 additional tests per day from September\", a spokesperson said. However, we continue to have a significant number of customers failing to attend for their MOT test and we therefore encourage customers to either attend their pre-booked appointments or cancel them to allow others to make use of the appointment.\" In June, 2,300 motorists failed to turn up for their tests. That accounted for about 3% of all scheduled tests. A DVA spokesperson said that in the 2018\/19 financial year, 32,000 customers did not attend their MOT appointments. The Federation of Small Businesses said it is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the impact the backlog is having on its members.

Additionally, he wants to give police officers the power to conduct roadside stops without reasonable suspicion, as well as in some circumstances to remove drivers' rights to choose between a blood or urine sample and a breath test. According to the minister, while much progress has been made in eradicating a drink-drive culture, more work must be done to achieve that goal. Over the past five years, 75 people have been killed and 463 injured in Northern Ireland as a result of alcohol or drug impairment by drivers, which is considered to be unacceptable by the minister. He said he is determined to do whatever he can to tackle the issue once and for all, and to make a real difference. Zero tolerance measures like those proposed by the minister in Northern Ireland do not currently exist in other parts of the United Kingdom, but recent talks about lowering the legal alcohol limit in the Republic of Ireland do exist. In several European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain, the legal alcohol limit is 50 milligrams per 100 milliliters or lower. Some countries have variations, such as in Spain, where newly qualified drivers have a lower limit. Julie Townsend, from the road safety charity Brake, supports the minister's position and hopes the rest of the United Kingdom will follow suit. Brake also wants to see a zero tolerance approach to drunk driving, and believes that a legal alcohol limit of 20 milligrams per 100 milliliters across the UK would send a clear message to drivers that none of them should be drunk while driving.","149":"The NHS is a very expensive service to the British taxpayer.

Scientists reporting in Nature describe an astronomical study of extraordinary resolution to tackle the mystery. They found dust grains of nearly a millionth of a metre across, big enough to be pushed out by dying stars' light. The team of astronomers from Australian and European universities took a look at three so-called red giant stars - stars that were once like our Sun is now, but that have exhausted their supply of hydrogen and grown to gargantuan proportions. In a process that is an extreme case of the kind of solar wind that our Sun experiences, such stars blow much of their mass away in the form of gas and grains of mineral material on their way to becoming white dwarfs. Lead author of the study Barnaby Norris, of the University of Sydney, told BBC News that the stars were \"the galaxy's great recyclers\" - the material that they spit out \"goes on to make the next generation of stars and planets\". Polarising discussion What has confused astronomers until now is just how that material is expelled; computer models of the process suggest that particles coming from the stars should be so small that they would simply absorb the light around them and undergo significant heating. To get a look at the dust surrounding the three red giants, Mr Norris and his colleagues used the Very Large Telescope in Chile, applying a technique called polarimetric interferometry. The light from the three stars, like that from our Sun, is unpolarised - the light waves undulate in random directions. But light that strikes the dust surrounding them is preferentially bounced toward us, undulating along a particular direction - just as sunlight reflected off a body of water is polarised along a direction parallel to the water's surface. The team refined a method of blocking some of the VLT's light and combining images of the stars in different polarisations, allowing them to create an extremely high-resolution map of the dust surrounding the stars. From these maps, they could see that the dust is polarised along a direction perpendicular to the direction of the light from the stars. This means the grains must be big enough, about a millionth of a millimetre in size, to reflect light without being heated by it, and thus big enough to be pushed out","152":"This article focuses on the issue of closing of the Forensic Science Service in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, resulting in job losses of 130 people.

Rubbish on UK coasts rose by 6.4% from 2013 to 2014, it said in a report. Beaches in Wales had the highest litter levels, followed by those in England, while rubbish on coastlines in Scotland and Northern Ireland fell, it said. Wipes do not easily disintegrate and sewerage systems are not able to process them. They can block sewers, and when they are washed into the sea they can end up on beaches. The report - published as part of the MCS's annual Great British Beach Clean - was based on litter found by more than 5,000 volunteers on 301 UK beaches, from 19 to 22 September last year. Sewer blockages Volunteers collected 2,501 bags of rubbish from coastlines, including 273,747 items of litter. They collected 2,457 pieces of rubbish per kilometre - up from 2,309 bits per kilometre in 2013. Discarded items found included a colostomy bag, a plastic hand, a piping gun nozzle, a bra strap and - on one beach alone - nine pairs of shoes. The survey found: An average of 35 wet wipes were found for every kilometre of beach cleaned in 2014, up from 23 per kilometre the previous year.

The Conservatives had wanted to change strike rules during the coalition, but had been blocked by the Lib Dems, he said. \"What people are fed up of is strike action that hasn't been properly supported by the members of the relevant union. \"We've seen, including in the last five years, strike action that took place where perhaps only 10% to 15% of the members of that profession actually voted for it, and that's not right, it's unfair, especially when it comes to essential public services. \"Think of the impact it has - transport, health services - on ordinary people, going about their daily jobs - they should be in people's minds.\" He said the alterations to th\n\nSummarization generated by AI\n\nThe government plans to make legal strikes close to impossible by requiring 40% of eligible union members to support a strike and a 50% turnout in the ballot.

Hotelier John Evans said no prior notice was given that road marking would be taking place and labelled the attempt a \"complete farce\". But Ceredigion council insisted it had put up notices which had been \"disregarded\" by motorists. Mr Evans owns Yr Hafod Guest House on the corner of Marine Terrace and South Road. He said the council had given residents no prior notice the lines would be painted and no cones had been left out. \"The first thing we knew was white lines appeared on the road,\" he said. \"Now we know that's where the council wanted the lines to go, but we weren't told it would happen.\"\n\nAccording to a council spokeswoman, the council is in the process of marking roads at more than 200 locations across Ceredigion. \"Due to vehicles disregarding notices not to park, this work has been compromised,\" she said. \"These short sections of yellow lines were painted in order to discourage further parking at the location so that the works could be recommenced and completed as soon as possible.\" However, Ceredigion council insisted it had put up notices which had been \"disregarded\" by motorists.","160":"The execution of North Korean defense minister Kim Hyon and other officials by mortar fire was the most brutal execution in the country's history and was considered an act of total control by the North Korean regime.\n\nThe execution of Kim Hyon and other officials by mortar fire in North Korea has been considered the most brutal execution in the country's history, with the aim of obliterating the person and any opposition, and achieving total control.\n\nThe idea behind this execution is to render the person a non-person, and to bury the corpse in an undisclosed location, so that the family has no body to bury and the person is not remembered.\n\nNorth Korea is not alone in its brutal execution of prisoners, as other countries have also resorted to such measures in the past. The execution of prisoners by throwing them out of planes into the ocean in Argentina during the last military government, from 1976 to 1983, is known as \"death flights.\" In other countries, including Sudan, Saudi Arabia, and Uganda, the corpse of executed prisoners has been subjected to humiliating treatment, such as being crucified or fed to crocodiles.\n\nIn addition to the brutal execution of prisoners, North Korea has also resorted to other measures to control its citizens, such as mass show trials of prisoners in Xinjiang in China, in which the prisoners are paraded in trucks in sports stadiums and physically restrained to force them to bow, reinforcing the idea that the collective is more important than the individual and that controlling thoughts is more important than controlling behavior.\n\nOverall, North Korea's brutal execution of its defense minister and other officials is a reminder of the extreme measures that authoritarian regimes are willing to take to maintain control and suppress dissent, and the importance of respecting human rights and the rule of law in order to prevent such atrocities from happening in the future.\n\n##### Do you need a similar assignment done for you from scratch?

The government has announced it will review its benefits system for the terminally ill following a damning parliamentary report. Emma welcomed the news and told the BBC: \"Financial worries should not be added to a families' difficulties at such a distressing time.\" Call for sensitivity Currently, when a person's death is expected within six months they qualify for fast-tracked access to benefits. But this six-month rule - which was introduced into law 30 years ago - was dubbed \"outdated, arbitrary and not based on clinical reality\" by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Terminal Illness. Emma, who is from Somerset, said: \"The higher rate attendance allowance took a few weeks to be assessed. All the while my father was deteriorating. The extra allowance helped my mother pay for additional support at home. \"My father was cared for in his own home, rather than in hospital, which saved the NHS thousands of pounds. The attendance allowance helped support our family to do this. \"My dad didn't know how long he had. The rest of the family did, but if someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness you don't want to necessarily put a timescale on this and suggest the clock is ticking.\" She called for the system to become more sensitive to the circumstances of the individuals with whom it was dealing.

Whilst others, such as Boris Johnson and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, have dominated the headlines, the Treasury has played it differently.\n\nThe first argument the Treasury has focused on is that the economic and trading links between Britain and the rest of the EU are so deep and intractable that a sharp and irrevocable split would carry perilous risk. From that argument came agreement to a \"transition period\" following the UK's official departure from the EU next March. The second argument the Treasury has focused on is that open economies such as Britain depend on goods being traded freely across borders and that the way to achieve this with the UK's biggest customer, the EU, was via some form of customs deal. From that argument came the 'facilitated customs arrangement' the Cabinet is discussing at Chequers today.\n\nIn its arguments for the softest of soft Brexits, the Treasury has had some allies. The first is not a person, but a thing - the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Only via close alignment with the EU can there be any hope that the border can be kept free of customs checkpoints.\n\nFurthermore, the second ally is the fear of economic damage. Even though the Chancellor's forecasts in the spring Budget in November that the economy will grow by about 1.5 per cent over the next couple of years still look reasonable, the Office for Budget Responsibility has also forecast that the economy will grow by about 1.5 per cent over the next couple of years, and the Office of Budget Responsibility has forecast that the economy will grow by about 1.5 per cent over the next couple of years.\n\nIn conclusion, the Treasury has been the most influential department in the government in shaping the Brexit negotiations, and the Chancellor and the Treasury have pushed for the closest possible relationship with the European Union in order to reduce the potential of lasting economic damage to Britain post-Brexit.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com August 25","174":"The following is the summary of the article:\nMamoudou Gassama won wide praise after saving a four-year-old boy by climbing the outside of the building.

The party is in the middle of a seven-hour meeting of top officials to decide on the future of its leadership, following a letter from dissident members asking for sweeping reforms to the party. The dissidents criticized the party's leadership, which has long been seen as the Gandhi family's domain. This has been the beginning of a massive decline in the party's popularity in India, as it has been ousted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP in the last election in 2019. The party lost more than half of its parliamentary seats and is now in power in just six Indian states, four of which are members of a coalition. Analysts and political commentators attribute the party's demise to its inability to look beyond the Gandhi family and its inadequate leadership. Congress has seen its fortunes decline since its inception and the recent letter from dissident members has exposed a long-standing battle between older and younger members of the party. The dissident members' letter has also raised concerns about the party's internal policies and its inability to address the needs of its members. This has led to the party's downfall and has made it vulnerable to external pressures. The party's inability to look beyond the Gandhi family and its inadequate leadership has been the root cause of its demise.","181":"The Times newspaper reported that Maria Miller, who is leading the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, said that marriage as an institution has always been evolving and will continue to do so.

However, supporters of the plan said that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is a good move as it gives couples who love each other the opportunity to get married.\n\nBBC\n\nThe Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill has been passed in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom by a majority of 400 votes to 175. The bill, which will make same-sex marriage legal in England and Wales, is now set to become law following the passing of the bill in the House of Commons on 5 February 2013.\n\nThe Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is the first of its kind in the United Kingdom and is seen as a major step forward in the fight for equality for same-sex couples. The bill was introduced by the government in November 2012 and has been through several stages in the House of Commons and the House of Lords.\n\nThe Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is seen as a major step forward in the fight for equality for same-sex couples, as it will give same-sex couples the same legal rights as married heterosexual couples.

The project was commissioned by the Ferens Art Gallery and was the largest of its kind ever to be staged in the UK. Thousands of volunteers gathered just before dawn to be daubed with four shades of blue body paint which represented water. They posed at a number of locations across the city, including Queen's Gardens, the Guildhall and the Scale Lane swing bridge, for a photo shoot that lasted about four hours. Some of the participants included 80-year-old Stephane Janssen, from Brussels, who has posed for Tunick on 20 previous occasions, and Sarah Hossack, from Hull, who said it was \"absolutely fantastic\" to be part of the artwork. The local authority said the installation had attracted \"the largest number of participants\" in any of Tunick's previous UK artworks, beating Gateshead in 2005 and Salford in 2010. Tunick said: \"The Sea of Hull installation was one of the most fantastic projects I've ever done, and it was inspiring to be able to intertwine the city's maritime heritage against an urban backdrop throughout the whole piece.\" Kirsten Simister, curator of art at Ferens Art Gallery, said she was \"overwhelmed\" by the number of people who took part in the project.","187":"The article highlights the importance of an early Bronze Age disc, which is believed to represent the sun, and its significance in the history of Wiltshire Museum. The disc was discovered by Guy Underwood during an excavation of a burial mound at Monkton Farleigh and was \"kept safe\" for nearly 70 years by landowner - Dr Denis Whitehead. It is made of metal and is thought to have been sewn to a piece of clothing or head-dress. The article also mentions that the disc is one of only six ever found and one of the earliest metal objects discovered in the UK, making it an important piece of history. The Wiltshire Museum is \"delighted\" to be able to display \"this incredibly rare sun-disc\" and is \"kept safe\" for nearly 70 years by landowner - Dr Denis Whitehead.","188":"The article summarized the key points of the blog post by consultant Richard Cree, who works in the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, England. According to Cree, the number of patients being admitted to his hospital has risen significantly, and the situation is only going to get worse due to the new coronavirus variant. In preparation for the surge in patients, all elective surgery at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton has been cancelled for the next eight weeks, and staff numbers have been \"bolstered\" by retired and paediatric nurses. Cree urges everyone to play their part in following the lockdown measures in order to make it effective. He has seen too many people die from the virus, and asks the public to please stay at home to prevent further loss of lives.","189":"In the past, mental health services in Scotland have been under-developed, and the number of young people seeking help has been increasing. The Scottish government has promised to improve access to services, and has also set up a new strategy to help improve the mental health of young people. The Scottish Youth Parliament has also been supporting the push for improved services, and has been working with the Scottish Children's Services Coalition to improve access to services. The Scottish government has said that some local authorities are not meeting the government's targets for improving the number of young people who are seen by Cahms and psychologists.

The application process was especially competitive this year, with more than 17,200 applicants vying for only 3,200 places. State school pupils who do gain admittance to Oxford University tend to be more qualified than their private school peers, but the university points out that only about 7% of pupils in England and Wales attend private schools, compared to 46% of Oxford undergraduates. Getting into Oxford is not as difficult as some people might think, says Mike Nicholson, head of undergraduate admissions at the university. In fact, on average, there are about five applicants for every place, meaning only about 20% of applicants will gain admission. The university is looking for students who are intelligent, interested in their subject, and who can demonstrate their interest in that subject through their application. One of the most important things for applicants to Oxford is to demonstrate confidence in their own opinions, even when others might disagree. Barton Peveril College, a state school, has been particularly successful in getting its students into Oxford, and head of history Mark Robinson attributes this to the school's emphasis on giving pupils confidence in their own opinions, even when challenged by others. Oxford professor Thomas Noe also believes that pupils who stick up for themselves and argue their points stand out from the crowd.","191":"The BBC has recently reported that four UK councils have been granted additional government funding to cover their day-to-day costs. The four councils, Eastbourne, Bexley, Luton, and Peterborough, will receive greater flexibility to borrow money from the government. This comes as some local authorities are warning of financial ruin amidst the strain of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to BBC analysis in 2020, nearly 150 councils forecasted a combined budget shortfall of at least \u00a33.2bn. This crisis is due to the unprecedented strain on councils\u2019 finances caused by the pandemic. Councils\u2019 core spending power is due to rise by up to \u00a32.3bn next year, but some councils are still warning of shortfalls.\n\nThe government had previously provided almost \u00a35bn in emergency support since the start of the pandemic to help councils deal with spiralling costs. However, the latest news of the additional funding for the four councils has been met with mixed responses from the public. Some argue that the government should be providing more support to other councils in need, while others question the level of support given to the four councils in question.\n\nThe government\u2019s decision to grant additional funding to the four councils has been criticised by some as being too little too late. Some councils have been warning that they may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support. This is due to the unprecedented strain on council finances caused by the pandemic, which has resulted in a loss of income from services such as parking, leisure centres, and other facilities.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s investigation into the financial crisis faced by councils in the UK found that some of the largest UK councils have been warning that they may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support. The government has said that the latest decision to grant additional funding to the four councils is on an \u2018exceptional basis\u2019 and that the councils will be subject to \u2018rigorous reviews\u2019 of their finances.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s investigation also found that some councils have been forced to make drastic cuts to services in order to make ends meet. This has resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs and the closure of vital services such as libraries, leisure","192":"At the start of this article, we are told about Corrie Mckeague\u2019s, and his family\u2019s, struggles over his mysterious disappearance in September of last year. The first paragraph tells us that Corrie disappeared after a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 24 September. His mother Nicola Urquhart said he had a Fab Swingers account, and Suffolk Police spokesman said: \"We are aware of the social media and websites Corrie was using. This is part of our investigation.\" In other words, they want to know what his activities on Fab Swingers were, in order to make more sense of his disappearance. The next paragraph tells us more about Corrie\u2019s own activities on the Fab Swingers website. His girlfriend April Oliver is pregnant with his baby, and Corrie\u2019s Fab Swingers account is not a secret: his family has been aware of it \u201clong before\u201d Corrie went missing, and has been able to give police usernames to help start looking into his activities on Fab Swingers. Mrs Urquhart also said her son was not suffering from depression or mental health issues, and is now looking forward to the second public search for Corrie, which will take place on January 22.","193":"The Church of Caracas faces shortages of supplies to make consecrated bread.

This comes after a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) indicated that the Asian countries were likely to suffer most from the trade dispute between the two countries. The Unctad report indicated that the tariffs imposed by the United States on China would result in the loss of about $160 billion in exports in the region. The Unctad also warned that the implications of the trade dispute between the United States and China could be felt in countries that are not directly involved in the dispute. The United States has imposed tariffs on a range of Chinese imports, including industrial machinery, electronics, and computer equipment. The tariffs have been in place since July 2018, when the United States imposed a 25 percent tariff on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. In retaliation, China imposed tariffs on a range of American products, including soybeans, pork, and aluminum. The United States also imposed tariffs on a range of other Chinese imports, including autos and electronics, in December 2018. The United States has also imposed tariffs on a range of other countries, including Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. The United States has said that it is willing to negotiate with China in order to resolve the trade dispute.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that all secondary pupils would have time in school from Monday. She said that even a small amount of time in class would benefit them. EIS assistant secretary Andrea Bradley told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show that the workload on teachers was \"already off the scale\". She said: \"The decision seemed to be a political one rather than one that was based on sound educational principle. \"Certainly it wasn't one that has taken account of the very real circumstances in which teachers are working - under quite significant stress and pressure over the last six months.\" S1-S3 pupils are the final group to return to school part-time after lockdown. Primaries one to three returned full time on 22 February, along with older pupils in S4 to S6 who had to complete work for qualifications. Primaries four to seven make a full-time return from Monday. Because schools currently have to stick to 2m distancing, capacity is greatly reduced for the rest of the pupils. Ms Bradley added: \"The government have been keen to get all young people back to school, there has been strong lobbying for that from some quarters. \"Teachers really are struggling with the workload surrounding all of this. She added: \"We have to have cognisance of the context in which the decision was announced, it took place before the parliamentary evidence giving session. \"Our sense was the government were looking for a good news story that week.\" The Scottish government previously said that pupils in S1 to S3 would not return to school until April, but in an announcement on 2 March Nicola Sturgeon brought the date forward.

He was speaking as ministers prepare to meet at the prime minister's country residence to agree a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. Airbus is taking steps to mitigate the impact of Brexit, Mr Enders said. \"Brexit in any form, soft or hard, light or clean - whatever you call it - will be damaging,\" he added. A government spokesperson said it was confident of reaching a good Brexit deal, adding: \"We do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.\" Mr Enders' comments follow a warning given last month that Airbus could leave the UK if the country leaves the single market and customs union without a transition deal. At the time, the company said: \"This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country.\" Airbus makes wings for the A320, A330\/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK and has 14,000 staff. It said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. Mr Enders said he had a duty to Airbus shareholders to speak up: \"We have been very clear about what the consequences particularly of a hard Brexit would be.\" His comments are the latest warning on Brexit by big business. On Thursday, Jaguar Land Rover - the UK's biggest carmaker - said a \"bad\" Brexit deal could force it to close factories and would threaten \u00a380bn of investment plans for the UK.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com December 20, 2018, 3:29 pm ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/business\/corporate-culture\/brexit-discussion-27320\n\nRead the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.\n\n$2.19","198":"\u00b7 The alien invader has so far been found at Cardiff Bay and Eglwys Nunydd reservoir in Port Talbot.\n\u00b7 Biologists say it can have a devastating impact on native species and could even lead to extinctions.\n\u00b7 The nets will be deployed at other \"high priority sites\" across Wales.\n\u00b7 The Dikerogammarus villosus, originally from the region around the Black and Caspian seas, has spread across western Europe over the past 10 years via waterways such as the Danube and Rhine Canal.\n\u00b7 Measuring up to 30mm in length, it thrives on hard surfaces like boulders, rocks and gravel just below the water surface so such areas are being treated as priority for sampling in Wales.\n\u00b7 It has earned its nickname because it sometimes kills its prey and leaves it uneaten.\n\u00b7 The Welsh Assembly Government and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have established a national task group to tackle the shrimp.\n\u00b7 It includes Environment Agency Wales and the Countryside Council for Wales.\n\u00b7 Native invertebrates Andrew Johnson of the Environment Agency said: \"We know from research done in other parts of the world that the spread of the this fish can have a devastating effect on the ecology.\n\u00b7 We do not want to replicate this impact which is why the work we are doing with these traps is so important.\"\n\u00b7 He said the shrimp could damage fisheries in Wales and if it were to spread lead to the demise of other native invertebrates such as mayflies.\n\u00b7 As well as testing other sites in Wales, the task group is working on ways to contain the shrimp from spreading and investigating methods of dealing with it.\n\u00b7 New research has been commissioned as it admits the \"available knowledge is limited.\"\n\u00b7 It is also urging anyone who uses waters where the shrimp are present - including boat owners and anglers - to take steps to prevent the species from \n\n### Don\u2019t wait!

The HS2 network is due to be built in stages, with the final leg to Leeds completed by 2040. But critics say its \u00a3106bn price tag cannot be justified. In December, the National Infrastructure Commission said that the government should focus on improving rail links between cities in the North and Midlands over new projects such as HS2. As a result, transport groups in the North and Midlands had feared the eastern leg of the project could be scrapped. However, speaking at an online event run by the Policy Exchange think tank this week Mr Shapps said HS2 would be built in full and might be delivered earlier than previously planned. \"We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,\" he said. \"The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which have developed a very long way since HS2 was first dreamt up all those decades ago. That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail.\" Mr Shapps suggested the eastern leg to Leeds originally scheduled for completion between 2035 and 2040 could be brought forward \"quite dramatically\" by building it \"in a smarter way\". He said the government would provide further information on that \"soon\". Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a lobby group, said the government was doing the right thing. \"It's critical to ensuring levelling up is a reality not just rhetoric,\" said Mr Murison, referring to election promises to boost the economy in the north of England.

But its future direction is of geopolitical importance. Why does Ukraine matter to US? For much of its 28-year independent history it has been unclear whether Ukraine would end up aligned with Russia or the West. In 2014, that uncertainty appeared to come to an end. After a bloody street revolution, Ukraine\u2019s new leaders asserted that the country\u2019s future lay with closer association with Europe and the West. Russia was now seen as the enemy and it responded by seizing Crimea and supporting an armed uprising in eastern Ukraine that has so far cost more than 13,000 lives. Under the US Obama administration, Ukrainians\u2019 right to decide their own future, and to resist Russian aggression, was defended as an important ideological principle. That changed when President Trump took office, and Ukraine\u2019s government has not been able to rely on America\u2019s active support in the same way since. How much military aid does the US give? The US has a longstanding relationship with the Ukrainian military and has committed about $1.5bn (","202":"Paragraph 1: Rebekka Hudd has been tending her daughter's garden for 20 years, and the parish council has told her that she is no longer needed.\nParagraph 2: Rebekka was killed near her South Gloucestershire home when a car mounted the pavement and hit her.

Here's a look at 13 of the most eye-catching outfits. 1. Billie Eilish is going to find it difficult to text with these nails The singer wore a gorgeous white Chanel jacket on the red carpet, complete with several Chanel accessories. Her hair was fixed with the \"CC\" logo hairclip and tied in a Chanel headband, while her lacy fingerless gloves were labelled with \"Cha\" and \"Nel\". Her extra-long black nails completed the look, which was easily one of the highlights of this year's red carpet. Eilish went on to perform at the ceremony. The rumours that she would debut her new Bond theme sadly came to nothing, but she did perform a haunting rendition of Yesterday by The Beatles, to accompany the In Memoriam section. 2. Natalie Portman staged a quiet protest You might not have heard about this because hardly anybody has mentioned it in the past month, but no women were nominated for best director at the Oscars this year. So Natalie Portman decided to take matters into her own hands. The actress wore a black Dior gown embroidered with the surnames of the women who would have been eligible in the category, having directed major feature films in the past year. The names included: Lorene Scafaria (who directed Hustlers), Lulu Wang (The Farewell), Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) and Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim). However, she was criticised by fellow actress Rose McGowan for not \"walking the walk\" on the issue. Portman's production company has not yet made a film with a female director other than Portman herself. 3. Julia Butters smuggled in some emergency food There is perhaps nobody more deserving of praise this year than the 10-year-old actress who concealed a sandwich in her $2,500 purse. Julia Butters, who appears in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, was asked by fellow guest Will Ferrell: \"What did you smuggle","206":"The Spanish government and the protesters are in conflict about whether or not to hold a referendum on the region\u2019s independence from Spain.

The event, which is a celebration of the city's Afro-Caribbean culture, has been postponed until September, and organisers have now announced that it will not go ahead this year. Festival organiser Cleo Lake said \"unforeseen challenges and setbacks\" had led to the decision, and denied that the cancellation was because of a lack of funds. She said the event had \"grown significantly\" and was \"getting more and more expensive every year\" to stage.

The units are meant to be \"Covid-secure, safe, habitable, and fit for purpose.\" However, some members of the local community and religious leaders from various faiths, including Christian, Sikh, Muslim, Hindu, and Baha'i, object to the location and the type of accommodation. They argue that the proximity to the nearby detention centre, the difficulties faced by many of the intended residents, and the distance from urban centres make the location unsuitable. The Home Office says the accommodation will be in line with existing standards and contractual requirements, and that the safety and security of asylum seekers, staff, and visitors will be of paramount importance. The government has cited the need to house more asylum seekers as the reason for the new facilities, as the number of asylum seekers in the country has increased to 61,327 in December 2020, compared to 47,000 a year earlier. The opposition to the new facilities has raised concerns about the well-being of asylum seekers, who are already facing difficulties and trauma, and the suitability of the accommodation for their needs. The government has said that the safety and well-being of asylum seekers will be a top priority in the construction and operation of the facilities. The situation highlights the ongoing debates about the treatment of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom, and the need for effective and humane policies to address the issue of refugees and asylum seekers in the country.\n\nLast Updated on January 27, 2023 by Essay Pro","209":"A family lost their home at Eastchurch in a landslide last year. Edd Cane, whose house is 15ft (4.5m) from the edge, said residents there felt abandoned. He said Swale council had threatened to put a demolition order on his home and make him pay for the work. The council said it was advising residents. Mr Cane, 66, said the home he has lived in for 15 years was once 82ft (25m) from the edge of the cliff. But he says the recent cliff falls, which followed weeks of heavy rain, were \"eating away\" at his garden. Mr Cane said: \"I have already been told by the council representative that if [the cliff] gets much closer to my house they will put a demolition order on it and I will be expected to pay to have my house demolished. \"If that's not rubbing salt in the wound, I don't know what is.\" Swale Borough Council and the Environment Agency had agreed on a policy of \"no active intervention\" on coastal defences. Council engineers found it would cost more than \u00a325m to protect the 124 homes and 1,000 caravans on a four-mile stretch on the north of the island.

In an interim report, the committee said: \"The organization set up to create, maintain and operate the blacklist - The Consulting Association (TCA) - appears to have been largely established by Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, which also provided TCA's chairmen for eight of its 16 years of operation. \"Other major subscribers included Skanska and Balfour Beatty.\" Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, whose director Cullum McAlpine appeared before the committee, responded to the report by denying it had ever operated a blacklist. 'Morally indefensible' The MPs said that while the blacklist was not initially illegal, it was always \"morally indefensible\", and the companies involved continued to use it after it had become illegal. The MPs found companies set up a structure through TCA which allowed them to submit names and information on workers they deemed to be unsuitable to a central list and to check prospective employees against that list. \"The emphasis throughout was on secrecy, with telephone access to sensitive information restricted to only a few, with the lists of names submitted destroyed at the end of each working day and no acknowledgement that such a system existed,\" the MPs said.

However, there are signs of hope that measures to create habitat for hedgehogs in urban areas may be paying off.\n\nAccording to the State of Britain's Hedgehogs 2018 report, the number of hedgehogs killed on roads has fallen by between a third and a half across Great Britain, suggesting a decline in rural populations.\n\nHedgehog Officer Emily Wilson expressed concern over the loss of hedges and copses to create larger fields, which has resulted in fewer nesting sites and less protection for hedgehogs.\n\nFarming communities are urged to help halt declines by implementing measures such as creating more habitats for hedgehogs, reducing pesticide use, and minimizing disturbance to nests and hibernating hedgehogs.\n\nDespite the declining numbers, there is still hope for the survival of hedgehogs, as measures to protect and preserve their habitats are being implemented.\n\n### \"Order a similar paper and get 15% discount on your first order with us Use the following coupon \"FIRST15\"\n\nOrder Now","224":"The hearing of Christine Blasey Ford in the Senate Judiciary Committee is a historic event that has been highly anticipated by the public.

She said that she was 100% certain that Brett Kavanaugh, who was referred to as \u201cBrett\u201d in the hearing, was the teenager who assaulted her. Dr Ford also recalled the image of Mr Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, laughing as they stumbled down the stairs after the alleged attack. Dr Ford\u2019s images, and her name, will linger in history and be remembered as a talisman for the troubled time. The cross-examination of Dr Ford by the surrogate questioner, Rachel Mitchell, was disjointed and did not have much flow, as the hearing was interrupted by the swapping of Ms Mitchell\u2019s questions with those of the Democratic senators. Dr Ford answered the questions of the surrogate questioner in a calm and confident manner, and the surrogate questioner did not ask questions about Dr Ford\u2019s qualifications or the validity of the incident. Dr Ford\u2019s testimony was emotional and honest, and the surrogate questioner did not make the hearing any more contentious than it already was. Dr Ford\u2019s testimony is a historic moment that will be remembered in the history of the United States.","225":"I am summarizing this article to get some important points about the man and his attitude towards the man who has been diagnosed with HIV.

His company, Higia Technologies, has raised enough money to start tests and, this week, won the top prize at the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards. His invention, the Eva bra, is only at the prototype stage, but it has been shown to be accurate. The bra is made of biosensors that measure temperature and log it in an app, alerting users to any changes. Women who use the bra must wear it for 60-90 minutes a week to get accurate measurements. In interviews last year, Julian said that having the sensors inside the bra will ensure that the breasts are in the same position each time measurements are taken. Will a cancer-detecting bra actually work? This is in the really early stages and has not been fully tested, and there would need to be medical trials before cancer experts started recommending it as a way to find cancer. Anna Perman from Cancer Research UK told the BBC: \"We know that tumours often have an abnormal system of blood vessels, but we also know that increased blood flow is not necessarily a reliable indicator of cancer.\" \"At present, there is no evidence to show whether this bra is a reliable way to detect tumours, and it is not a good idea for women to use technology that has not been tested in good-quality scientific trials.\" \"It's great to see young people like Julian getting into science and having ideas that could help with cancer diagnosis.\" \"But an important part of science is rigorous testing, to make sure innovations like this actually benefit patients.\" What is the advice for detecting breast cancer now?

She left the plantation, in Dorchester County, Maryland, in September and travelled by night. Her exact route is unknown, but she probably walked along the Choptank river and journeyed through Delaware, guided by the North Star. Years later, she recalled the moment she entered Pennsylvania, where slavery was illegal: \"When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.\" In the years that followed, Tubman returned again and again to Maryland to rescue others, conducting them along the so-called \"underground railroad\", a network of safe houses used to spirit slaves from the South to the free states in the North. Later, she became a Union spy during the Civil War, a prominent supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and a famous veteran of the struggle for the abolition of slavery. But in September 1849, aged 27, Tubman was an unknown slave, uncertain about her future in the wake of her master's death. Fearful of being sold further south, she gathered her two younger brothers, Benjamin and Henry, and on the night of the 17th they escaped. With the help of their father, who had been granted his freedom, the three fugitives hid for three weeks. A notice published in a local newspaper offered a $100 reward for the return of each of them. Scared of what lay ahead, Ben and Henry had a change of heart and returned. Tubman, with a steely determination that would come to define her, pushed on alone. A daring escape Harriet Tubman was the fourth of nine children born to two enslaved parents in Dorchester County, Maryland.

The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in favour of same-sex marriage in the United States was the catalyst for the decision to grant benefits to married same-sex couples in the military. The benefits include healthcare and housing and will be open to any military member with a valid marriage certificate. The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The Pentagon had already extended certain privileges to same-sex couples after a ban on openly gay troops - known as Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell - was repealed in September 2011. The Pentagon also stated that it would grant leave for military personnel stationed in a state that does not permit same-sex marriage to travel to a jurisdiction where they can marry legally. The decision to grant benefits to married same-sex couples in the military was welcomed by the LGBTQ+ community as a victory for equality and rights of same-sex couples in the military.\n\n## Summary:\n\nIn this summary of the article titled \"The Pentagon to grant benefits to married same-sex couples in the military\", the author discusses the recent decision by the United States Department of Defense to grant benefits to same-sex married couples in the military. The author provides background information on the legal history of same-sex marriage in the United States, including the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in 2015 to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states. The author also discusses the policy implications of the decision for the military, including the potential impact on military readiness and the potential challenges to implementing the policy in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage. The author also provides a brief overview of the history of the policy on same-sex marriage in the military, including the repeal of the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy in 2011 and the introduction of the Military Marriage Equality Act in 2013. The author also discusses the potential benefits of the decision for same-sex couples in the military, including the ability to receive spousal benefits and the potential to improve the quality of life for same-sex couples in the military. The author also discusses the potential risks of the decision, including the potential for discrimination against same-sex couples in the military and the potential","236":"The Scottish government has announced that it will meet with local councils to discuss setting a minimum level of the clothing grant that parents in the country can receive to send their children to school. The Scottish government claims that there are 250,000 families in the country who qualify to receive this grant of up to \u00a3110 per child in the West Lothian council. The clothing grant is given to families to help pay for the school uniform of their children. The Scottish government says that the amount of the clothing grant should probably be about \u00a370. The Scottish government has the power to set a minimum rate for the clothing grant but they think that the best way to achieve this is through dialogue with the local councils. The local government body Cosla has said that they will be keen to meet the Scottish government to discuss the proposal and find out what additional money the government is prepared to offer to facilitate such an agreement. In 2005, the majority of councils in the country had failed to increase the level of the clothing grant for more than a decade. In the two years since, just eight of the 32 councils in the country have increased their grants. Seventeen councils have not increased the rate in more than a decade.

Some councils in the UK lose millions of pounds of potential business rates income through a tax relief on empty properties, according to BBC analysis.\n2. The analysis showed that councils in some areas could lose up to \u00a350 million in business rates income over ten years.\n3. The mayor of Middlesbrough said the money \"added up to a lot\" and the system was unfair to councils, who rely on stable income.\n4. Business rates are paid by businesses or landlords if a property is empty, and councils currently keep around 50% of business rates in their area but are expected to keep 75% from 2021.\n5. Rates do not have to be paid on empty businesses for three months, but some councils argue that this window of time causes them to lose money.\n6. Independent mayor of Middlesbrough, Andy Preston, said that the money lost through tax relief on empty properties adds up to a lot, and that councils need a much fairer system from central government to help them sustain businesses in their area.\n7. Some councils argue that business rates should be reformed or even abolished, but fear that a major overhaul of the system could see them lose a vital source of income to fund local services.\n8. Some smaller businesses argue that the rates system should be reformed to better support small businesses, as larger companies have more resources to deal with the tax.\n\nIn conclusion, BBC analysis showed that some councils in the UK lose millions of pounds of potential business rates income through a tax relief on empty properties, and many councils argue that the current system is unfair and in need of reform.\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nTrending\n\n### Download Article:\n\nT","239":"- The Silk Mill, which tells the story of the area's industrial past, is costing \u00a3200,000 a year to run.\n- About 500 people visited on its last day, with some campaigners calling for the decision to be reviewed.\n- Derby City Council, which is looking to save \u00a325m over the next three years, said the museum cash would be reinvested in other services.\n- Campaigners Adam Kleczek said: \"Heritage is something important to us all, even if it is not profitable.\n- \"It is important because it marks who we are, and why the city is important.\"\n- Stuart Gillis, the council's head of museums, said: \"We appreciate that a number of people are sceptical about the mothballing but we want to assure the public that we will do everything we can, and engage local people in reopening the Silk Mill as quickly as possible.\"","240":"Robert Champion, a member of the Florida A&M University marching band, was beaten to death by fellow band members in a hazing ritual. This incident has raised awareness about hazing, a practice in which members of a group, often a sports team or fraternity, subject new members to physical or emotional harm in order to initiate them into the group. Hazing can include physical violence, sexual coercion, and other forms of emotional or physical abuse.\n\nDespite its harmful effects, hazing is still widely practiced in many organizations, including fraternities, sororities, and sports teams. In fact, a recent study found that 55% of college students experience some form of hazing, whether in fraternities, sororities, marching bands, varsity sports, or intramural sports.\n\nHazing is often seen as a rite of passage or a means of building group solidarity, but its negative consequences, particularly in cases of extreme physical abuse or sexual assault, are becoming more widely recognized. In recent years, several high-profile hazing incidents, such as the death of Robert Champion, have led to increased scrutiny of hazing practices and efforts to curb its prevalence.","241":"On December 4, 2011, the United States acknowledged the loss of its top secret surveillance drone in the region of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

It is seen by many as the nexus of freedom, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll which fuelled the countercultural movement of the decade. To mark the anniversary of the legendary gathering we spoke to some of those who experienced the festival first-hand. Jim Shelley was back at home in \"pre-Springsteen\" New Jersey for the summer after his first year at university in the conservative Midwest. The \"suburban white Catholic kid\" was questioning the legitimacy of the Vietnam War and started to think \"the direction the country was heading in politically was wrong\". He had developed an interest in world music and French New Wave cinema, and felt increasingly at odds with mainstream society. \"I felt like an outsider. If you were like me, people didn't like you. People didn't agree with my views on the war,\" he says. \"People thought you were a nerd, or stupid, or strange.\" For the 19-year-old, Woodstock was the first time he felt others shared his world view. \"I had never experienced anything like that before,\" he recalls. \"I remember looking around at the crowds of people like me and thinking, 'Look how many of us there are'.\" Jim describes Woodstock as \"life-affirming, rather than life-changing\". \"The attitudes I had before I went to Woodstock, which were so out of place back home, were confirmed when I was there. Woodstock made me realise I was right and my ideas were legitimate.\" His experience emboldened him and his then girlfriend - now wife - not to conform. \"My wife and I cared about the environment so we used recyclable nappies when our children were born. She was the only woman on the maternity ward to breastfeed. I was the only man to be in the delivery room.

The ruling is the latest in a legal action against the police that began with the exposure of an officer in 2010. The most well-known former officer, Mark Kennedy, infiltrated environmental groups. The appeal court judges said that the establishing and\/or maintaining of an intimate sexual relationship for the covert purpose of obtaining intelligence is a seriously intrusive form of investigatory technique. They ruled that only the IPT can adjudicate on the \"necessity and proportionality\" of techniques used by police spies. The IPT deals with complaints relating to secret surveillance powers. The appeal court said that Parliament clearly intended for human rights proceedings about relationships by undercover police officers to be ruled on by the IPT. The judges said that the proposition that sex is the thing that makes all the difference between a case that is sensitive enough to be required to be heard in a special tribunal and a case which is not so sensitive is absurd. The reason why the case needs to be heard in the special tribunal is because it relates to undercover operations, arising out of personal or other relationships. At the heart of the case is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), introduced in 2000 to regulate state surveillance. The Act does not contain specific reference to undercover relationships but says that the Human Rights Act does not apply to the IPT. The appeal court said that the IPT's jurisdiction to hear human rights claims about undercover police relationships is inextricably linked to the IPT's jurisdiction to hear claims about the legality of undercover relationships. The appeal court dismissed the claims of the undercover police officers that the IPT lacks the jurisdiction to adjudicate on human rights claims about undercover relationships. The Court of Appeal also dismissed the claims of the undercover police officers that the IPT lacks the jurisdiction to adjudicate on human rights claims about undercover relationships. The Court of Appeal said that the IPT has jurisdiction to hear the human rights claims of the undercover police officers. The IPT's jurisdiction to hear the human rights claims of the undercover police officers is inextric","245":"In a recent accident at the construction site of Marischal Square, a construction worker sustained injuries after the forklift he was operating collided with fencing within the site boundary. The incident took place last Monday, and it was revealed that the worker did not have proper certification to operate the forklift. Disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against the worker. Another site accident on February 3 also resulted in a worker suffering fractured leg and ribs. Morgan Sindall, the construction firm, said in a statement that safety is their number one priority, and incidents like this are extremely rare, but are completely unacceptable.\n\nMarischal Square is a \u00a3107 million office, leisure, and hotel development in Aberdeen, Scotland, and is due for completion in the summer. However, only 10% of office space has been taken up for lease, and the accident has raised concerns about safety and accountability at construction sites.","246":"The NASPA, the organization responsible for overseeing Scrabble tournaments, has agreed to remove offensive language from its vocabulary list in response to recent anti-racism protests in the United States and around the world. The decision comes after weeks of protests, and the NASPA has been under pressure to make the change since last year, following the death of George Floyd. However, the NASPA still allowed offensive terms in its word lists, despite Hasbro, the owner of Scrabble in North America, banning the same terms since 1994.\n\nOn Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the NASPA had agreed to remove offensive language from its lexicon, which is overseen by the NASPA Advisory Board and is available only to members. This move could also affect the online versions of the game, as the NASPA licenses its word lists to software developers.\n\nThe NASPA Advisory Board is set to vote on Thursday to officially remove the offensive terms from its vocabulary. This decision could take additional time to implement, as the NASPA will need to carefully review the terms to ensure that they are indeed offensive. However, the NASPA is confident that the offensive terms will be removed from its lexicon as soon as possible, following the decision to ban the terms from its Scrabble word lists.\n\nIn the letter to members, the NASPA CEO, John Chew, said that the decision to ban offensive terms is the right move, as playing the terms in the game declares that the desire to score points in a word game is more valuable than the term's broader function as a way to oppress a group of people. Chew also expressed concern that offensive terms in the NASPA's lexicon could turn people off from joining the organization, as it could be seen as contributing to the problem of racism.\n\nThe NASPA Advisory Board, consisting of about 1,000 members, is currently debating the issue of offensive terms in the organization's lexicon, as part of its annual meeting, which is taking place virtually. The decision to ban offensive terms will likely pass, as members of the NASPA Advisory Board have been given the chance to express their opinions on the issue in the poll, and the poll indicates that the majority of members want offensive terms to be banned from the organization's lexicon.","247":"The European People's Party (EPP) agreed to suspend Fidesz, the Hungarian ruling party, from the party. The suspension comes as a result of Fidesz officials threatening to pull out of the EPP if it was suspended. Fidesz officials also reacted defiantly to the suspension, saying that they cannot be excluded from the party. However, the suspension does not mean that Fidesz has been expelled from the EPP, but it does mean that Fidesz will not have the same rights as other members of the party. The suspension also comes as a blow for Hungarian leader Viktor Orban on the eve of an EU summit. The decision to suspend Fidesz was made by a majority of the EPP party and the penalties for Fidesz are clear and immediate. The suspension of Fidesz from the EPP also has the potential to be bad news for the centre-right bloc, as Fidesz is the dominant political force in Hungary. The suspension of Fidesz from the EPP was the result of an anti-immigration poster campaign that featured unflattering photos of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and billionaire philanthropist George Soros.\n\nLast Updated on February 23, 2022 by Essay Pro","248":"A metal barrier has been erected around a tree in Glasgow, but it has received criticism from local residents. Last year, the tree returned with a more modest white picket fence and has been moved from its traffic island to a nearby pavement. The move has been welcomed by some of the people who had called for change. Gary Cushway, former chairman of Shawlands and Strathbungo Community Council, said that the council contacted the community council in September to ask what the community wanted, and they have listened to last year's complaints and realised they needed to do something different. The tree now has a nice little white picket fence, and it has been freed from its traffic island. Thursday will see lights on the tree being turned on, and last year, unofficial efforts were made to improve the appearance of the metal barriers, including the addition of tinsel and decorations. The @shawlandstree twitter account appeared, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was among those tweeting about the issue.","249":"Nielsen\u2019s survey of new smartphone buyers in the US shows that Android accounted for 56% of those who chose a new phone in the period August 2010 to August 2011.

These adjustments include payments to encourage the keeping of small cattle herds and help for at least small amounts of crop-growing to increase the diversity of crofts ecologically and economically. The report also suggests affordable extra help, such as advice on grants and loans, should be made available to common grazings committees, young and new entrants as well as more established crofters.\n\nThe European Forum on Nature Conservation and Pastoralism prepared the report, which was commissioned by the Crofting Commission. The report suggests that existing support mechanisms do not work as well as they could for crofting and that more help is needed.\n\nThe Scottish Crofting Federation describes the research as impartial and well-presented, adding that it clearly shows that existing support mechanisms \"do not work as well as they could for crofting\". The chairman of the Scottish Crofting Federation, Russell Smith, said that the commission had taken the initiative to have the research carried out and that it demonstrates a proactive commission that is willing to be more than just a regulator.","251":"The World Health Organization is expected to announce later its view of how to circulate the research safely to scientists studying the H5N1 virus in humans. Dr Bruce Alberts, editor of Science, was asked by US security advisers not to publish parts of the work because of concerns it could help terrorists to develop a biological weapon. But he says it is important to get the research out quickly to scientists and health officials monitoring the virus. Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Vancouver, he said: \"Our position is that, in the absence of any mechanism to get the information to those scientists and health officials who need to know and need to protect their populations and to design new treatments and vaccines, our default position is that we have to publish in compete form.\" 'Academic freedom' The controversy is centred on two research papers - one of which was submitted to Science, the other to another leading journal, Nature, last year. They showed that the H5N1 virus could relatively easily mutate into a form that could spread rapidly among the human population. The studies prompted the US National Security Advisory Board for Biotechnology (NSABB) to ask both journals last November to redact some sensitive parts of the research, which it believed could be used by terrorists to develop such a virus. The request caused outcry among some scientists who believed that it was an infringement of academic freedom. Some pointed out that the scientists had given presentations about their work at conferences and the details were already widely circulated, so redaction would have little purpose. The scientists who carried out the research, and the journals concerned, have been considering the request and listening to suggestions as to how the research results could be redacted in the scientific journals, but distributed to bona fide researchers who urgently need the information","252":"The leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, criticized the government\u2019s legislative agenda for not adequately addressing economic insecurity and rewarding hard work. He pointed out the need for policies that would help the five million low-paid people and deal with the shortage of new homes. He also urged action on bank lending, energy bills, and rogue employers. The Queen\u2019s Speech, the last of the five-year coalition government, includes measures on recall of MPs, childcare, and modern slavery.\n\nMr. Miliband said that Labour backed these measures but that only a Labour government could properly address the pressing economic concerns facing millions of families.

Lawyers argued her mother had poisoned her foetus but appeal judges ruled she had not committed a criminal offence. The case was brought by a council in the North West of England, which cannot be named for legal reasons. It had been argued the woman ignored warnings and drank a \"grossly excessive\" amount of alcohol while pregnant. She consumed eight cans of strong lager and half a bottle of vodka a day, the court heard. Three appeal judges at the Court of Appeal had to rule on whether or not the girl was entitled to a payout from the government-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as a victim of crime. But Lord Justice Treacy said an \"essential ingredient\" for a crime to be committed \"is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - grievous bodily harm on a foetus will not suffice\". 'Hugely important' case The girl, who cannot be named and was referred to in court as CP, suffers with learning, development, memory and behavioural problems. BBC News legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the case was significant because it centred on whether or not a foetus was considered a person, independent of its mother. He said: \"This case was hugely important, because campaigners argued that if the Court of Appeal had said it was possible for a mother to commit a crime by poisoning her foetus with excessive alcohol, it would have had the effect of criminalising pregnant women who drank excessively, knowing the dangers of alcohol to their foetus.\" Foetal alcohol syndrome Heavy drinking during pregnancy can lead to foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol passes across the placenta from the mother to the developing foetus. But the foetus cannot process alcohol effectively until the liver is fully developed and the high levels of alcohol can affect the development of organs and the brain. Children with FAS are born with a range of disabilities, are often shorter than average and some have learning difficulties.

She told The House magazine that it was \"a very different world from the world I came from\". Mrs Bradley was appointed in January to replace James Brokenshire. Mr Brokenshire stepped down for medical reasons. \"I didn't understand things like when elections are fought for example in Northern Ireland - people who are nationalists don't vote for unionist parties and vice-versa,\" Mrs Bradley told House magazine, a weekly publication for the Houses of Parliament. \"So, the parties fight for election within their own community. \"Actually, the unionist parties fight the elections against each other in unionist communities and nationalists in nationalist communities,\" she added. Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017 after a bitter row between the governing parties, the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in. On Thursday Mrs Bradley announced that she intended to cut Stormont Assembly members' pay. Karen Bradley has also ruled out calling a fresh Assembly election and she is to bring forward legislation to allow civil servants to make decisions in the absence of devolution. MLA pay will fall in November from \u00a349,500 to \u00a335,888. In her interview with House Magazine she said: \"I had no idea how wonderful Northern Ireland was.

The program, titled 14-18 NOW, will begin in June and culminate on August 4, the anniversary of the declaration of war. The date will be marked with a Late Night Prom and followed by Lights Out, where people will be invited to turn off their lights and use a single light. The large-scale event, 100 years after Britain declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914, is aiming to echo Sir Edward Grey's famous epitaph \"the lamps are going out all over Europe\". Events will take place across the UK involving a host of leading arts figures including authors Malorie Blackman and Sebastian Faulks, directors Neil Bartlett and Katie Mitchell, actor Stephen Fry and cartoonist Ralph Steadman. Other highlights include a BalletBoyz production Young Me, drawing inspiration from images of the war, and visual arts project Dazzle Ships - in which contemporary artists such as Carlos Cruz-Diez will paint the exteriors of war ships in Liverpool and London, echoing the \"dazzle camouflage\" used in World War One. Artists will also create works in response to World War One on the salt-marshes of Orford Ness, in Glasgow's Merchant City and on the site of the trials of conscientious objectors in London's Battersea. The 2014 commissions announced on Thursday are to mark the first of three \"key moments\" - with two more series of events set to mark the start of the Battle of the Somme in July 2016 and the centenary of the Armistice in November 2018. Everyone in the UK is invited to take part in Letter to an Unknown Soldier, billed as \"a new kind of war memorial\" made entirely from words by Kate Pullinger and Neil Bartlett.

It has to cut its budget for adult services by \u00a3125m over the next four years and is looking for ways to save money. The council had a consultation with the public to find out which of three options was the most popular: to run its own homes, sell the homes to private care home providers or close the homes and use the money to pay for places in private sector homes. The results of the consultation showed that 53% of respondents favoured selling the homes to private care home providers. However, 31% of respondents did not agree with any of the proposed options. The council's spokesperson, Colin Noble, said that the key thing is that the council is spending \u00a33-4m more by providing its own homes rather than paying for places in the private sector. The consultation put forward three options for the council: to run its own homes, sell the homes to private care home providers or close the homes and use the money to pay for places in private sector homes. The consultation showed that 6% of respondents supported the option to close the homes and use the money to pay for places in private sector homes. The Liberal Democrat spokesperson, Inga Lockington, said that the council has not made its mind up yet and that it is not clear what option they will choose. Mr Noble said that the council will announce which of the options they intend to move forward on at a meeting on 29 March 2011 and that in probably about a year's time you should start to see things happening on the ground.","279":"- The Education Minister, Deputy James Reed, said the \u00a367,000 spent on the assistants was not needed to give students a good language education.\n- Treasury and Resources Minister Senator Philip Ozouf voted against the cut.\n- The States is debating and voting on budgets for 2011 with spending cuts of 2% ordered across all departments.\n- Senator Ozouf voted in favour of an amendment to keep the language assistants.\n- He told the States of Jersey: \"I've got the very clear message from islanders that they want the States, if they are going to be asked to pay some more tax... to cut spending. \"They want to see the States deliver services more efficiently and they want the States to balance the books.\"\n- Members also voted to reduce the number of educational psychologists from six to five, saving the education department \u00a388,000 a year when an amendment to save the post was rejected.","280":"-Sophie Lee, a runner from Hull, has experienced harassment during her runs, including people shouting at her and trying to touch her.\n-A third of female runners have experienced harassment while exercising alone, according to England Athletics.\n-Lois England, a runner from Hull, said she is abused on \"pretty much every run\" when on her own.\n-Megan Hatfield, a runner from Hull, said people make inappropriate comments when they see her exercising.\n-Humberside Police said shouting unsolicited and unwanted comments could be an offence and victims should report it.\n-Sarah McDonald, a GB athlete, has experienced abuse during her runs, including being grabbed by a man on a moped.","281":"A new article has been released, titled \"The TUC is calling on employers to allow staff to wear more casual clothing as the temperature soars.\" The article discusses the TUC's recommendations for employers to provide a cool and comfortable work environment, as well as the potential dangers of working in a hot office or factory.

The International Committee of the Red Cross warned in October that Madagascar was at risk of a plague epidemic. The disease is transmitted to humans via fleas, usually from rats. Bubonic plague, known as the Black Death when it killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, is now rare. Last year, Madagascar had 60 deaths from the plague, the world's highest recorded number. The Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed on Tuesday that tests taken from bodies in the village last week showed that they had died of the bubonic plague. The BBC's Tim Healy in the capital, Antananarivo, says health officials have now gone to the remote area to investigate. There has been a programme to exterminate rats, fleas and cockroaches in Madagascar's prisons to avoid outbreaks of the plague, which is spread because of unhygienic conditions, he says. The Pasteur Institute said there were concerns that the disease could spread to towns and cities where living standards have declined since a coup in 2009 and the ensuing political crisis.

The National Autistic Society said Ms Cooper was \"incredibly talented\" and had done well to overcome her nerves. After writing the lyrics with her mother, Ms Cooper's music teacher Christopher Bond wrote the accompanying music. They posted a video of her performing the song online and it \"went through the roof\", Ms Morgan said. A post of her performance on the Autism World Awareness Day Facebook page was viewed 52,000 times and shared by hundreds. Ms Morgan said Mr Bond had been \"like a godsend\" to her daughter. Ms Cooper taught herself to play different instruments in her bedroom for years. She now plays the cornet in Gwaun Cae Gurwen Brass Band in Cwmgors near Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, and is less isolated as a result. Ms Cooper attends a day care centre two days a week and has even performed the song in front of an audience of 30. The 22-year-old was born healthy and hit all of her milestones, but from the age of nine she started regressing, losing the skills she had learnt. \"She wasn't coping in school and wouldn't stay in the classes. She'd be walking the corridors and everything changed,\" Ms Morgan said. After she was diagnosed with autism, \"she went through a time where she just wanted to stay in bed all the time\". Ms Cooper had speech and language therapy and saw a psychologist. She has been told she will need help with speech and language for the rest of her life. \"If it wasn't for her music, I wouldn't like to think... She was in a bad place,\" Ms Morgan said. Mr Bond, a musician and a brass teacher, has been teaching Ms Cooper at Tongwynlais Academy in Cardiff where she has been taking cornet lessons. \"It soon became clear that Gemma wanted to write a Christmas song and that involved her singing.

Britney's father has been her legal conservator for more than a decade, and some of her fans believe she was forced into the arrangement.

Such an arrangement is usually granted for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or some other mental health difficulties. The new court filing does not explain what role it could play in the singer's protracted conservatorship case. The conservatorship has been extended to 2021 despite the singer's lawyers telling the court earlier this month that she is \"strongly opposed\" to her father remaining the sole conservator of her personal and financial well-being. The conservatorship was set up when the star began behaving erratically in 2007 after her divorce from Kevin Federline, and she lost custody of their two children (although she has full custody now).\n\nRead the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Tower Hamlets Council has signed off a \u00a32m \"extraordinary cost item\" from its children's services budget to cover the potential fine and legal costs.

Tower Hamlets Council has apologised to Alexia's mother, friends and family for their unbearable loss and expressed regret that Alexia died in Mile End Park where she should have been safe. The Crown Prosecution Service has ruled that while there had been a series of failings, it would not pursue manslaughter charges against the council over the child's death.

The US banned companies from selling components and technology to Huawei and 68 related companies on 15 May, citing national security concerns.\n8. The US has also put pressure on its allies to exclude the Chinese firm's technology from being used in 5G networks, claiming that it posed a risk to national security - something that Huawei has denied.\n9.

If MLAs support the motion, Mr Kennedy's appointment will be \"effective immediately.\" The commissioner is expected to investigate complaints retrospectively if they were submitted within six months of the alleged breach of the code.\n\nRead the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences. Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nBy Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter BBC News NI has seen a letter from the speaker to all MLAs stating that the assembly commission intends to nominate Paul Kennedy for the role. The position has been vacant since Douglas Bain's term of office ended in 2017. Mr Kennedy has been a solicitor for 37 years and is said to have \"extensive investigative experience\". The letter, sent to all MLAs on Tuesday, states that the assembly commission has asked the business committee to schedule a motion for debate on 21 July, and will require MLAs to approve the formal appointment. If MLAs support the motion, Mr Kennedy's appointment will be \"effective immediately,\" the letter adds. The role of the commissioner is to act independently to investigate formal complaints against MLAs for alleged breaches of the code of conduct. But the post has been empty since Douglas Bain stood down from the role in 2017 after his five-year term ended. The position could not be filled at that time because the power-sharing executive had collapsed and since then, complaints have continued to be made but there has been no-one to investigate them. The role has come back into the spotlight following complaints by some MLAs about Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill's attendance at the funeral of senior IRA figure Bobby Storey. Last week, Mr Bain said it was \"frankly ridiculous\" that the public could make a complaint about Ms O'Neill or any other MLA, but nothing could happen as the post remained unfilled.

Many try repeatedly to pass the ENA's notoriously tough entrance exams, so desperate are they to get in. But the Strasbourg school's most powerful ex-pupil is reportedly turning against it. Determined to quell the gilets jaunes (\"yellow vest\") protest movement, President Emmanuel Macron has proposed abolishing the ENA, according to the text of an upcoming speech leaked to French media. \"If we want to build a society of equal opportunity and national excellence, we must reset the rules for recruitment, careers and access to the upper echelons of the civil service,\" he is quoted as saying. \"That's why we will change the system of training, selection and career development by getting rid of the ENA and several other institutions.\" The president's office has declined to comment on the leaked text. French media say it was to be in his address to the nation marking the conclusion of a two-month great debate. But the speech was postponed because of the Notre-Dame fire. What is the ENA? It was established in 1945 by then French President Charles de Gaulle, in the immediate aftermath of World War Two. It was created \"with a spirit of reconstructing France and renovating the state\", said anthropologist Ir\u00e8ne Bellier of France's National Centre for Scientific Research. \"The ideology was you'd raise a group of people capable of acting in the public interest.\" Prior to its creation, each ministry had its own hiring process and standards, resulting in closed networks that almost exclusively favoured the upper class.

The figure includes the \u00a344m spent on a public inquiry. Plaid Cymru said it was an \"obscene amount of public money\" but Transport Minister Ken Skates said it would not be wasted. The first minister Mark Drakeford said the scheme would damage the Gwent Levels, despite a planning inspector saying there was a compelling case for the project. Instead, a commission of experts will look at \"innovative\" ways of solving congestion issues, reporting back initial findings in six-months' time. The commission will be chaired by Lord Burns - current chairman of media regulator Ofcom and a former permanent secretary to the UK Treasury. The Welsh Government said the \u00a3114m includes the costs of a judicial review, and \"necessary project development\". The Welsh Government said the \u00a3114m \"will be put to good use by the commission, making sure it is fully informed\". But Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"The Welsh Government should be thoroughly embarrassed that its failure to make a timely decision has meant that such an obscene amount of public money has been wasted.\" Currently, tailbacks often occur on the M4 near Newport, affecting traffic coming from south Wales and the west of England. The scheme was intended to ease congestion, but the government's decision to scrap it is likely to anger commuters who use the motorway regularly. It is hoped that the commission will come up with alternative ways of tackling the problem.","323":"The government has approved the supply of equipment by the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei for the UK's new 5G data network - despite warnings of a security risk.

The senior minister said leaking from the council was \"simply not acceptable\". The government is also considering whether to allow equipment from Huawei to be used in the construction of the new 5G data network, which could have long-term consequences for national security. However, the decision has been met with criticism from some quarters, with concerns being raised over the risk of espionage or sabotage. The government has denied there is any risk of espionage or sabotage, and Huawei has also denied that it is controlled by the Chinese government. The leak of information from the National Security Council has caused a stir, with the senior minister saying that leaking the conversations was \"extraordinary...the security council is the holy of holies\".

The gains were driven by strong consumer spending and a surge in exports as firms rushed to beat new trade tariffs. US President Donald Trump described the acceleration as \"amazing\", claiming it as proof his policies are working. However, many analysts cautioned that growth could cool in coming months. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, stated that the report showed \"one line: Looks great; won't last\". Consumer spending rose by 4% in the second quarter, up from the 0.5% rate seen in the previous three months. Exports also grew by more than 9%, the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 2013. Economists say that figure, which contributed more than 1% to the GDP gains, was inflated in part by farmers seeking to get ahead of new trade tariffs on items such as soybeans. In July, the US and China imposed tariffs on $34bn of the other country's goods. Canada, Mexico and the European Union also imposed new duties in recent weeks on some US exports in retaliation for US tariffs on steel and aluminium. President Trump stated that the White House had to \"do a lot of things\" to get the economy going again. He pointed to new tax cuts, de-regulation, increased government spending and the continuing trade negotiations. While Friday's report showed the US economy accelerating, the gains were in line with analyst forecasts - and were not out of proportion with some quarters in previous years. In 2014, for example, the economy rose at an annual rate of 5.1% in the second quarter and by 4.9% in the third quarter. Compared with the second quarter of 2017, the economy grew by 2.8% in the April-June period.","326":"The rock fall occurred at Jiggers Bank, a main road into the Ironbridge Gorge, overnight on Tuesday. It is said to be a rare event, and the road is expected to remain closed until Saturday evening at the earliest. The authority has said that traffic has been diverted from Dale End via the Buildwas bypass while engineers carry out stabilisation work. Jiggers Bank was closed for about two weeks last month while essential maintenance work was carried out. The location of the rock fall was not where the maintenance was done. The incident was probably the result of \"recent weather changes we are having - particularly heavy rain fall and the start of a cold snap\". The rocks around the hole left on the rock face were weathered, and engineers were assessing and stabilising the area on Thursday. Jiggers Bank was also closed for several weeks in the summer of 2008 while stabilisation work was carried out. A reinforced concrete buttress was installed to stabilise rocks near the top of the bank. The council has said it would post updates about the latest situation on its website, Facebook and Twitter pages.","327":"The Russian coastguard is towing the ship Arctic Sunrise towards the city of Murmansk, a journey expected to take several days. Four of the Greenpeace activists had tried to board a Gazprom oil rig on Wednesday, to protest against drilling. Russia accused Greenpeace of violating an exclusion zone around the rig, but the group said its ship was in international waters. Greenpeace published photos that it said showed Russian security personnel in balaclavas confronting the activists with guns and knives after abseiling from helicopters onto the Dutch-flagged Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace says planned drilling at Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya rig in the Barents Sea threatens a unique and fragile environment - a claim denied by Moscow. The safety of our activists remains our top priority and we are working hard to establish what is facing them,\" said Ben Ayliffe, head of Greenpeace International's Arctic oil campaign. \"They have done nothing to warrant this level of aggression and have been entirely peaceful throughout,\" he said. Greenpeace dismissed claims that a safety pod on the ship in any way resembled a bomb. The group of activists being held includes six Britons. A spokeswoman for the Murmansk region's border guards told local media that the Arctic Sunrise's captain had already been questioned, and the activists were being taken to court for \"further legal procedures\". The Russian foreign ministry earlier accused the group of \"aggressive and provocative\" behaviour. Moscow also said that its coastguard vessel had to fire warning shots across Arctic Sunrise. The Gazprom project is Russia's first effort to extract oil from the Barents Sea. Prirazlomnaya is scheduled to begin production by the end of the year. Russia's economy and its recent growth depend to a large extent on income from its huge oil and gas deposits.","328":"The government's plan to support workers at firms forced to close under tougher Covid restrictions will not \"cut it\", according to a leading social policy expert. Louise Casey warned that many \"normal people, trying to get on in normal lives\" could fall into poverty. The Treasury said its priority was to protect jobs and incomes and it had made \"our welfare system more generous\". The furlough scheme - under which the government and firms are together paying up to 80% of people's wages, to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month - ends on 31 October. Under its replacement, the job support scheme, those in \"viable jobs\" able to work at least one-third of their hours will get 77% of their pay, with the government contribution capped at \u00a3697.92 per month. Employees at UK firms ordered to close completely will get 67% of wages of their usual salary paid - up to a maximum of \u00a32,100 a month. Dame Louise told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg this was \"not going to be good enough\". She said: \"It's like you're saying to people, 'You can only afford two-thirds of your rent, you can only afford two-thirds of the food that you need to put on the table.' \"There's this sense from Downing Street and from Westminster that people will make do. Well, they weren't coping before Covid.\" In England, so far only Liverpool has been placed in the highest Tier 3 restrictions, under which pubs and bars not serving meals will be closed. But other areas, particularly in northern England, could soon follow if Covid infection rates continue to rise sharply. Pubs and restaurants across central Scotland have also been closed until 25 October. \"We are looking at a period of destitution,\" said Dame Louise. \"I can't impress upon you enough that I think we are heading into an unprecedented period. We're already in it and it's going to get worse. And it needs a more cross-government cross-society response.\" \"Do we want to go back to the days when people are in destitution, when people are on the streets, when people are not able to afford to feed their children? That is where we are going if we don't act now.\"","329":"The article discusses the upcoming formal planning process for Cardiff Parkway, a new train station that will serve a business park and up to 32,000 residents. Developers claim that the station will reduce travel time to the city centre from an hour to just six minutes by rail. UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has expressed his support for the project, and stated that he will \"work with the promoters of the scheme as they develop their plans to the next stage.\" The station is expected to cost \u00a317m, and the car park will cost \u00a312m, with the opening expected in February 2020. The article also mentions the cancellation of plans to electrify the main line from Cardiff to Swansea. The St Mellons project has been in the pipeline for 10 years and has involved buying land from seven farmers. Cardiff Parkway Developments director Andrew Roberts expressed his optimism about the project, stating that they hope to have spades in the ground within a year.

Guernsey's Treasury and Resources Department has requested permission from the States to guarantee a loan or lease for the airline. Flybe, the other carrier on the route, announced it would stop flying the route from 29 March 2014 after agreeing to sell its Gatwick slots to Easyjet. The security of links between the island and London was one of the main reasons behind the States' purchase of the Aurigny Group in 2003. By the end of 2012, the airline had accumulated losses of \u00a312.5m. Treasury and Resources Minister Gavin St Pier said: \"Aurigny is already the market leader on the Gatwick route, carrying just under 200,000 passengers last year. \"However, whilst it does have some current spare capacity, there is no practical way for it to accommodate the 146,000 passengers carried by Flybe in 2012 without expanding its own services. \"Both the department and the airline recognise the strategic importance of the Gatwick route to the island. It is essential that there is confidence a good service capable of meeting current demand will be maintained and that passengers can see we are absolutely committed to ensuring this is the case.\" A treasury spokesman said the air links were a \"major factor in the long-term success\" of the island's finance and business services, which generate more than 50% of the island's gross domestic product. Large jet aircraft The options to expand Aurigny's services are the introduction of larger jet aircraft on existing schedules or the operation of smaller turboprops at increased frequencies or a combination of both. All of these options would require the purchase of new aircraft. While the airline investigates the options the department has asked the States for permission to guarantee any loans or leases for the airline. The introduction of larger aircraft would result in increased capacity and the ability to offer additional frequencies. This would be beneficial for the island as it would increase the number of flights available and the number of passengers that can be carried. The increased capacity would also allow for the introduction of new routes and the ability to serve new markets. The addition of smaller turboprop aircraft would also allow for increased frequencies and the ability to serve new routes.

There will also be overnight events being held in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Co Down, and a commemorative service the following day at Manchester Cathedral. The battle took place in northern France and resulted in more than 600,000 British and French casualties. The announcement was made by Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, who said: \"We must never forget the scale of what happened at the Somme. \"More died on the first day of battle than any other day of the First World War. Almost every family in the country was touched by the devastating losses. \"I hope people of all generations up and down the country will have the chance to attend an event and honour the bravery of those who sacrificed so much.\" The overnight vigils on 30 June will take place at Westminster Abbey, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Co Down, while a programme of overnight events will be held at the Imperial War Museum in London. A commemorative service will be held on 1 July at Manchester Cathedral, followed by a procession through the city to Heaton Park. Further events will take place at Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and memorials. The government had already announced plans for an event on 1 July at Thiepval in northern France, where a memorial holds the names of 72,000 fallen soldiers who have no known graves. Around 10,000 people are expected to attend next year's event at the memorial, with 8,000 selected by ballot. The Battle of the Somme began on 1 July 1916 and did not end until 18 November that year. The aim of the offensive was to achieve a clear victory for the British and French, but the campaign turned into a stalemate, with soldiers struggling to gain any ground after heavy rains in October.","333":"The article is about the movies that make people cry.

The Egyptian mediation has brought calm in the region. The opening of the crossings came amid mediation efforts by Egypt. Restrictions on fishing off the coast of Hamas-ruled Gaza have also been lifted. But the fragility of the \"calm\" negotiated by Egypt was illustrated by further overnight firing, though no-one was hurt. Israel said five rockets were launched from Gaza at the Eshkol region but it has not been confirmed which group carried out the attack. Israel fired on Hamas posts in response. The rocket attack which prompted Monday's border closure and the Israeli military response struck a house in a village near Tel Aviv leaving seven people injured. Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza border on Saturday, marking one year since the start of border demonstrations. The protests are to push for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel. According to Palestinian officials, three protesters were shot dead by Israeli troops during the protests, and another another was killed earlier on Saturday. The Israeli Defense Forces said explosive devices had been thrown over the border fence. Israeli forces had responded with \"riot dispersal means\" and live bullets. Israel says Hamas is a terrorist group and accuses it of using the demonstrations as a cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. According to the UN, at least 189 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed in similar protests between March and December 2018. The latest Egyptian-mediated negotiation saw Hamas agree to ensuring the protests do not escalate in return for Israel allowing the flow of goods across the Gaza border to resume, Palestinian officials say.\n\n##### Do you need a similar assignment done for you from scratch?

But this is proving the prime minister's toughest task to date. Despite her offer to step down if MPs back the deal, the DUP insists it will not vote for it.\n\nThe DUP's 10 MPs have voted against the deal twice before, warning that the plan as it stands poses a risk to the integrity of the union of the United Kingdom. They oppose the Irish border backstop in the Brexit deal - the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found.\n\nThe DUP believes if it took effect, it would cause trade differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and create a \"border down the Irish Sea\". As I have written before, the DUP takes pride in placing the union above all else. Although the party has been involved in negotiations with ministers to see what it would take for the DUP to back the deal, it has yet to inch towards giving the government the green light. DUP sources describe as \"offensive\" the suggestion that more money could sway them. The party came to prominence after 2017's snap election when it negotiated \u00a31bn for Northern Ireland in exchange for entering a confidence-and-supply pact. That arrangement is due to expire this year - but the DUP insists it has not asked for cash in these Brexit talks.\n\nBut what has the party asked for? Officially, the DUP says it won't provide a running commentary while discussions are ongoing. In one sense, though, its stance has shifted slightly. Last November, at the party's annual conference, deputy leader Nigel Dodds demanded that the government \"bin the backstop\". He was supported that day by the appearance of ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said it was time for the backstop to be \"junked\". More recently, that call has disappeared in favour of calls for legally binding assurances\n\nAuthor:\n\nJayne McCormack is a BBC News NI Political Reporter.

The scheme will see payments available to businesses every fortnight that they are closed, on a tiered level. The thresholds are: Small businesses will receive \u00a31,600 every fortnight that they are in lockdown, medium businesses \u00a32,400 and large firms getting \u00a33,200. The finance minister said it would not change the difficult economic outlook that businesses in Northern Ireland are facing. The Derry City and Strabane scheme opened for applications on Wednesday, and the update in payments will be backdated. Hospitality businesses there have been under additional restrictions since 5 October. Some businesses will also be able to continue to avail of the UK government's furlough scheme but that runs out at the end of October. The First Minister Arlene Foster also addressed the press conference and said she wanted to provide further clarity on some of the new restrictions. From Friday evening, pubs, restaurants and cafes will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery services for four weeks. Hair and beauty salons have to shut and gyms face additional measures too. Mrs Foster confirmed that hotels will have to close their doors on Friday night to all but a few exceptions. There will be exemptions for them to offer rooms to essential workers such as workers who need hotels for work-related purposes and \"staff on the front line battling Covid\". It will also apply to people who are unable to return to their main address, those in emergency situations and vulnerable people for the four-week period. She added that if people are resident in a hotel by 18:00 on Friday, they can remain there during the lockdown. The new lockdown scheme is a temporary measure that will help businesses to survive during the difficult economic outlook.\n\nQuestion:\n\n1.

Tony Roberts has been confirmed as the Conservatives' new nominee. The offence bars Mike Quigley, former head of Bassetlaw District Council, from standing as a candidate in the elections on 15 November. Home Office rules say anyone convicted of an offence which could attract a prison sentence cannot be a candidate. Tony Roberts has been confirmed as the Conservatives' new nominee. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 disqualifies a person from standing for election as a police and crime commissioner (PCC) if they have, at any time, been convicted of an imprisonable offence. A number of candidates across England and Wales have been forced to stand down because of previous crimes. Earlier in August, Labour's Bob Ashford said a crime committed when he was 13 had blocked him from the candidacy in Avon and Somerset. And Labour's candidate for Derbyshire, Alan Charles, initially stood down but was reinstated after lawyers advised him a conditional discharge he received for stealing a woman's purse 47 years ago would not bar him from standing. 'Challenge ahead' Speaking at the annual general meeting of the Nottingham Area Conservatives, Mr Quigley said: \"It is with regret that I must stand down following confirmation that an offence committed more than 44 years ago, for which I was fined, bars me from the post.\" Mr Quigley did not disclose what the offence was. Mr Roberts, Newark and Sherwood District Councillor, said: \"I learned of Mike Quigley's withdrawal as a candidate with surprise as I knew he was keen to fulfil the role. \"I recognise the significance of the task that now lies ahead of me and welcome the challenge.\" Mr Roberts will be up against former Labour MP Paddy Tipping for the job.

This could open the door to better ways of diagnosing psychiatric conditions including depression, according to the lead author, Dr. Andres Herane-Vives. He also developed a new type of swab that won't damage the eardrum. Cortisol is known as your \"fight or flight\" hormone. It sends out alarm signals to the brain in response to stress and can influence almost every system in the body, from the immune system to digestion and sleep. However, its role in disorders including anxiety and depression is not fully understood. Dr. Herane-Vives wants to understand what raised or lowered levels of cortisol might indicate. It's early days, but he hopes this could eventually help him establish an \"objective biological measure\" for psychiatric conditions. In theory, people with mental health symptoms could have their levels of cortisol tested, and this could help to inform their diagnosis. Currently, mental health diagnosis is largely subjective, so this could provide professionals with an additional tool to help make their assessments more accurate. And a good diagnosis is \"the only way to provide the right treatment,\" said Dr. Herane-Vives. It could potentially be used to inform who might or might not benefit from anti-depressants. Cortisol can be measured in blood, but this only gives a snapshot of an individual's levels of the hormone in that moment. And since blood tests themselves can be stressful, this can potentially give false positives. Dr. Herane-Vives wanted to see if a patient's chronic cortisol levels - what they looked like over a longer period of time - could be measured by looking at tissues in the body where it accumulates. He previously studied whether cortisol could be measured from hair follicles, but to do that, it requires taking a hair sample, which is not always easy to get. He decided to look at the ear canal as a more accessible and easier-to-collect source of the hormone.","346":"The UK government has announced a plan to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2040, and to spend \u00a3255m to help councils tackle air pollution. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was determined to deliver a \"green revolution\" and promised \u00a340m immediately to start local schemes rolling. Environmental groups criticised the decision not to include a scrappage scheme or immediate clean air zones.\n\nThe plan to stop all sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is part of the government's intention for almost every car and van on UK roads to be zero emission by 2050. The government report includes the promise of \u00a340m immediately to start local schemes rolling, which could include changing road layouts, retrofitting public transport or schemes to encourage people to leave their cars at home. The funding pot will come from changes to tax on diesel vehicles and the reprioritising departmental budgets - the exact details will be announced later in the year.\n\nWhile air pollution has been mostly falling in the UK, in many cities, nitrogen oxides - which form part of the discharge from car exhausts - regularly breach safe levels. Mr Grayling said the new plan showed the government was \"determined to deliver a green revolution in transport and reduce pollution in our towns and cities\". But campaigners say these are the measures that need to be implemented now to tackle environmental and health problems, with air pollution linked to about 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK.\n\nProfessor Neena Modi, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said air pollution \"is a public health emergency\" and said it was \"frankly inexcusable\" that the plans still did not go far enough.

Bailiffs and police moved in at about 0100 BST, although a handful of activists tied themselves to scaffolding. They have now been removed and a fence has been put up around the square. A group of people have continued their protest on the pavement with some brandishing banners emblazoned with \"the dispossessed\". They say they will go back when the fence comes down. However the eviction order is not to be applied to the best-known protester in Parliament Square, Brian Haw. Mr Haw, from Redditch, Worcestershire, who has camped there since 2001, successfully fought to be allowed to continue his demonstration after it was made illegal to hold an unauthorised protest within a square mile of Parliament in 2007. It took about 60 bailiffs four hours to remove all the protesters. Londoner Maria Gallastegui, 51, said: \"No-one was hurt but people were forcibly removed. \"There are certainly a few bruises.\" She added that at least one protester was chained to the scaffolding and another was on top of a lorry containing fencing which was to be put around the square. Anti-war demonstrators and climate change activists had been among those who set up camp in the square, opposite the Houses of Parliament. London Mayor Boris Johnson, who took legal action to remove the Democracy Village, had criticised the spectacle as \"nauseating\". A spokeswoman for the mayor said the protest had caused \"considerable damage\" to the site. \"The square will now be closed temporarily, during which time the site will be restored for the use of Londoners, visitors to the capital and responsible protesters,\" she added.

The airline later apologized and clarified that it was taking a \"neutral\" position on the debate. Several other American companies, including United Airlines, also dropped ties to the NRA in response to calls for a boycott of the organization's corporate partners on social media. The NRA's top lobbyist met with President Trump at the White House, with both sides saying they had a \"great\" meeting. However, President Trump had earlier surprised members of Congress by accusing them of being \"petrified\" of the NRA and urging them to come up with a \"strong\" reform bill on gun control. The shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school on 14 February left 17 people dead. The suspect in the shooting, Nikolas Cruz, was said to be obsessed with guns and bought the semi-automatic rifle he allegedly used at the school legally last year while aged 18. The shooting has renewed a national debate on gun control. Georgia Republicans vowed to strip a bill of a jet fuel tax exemption that would benefit Delta as a result of the airline's decision to end its discount for NRA members. The state House of Representatives and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, passed a sweeping tax package within hours of each other on Thursday that was amended to exclude a $50m (\u00a336m) sales-tax exemption. Governor Nathan Deal tweeted on Friday that he had signed the bill into law. The airline irritated state lawmakers on Saturday after it dropped its discount for NRA members in the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

Credit Agricole will study the European Commission's findings. Penalties for the guilty are up to 10% of annual revenue. Euribor is a cousin to Libor, which is used to set trillions of dollars of financial contracts from complex financial transactions to car loans. In December, the Commission imposed fines totalling 1.04bn euros on Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale as part of the same investigation. Barclays escaped a fine as it had notified the Commission of the existence of the cartel, and the others were granted a 10% reduction in their fine for agreeing to a settlement. The EU's competition body said: \"The Commission has concerns that the three banks may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro interest rate derivatives.\" JP Morgan said it had \"co-operated fully with the European Commission throughout its investigation.\" The bank said it believed that the competition concerns were \"without merit\", and added it intended to \"defend itself fully\". HSBC said: \"We intend to defend ourselves vigorously.\" Cartel? The Commission's investigation has centred around concerns that the banks may have manipulated the pricing of interest rate derivatives - financial products which are used by banks to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The products derive their value from \"Euribor\", a benchmark interest rate which is the eurozone equivalent of Libor. In March 2013, the Commission opened proceedings regarding Credit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan, and the investigation as whether they were part of a Euribor rate-rigging cartel is continuing. Should the banks be fined, they will not receive any reduction in penalties, competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.","360":"This article is about the Gradam Ceoil traditional music awards, which were held in Belfast for the first time.

While \u00a31.6bn had been made available, Chris Pincher, the housing minister, told MPs that the government would not write an \"open cheque\". It was up to developers and building owners to \"step up\" and take primary responsibility for repairs, he added. MPs say delays to the process and uncertainty over who will pay are causing \"unimaginable anxiety\". Raising the issue in the Commons, Labour's Clive Betts said government support was \"totally inadequate\" given the cost of removing aluminium composite and other dangerous materials could be as much as \u00a315bn. After the 2017 Grenfell fire, the government pledged safe alternatives to dangerous cladding would be provided on all buildings in England taller than 18 metres by last June. But a report in September found that only 155 out of 455 high-rise buildings with similar cladding to Grenfell have had it replaced. To speed up the process, the Commons Housing Committee said the government should foot the bill for the work in the short term, looking to recover costs from those responsible for historic construction failures at a later date. 'Good faith' Mr Betts, the committee's chair, said the issue had dragged on for too long and urgent action was needed. \"Leaseholders should not have to pay any of the costs. They bought their properties in good faith, they have not done anything wrong and they should not be financially distressed,\" he said. \"Without assurances on these points, many people are going to have a very miserable Christmas, trapped in properties they can't sell, often they can't insure...and wondering how on earth they are going to pay for the bills that could arrive on their doormats at any time.\" He was backed by Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP in the Commons, who said delays to fixing high-rise and other affected buildings had effectively \"frozen\" parts of the leasehold property market.

BAA, which was ordered to sell both Stansted and Gatwick airports, had already started the process of finding a buyer for Gatwick. The commission also ordered BAA to sell off either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports. BAA decided not to challenge the Stansted ruling in the Supreme Court, the last opportunity it had to appeal. The company believes that the ruling fails to recognize that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets. Ryanair, which has long been critical of the way BAA ran Stansted, welcomed the decision to proceed with the sale. The company blames lack of competition for the declining passenger numbers at Stansted, which carried 6 million fewer passengers in 2011 than in 2007. When the inquiry process was launched five years ago, BAA owned seven UK airports, carrying 60% of all UK air passengers. It had a virtual monopoly over airports in the South East of England, where Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton carried 90% of air passengers in the area. Its Scottish airports - Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen - accounted for 84% of airport passengers in Scotland. BAA has recently completed the sale of Edinburgh airport.

He was due to begin his prison sentence on 14 July, but President Trump commuted his sentence on 10 July. The published clemency order shows this includes the commuting of a $20,000 (\u00a315,930) fine and a two-year term of supervised release. It does not, however, annul his criminal record.\n\nStone was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He had been due to report to a federal prison in Georgia on 14 July. Speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday night, Stone said he believed his reprieve had saved him from \"a near-death sentence\". \"I was literally hours away from being sent to a Covid-infested prison in violation of the current Bureau of Prisons and DoJ [Department of Justice] policies,\" he said in his first TV appearance since Friday's presidential clemency.

It wasn't stilted, it was brief. He asked how my wife was doing. \"He told me he signed an act of clemency which was a full commutation.

Earlier this month, the government gave the go-ahead for the plant which will power nearly six million homes. It will be the UK's first new nuclear plant in a generation. The meeting was a second attempt at finalising the deal after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly announced in July that she wanted time to scrutinise it. With her approval now granted and the contracts updated, the formal signing took place at a ceremony attended by Business Secretary Greg Clark and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. China's National Energy Administration director, Nur Bekri, and the chairman of Chinese firm CGN, He Yu, also attended. Mr Clark said that signing the contract was a \"crucial moment\" and that Hinkley played \"an important part in ensuring our future low-carbon energy security\". Mr Ayrault said he was pleased that the UK government had decided to go ahead with the project. Dozens of contracts running to thousands of pages for the huge project in Somerset are believed to have been prepared ahead of the event. The key document is the Contract for Difference, or CfD, which gives a guaranteed price for the electricity Hinkley will generate for 35 years. In return EDF, along with CGN, will finance the project and shoulder the risk of any delays. Critics say the guaranteed \"strike price\" - which is more than twice the current wholesale cost of electricity - will provide a windfall for EDF for decades to come. The formal go-ahead for Hinkley also cements China's foothold in Britain's nuclear industry. The last government signed a series of co-operation agreements in civil nuclear power with Beijing which opened the UK's market to Chinese firms.

The move follows a consultation in which the vast majority of respondents supported the measure. The Scottish government said that more than 80% of slaughterhouses in Scotland already had CCTV cameras voluntarily, but that the standards of CCTV coverage could vary, and that legislation was needed to \"improve further the already high standards being followed by the livestock sector in Scotland.\" Animal rights groups have claimed that the abuse of animals is widespread in slaughterhouses, and believe that independently-monitored CCTV cameras will help to limit their suffering. The Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers welcomed the Scottish government announcement, but said that more than 95% of animals slaughtered in Scotland go through abattoirs that already use CCTV systems. It also insisted that the industry had an \"open and transparent approach\" with the veterinary authorities and follows strict welfare controls which are monitored by Food Standards Scotland. A spokesman for the association said some existing CCTV systems may need to be upgraded or completely replaced under the proposals, and called for assurances that the industry will be given help to meet any additional costs as has already happened in Wales.\n\nFor questions, comments and feedback, please email us.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Compass Learning Systems, Inc.

The borough council, which led the project, called the reopening a \"major milestone\" for the park. The Venetian Waterways were opened in 1928, having been commissioned by the borough council as a way to create work after World War One. Restoration began in June and has been supported by 78 volunteers from the Green Gym, who have contributed nearly 1,300 hours of work. The island cafe and pergolas have been renovated, and the original planting - celebrated at the 1928 RHS International Exhibition of Gardening Design - has also been revived. Work is continuing on the neighbouring boating lake and will be finished by summer. Kate Watts, strategic director for Great Yarmouth Borough Council, said: \"The attraction will only get better as the restoration continues... with people once again able to go out on the boating lake in rowing boats and pedalos.\" The project received a \u00a31.7m National Lottery grant, with additional funding from the borough council, the government and the New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP). LEP chairman Doug Field said the reopening was \"great news\" for the town. \"Opening the Venetian Waterways will provide a welcome boost for Great Yarmouth's visitor economy as we head into the summer season,\" he said. \"Reviving this iconic feature will give new life to the seafront and support the creation of new jobs.\" The reopening will be marked by an Easter adventure trail and activities from 11:00 BST on Sunday.","381":"The bank, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), has announced that it will close 162 branches in England and Wales, affecting 792 jobs.

Priority is being given to at-risk and younger children, with P4-7 pupils facing the most disruption. A UK-wide shortage of the nasal spray Fluenz Tetra has meant health boards are receiving fewer vaccines than needed.\n\nHow many children have been affected?\n\nProgrammes started in Scotland in October to vaccinate against flu, which typically circulates in December, January and February. All Scottish primary schoolchildren are currently entitled to the vaccine, however some will see it pushed back.\n\nIt is difficult to tell how many children have been affected, but 12 out of 14 health boards in Scotland have reported delays so far. The health boards are following advice from the Scottish government to prioritise younger children aged two to five as well as five to 18-year-olds who have underlying health conditions.\n\nNHS Grampian estimated 163 schools had been affected by the delays, meaning approximately 27,000 pupils in the region could face disruption.\n\nNHS Lothian, NHS Dumfries & Galloway and NHS Shetland all confirmed they had faced some disruption to their flu programmes.\n\nNHS Highland said deliveries UK-wide were between two and four weeks behind schedule, meaning primary school vaccination sessions due to start on 11 and 18 November had been postponed.\n\nPupils in P3-7 from 28 schools in the NHS Borders region will also face similar delays of about two to four weeks, according to the health board.\n\nNHS Fife and NHS Forth Valley both said the schedule for children in P4-7 had been delayed due to the shortages.\n\nSome vaccine sessions at primary schools in Ayrshire and Arran due to begin on 18 November will be postponed, according to the health board.\n\nNHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde also confirmed there were supply issues, again leading to a delay in the school flu roll-out.\n\nThere has been minor disruption to the flu programme in Orkney and Shetland, according to NHS Orkney and N","383":"Mr. Ghani is expected to focus on fostering closer economic ties and will attend an international donor conference on Afghanistan hosted by Beijing. Several media outlets go out of their way to point out that Mr. Ghani has chosen China for his first state visit after taking office in less than a month. Afghanistan affairs analyst Shao Yuqun tells the Global Times' Chinese edition that the move underlines Beijing's \"significant importance for the war-torn country\". He adds that the size of China's economy and its \"positive image\" in the region make it the ideal candidate to help stabilise Afghanistan now that US and British forces have pulled out. In an article in the 21 Century Business Herald China's special envoy for Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi, is quoted as saying that Beijing's involvement in the country is \"mainly commercial\". But South Asian affairs analyst Zhao Gancheng dismisses what he says are Western accusations that China has its eye on Afghanistan's mineral resources as \"jealous criticism\". \"The West has no right to gossip about China's assistance and investment in Afghanistan,\" he argues in the the Chinese edition of the Global Times, since US and the Nato forces \"have caused massive civilian casualties, the collapse of the economy and social unrest in the country for the past 13 years\".

A test version of the kit will go on sale to developers shortly, followed by a public edition later this year. It will compete with Facebook's Oculus Rift and Sony's Morpheus VR headsets. The announcement marks a change of strategy for HTC, which has focused on smartphones. At a press conference in Barcelona on the eve of the Mobile World Congress trade show, the Taiwanese firm also unveiled a new flagship handset - the HTC One M9 - and a GPS-enabled fitness tracker Virtual gaming Only limited details of the Vive have been released ahead of a planned presentation by Valve at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. However, HTC has said that the headset features can display video at 90 frames per second (fps) - an important consideration as many developers believe a rate lower than 60fps can cause nausea. It includes two 1,200 by 1,080 pixel screens to provide high definition - but not 4K - quality graphics, and allows existing sets of headphones to be plugged into its side. HTC said that more than 70 sensors were built in to the machine, including a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a laser position sensor. It added that the machine also supported a facility developed by Valve that allows users to explore a virtual space and the objects within it from different angles - by moving about in real life within a 15ft by 15ft (4.6m squared) space. To do this, owners will also need to buy a Steam VR base station. \"It is rare that a company has an opportunity to forever transform the ways in which people interact with the world and communicate with each other,\" said Peter Chou, HTC's chief executive. Although gamers are set to be the most likely early adopters of the technology, HTC says it also has potential for other fields, such as healthcare, education and business.\n\nSummary Paragraph:\n\nHTC Vive will be paired with wireless controllers and tracking technology to let wearers explore computer-generated environments by walking round their rooms.

Prices rose 9.4% in England, 7.5% in Northern Ireland and 5.7% in Wales. The average house price in the UK was \u00a3273,000 in March. The number of mortgages for house sales in Scotland increased by about 50% between February and March this year. Homes costing more than \u00a3500,000 accounted for a \"significant proportion\" of the increase in sales. The price index for Scotland increased by 14.6% when compared to a year earlier due to a relatively small annual increase in Scotland prices of 0.8% in March 2014. The Land and Buildings Transaction Tax replaced UK stamp duty land tax in Scotland from 1 April 2015, which may have had an impact on the increase in prices.","386":"The annual ceremony recognizes films, television programs, and video games for their use of special effects. This year, the Visual Effects Society announced nominations for several movies, including Steven Spielberg's Tintin, Thor, Harry Potter, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. In 2011, Inception won four awards at the ceremony for its portrayal of dream landscapes. This year, Source Code, War Horse, and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows are all nominated for outstanding supporting visual effects. These films are considered special effects films, but they featured characters or environments created digitally. Television shows nominated include Pan Am, Breaking Bad, and Boardwalk Empire. A statement on their official website, the Visual Effects Society said special effects films have become \"critically important\" to the entertainment industry. They added that visual effects make contemporary movies box office hits in the same way that big name actors ensured the success of films in the past. There are specific categories at the ceremony for characters and environments created by special effects. Hogwarts school in Harry Potter and Heimdall's Observatory in Thor are both recognized as outstanding created environments this year. Animated characters nominated include Tintin, Ceaser from Rise of the Planet of the Apes, and Paul from the Simon Pegg film of the same name. Arthur Christmas, Puss In Boots, and Kung Fu Panda 2 are nominated for outstanding visual effects in an animated feature. A number of the films on the awards shortlist were shot in 3D, a format which has caused much debate within the film industry. Earlier this week, Steven Spielberg told Newsbeat that Tintin was \"the right film for 3D,\" but that he wouldn't want to shoot every film in the format. Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is nominated for outstanding visual effects in a live-action feature motion picture.

Guernsey's harbourmaster requested a report from Condor Ferries who had \"vessels in the vicinity\". The company said it was treating the matter \"extremely seriously\". Witnesses to what happened at about 18:00 BST described the swell as a \"colossal wave\" throwing people at the pools against railings in a \"split second\". Concern has been raised by the public over safety at the pools and the speed at which boats pass by. Condor Ferries said it hoped to have a preliminary outcome of its investigation later.","389":"Powerful trains have long barrelled down tracks blowing their horns. But faster lines mean louder trains. It is thought that around 4,860 homes in England will experience extra noise as a result of the proposed train line, according to a study by the Department for Transport. An estimated 10 properties will suffer from high noise levels and another 150 will need noise insulation. So just how loud will the proposed trains be? The government is yet to indicate the volume level, but according to the Telegraph, the Department for Transport has hired engineering firm Arup to demonstrate the noise to concerned members of the public. A simulation of the train's noise when it passes through various points can be heard through headphones at a series of roadshows. The simulated sound has been created by using a recording of the 217mph high-speed trains in France and then adjusting the sound to take into account Britain's potentially even faster trains. The government believes 250mph trains could be available by 2020. The recording is tweaked to take into account the ambient sounds from various locations along the route. Despite an absence of official numbers, the chairwoman of the Stop HS2 group, Lizzy Williams, estimates at 50m from the track, the noise from the trains will be \"between 95 and 97 decibels every two minutes if the line runs at capacity\". But speed isn't the only determinant of train noise. How bothersome the noise is depends on the pitch and the quality of the sound, says Royal Academy of Engineering network rail research professor Roderick Smith. \"A freight train on a poorly maintained track will create a lot more noise for a longer time,\" he explains. In Germany, residents have long been used to hearing high-speed Deutsche Bahn trains. \"We don't see very many complaints when it comes to the noise of the high speed lines, but we see a number or complaints about the noise of the freight transport lines,\" a spokesman says. At 25m from the track the 85-decibel noise of a train can be comparable to the noise of a jackhammer.","390":"The article talks about the growth of the Northern Ireland economy in 2019. According to the Economic Statistic Centre of Excellence (ESCoE), the economy in Northern Ireland grew by 0.9% in 2019, marginally higher than the 0.9% achieved in 2018. ESCoE uses official data to produce estimates of regional economic growth in the UK. Its work suggests that London's economy was again the fastest growing, with output expanding by 3.3%. The average growth rate for the UK as a whole was 1.4%. The East and West Midlands, Wales and the South West all had lower growth rates than Northern Ireland.\n\nThe article also mentions that the Northern Ireland economy is affected by Brexit, as the region has a higher proportion of its trade with the EU than any other part of the UK. There is also a high level of business confidence in the region, with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry reporting that more than 60% of businesses in the region are confident about future growth prospects.","391":"The Trump administration is expected to outline more of its thinking on tax reform this week, after making the idea a cornerstone of its election campaign. Tax reform has winners and losers, and often the losers feel the pain in a very specific concentrated way, the losers are more diffuse and that makes it easier for the losers to organize, according to former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to President Obama. President Trump made tax reform a cornerstone of his economic policy during his election campaign, and has continued to stress its importance amid the administrative chaos and apparent policy failures of his presidency so far. The idea of changing the complicated US taxation system, for both companies and people, has been bandied about for many years. The last substantial change was 30 years ago, indicating how hard it was to achieve. There are two broad conceptions of what \"reform\" actually means, and that it was still not clear to which one the president was referring. Taking away a lot of loopholes and a lot of inefficient parts of the US tax code and lowering the overall tax rate would benefit the United States, especially US companies. The second idea of tax cuts, he explained, involved believing in shrinking the size of the government and changing the distribution.","392":"Rodney King, the unarmed African-American man who became a symbol of the tensions between the police and minority groups, was laid to rest at a funeral service in Hollywood on Saturday. At the service, King was praised for showing no bitterness to the officers who beat him in 1991. The officers involved in the beating were acquitted the following year, sparking clashes in which 50 died. King was found dead at the bottom of a swimming pool last month at the age of 47. There was no sign of foul play. 'Symbol of forgiveness' The funeral service was held at Los Angeles' Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills on Saturday. \"People should not be judged by the mistakes that they make, but by how they rise above them,\" Rev Al Sharpton said. \"Rodney had risen above his mistakes. He never mocked anyone - not the police, not the justice system, not anyone.\" Mr King's famous words during the riots \"Can we all get along?\" were embroidered on the lid of the coffin, next to his portrait. \"He became a symbol of forgiveness,\" Rev Sharpton said. A number of donors helped to pay for the funeral. LAPD racism Rodney King's beating at the hands of the police, which left him with brain damage, was filmed by a bystander and shown by media outlets across the world. He had been stopped for speeding on a dark street on 3 March 1991. The four LA police officers who pulled him over hit him more than 50 times with their batons, kicked him and shot him with stun guns. The iconic images of his beating had a huge impact at the time on an already tense Los Angeles. Eventually, the whole chain of events had a profound impact on the way race was dealt with in the US. King recently told the Los Angeles Times that while he had come to terms with his broader legacy, dealing with the past had not been easy. \"Some people feel like I'm some kind of hero,\" he said. \"Others hate me. They say I deserved it. Other people, I can hear them mocking me for when I called for an end to the destruction, like I'm a fool for believing in peace.\" A later trial resulted in two of the four officers being jailed. King sued the City of Los Angeles and won $","393":"The \u00a326m warehouse in Swindon, which covers 13 acres and has 153 miles of shelving, is now home to many of the libraries\u2019 lesser-used editions.

Scientists also found that there was a huge difference in how long it took the tablets to release MDMA into the body. \"Fast releasing\" tablets released 95% of their MDMA within 30 minutes, while slower ones took 100 minutes - which they warned increased the likelihood of someone taking a second dose before the effects of the first were fully experienced. Drug analyst Trevor Shine says his team were \"surprised\" at the \"huge\" difference in MDMA levels between pills, as well as the difference in disintegration rates. He says this study shows that MDMA affects people differently, and that it's impossible to predict what varying amounts will do. The team say the \"vast majority of people using MDMA do not come to harm, but there is at present no way to predict, determine or prevent who will.\" \"I suspect many\/most users will still view it as something that happens to others, not them,\" Trevor tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Experts say there's been a \"resurgence in use of MDMA in Europe\" as well as an increase in strength. \"Our research clearly demonstrates that taking MDMA is a far more risky activity than perhaps thought,\" says Dr Lewis Couchman from St George's. \"It is prone to unpredictable dosing with toxic effects and potentially lethal consequences, of which users and drug workers need to be aware and should be warned.\" When someone takes MDMA, it gets absorbed into their blood stream and hits their brain, causing it to release a whole bunch of chemicals, mainly serotonin but also things called noradrenal","395":"John Bacon, former Blue Peter host, has recovered from pneumonia.

To get people motivated, the governor of Sirdaryo region has announced that prizes will be given to those who pick the most cotton.\n\nThe rewards include free televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines for those who pick five, ten, and fifteen tons of cotton, respectively. In addition, people who pick 15 tons of cotton will be allowed to bypass the long waiting list for a locally made car.\n\nBuying a new car can be a lengthy process in Uzbekistan, with waiting lists of up to six months and deposits as high as 85% for some Chevrolet models, which are made in the country. Second-hand cars can be bought more easily at markets, but many people prefer a new set of wheels.\n\nWhile Sirdaryo is dangling a carrot, Uzbekistan's interim President Shavkat Mirziyoyev seems to have opted for the stick. According to US-backed Radio Ozodlik, he's threatened to jail farmers who don't meet their cotton-picking targets.\n\nUzbekistan's annual cotton harvest is not only carried out by agricultural labourers - public sectors workers including teachers and medical professionals are all expected to join in.

Her account has now been made private. The actress has two Olivier awards for her stage roles in Legally Blonde and Flare Path, was made an OBE last year and has described the part of Fanny as her \"dream role\". The production of Funny Girl transferred to the Savoy Theatre in April after a successful run at the Menier Chocolate Factory. Smith had to pull out of two performances during that run after her father became unwell.

Women were disproportionately affected by these \"disgusting and totally unacceptable\" incidents, it said. Leadership rival Owen Smith has accused Mr Corbyn of not doing enough to clamp down on \"intolerance and misogyny\". Mr Corbyn has condemned harassment. The MPs' letter said: \"Rape threats, death threats, smashed cars and bricks through windows are disgusting and totally unacceptable in any situation. \"This is acknowledged by all factions yet the simple words of condemnation offered in response are inadequate. We expect swift and tangible action against those who commit such acts. \"We understand that the leadership does not have total control over those who choose to threaten and abuse others but that does not mean that more cannot be done to safeguard our female colleagues.\" It continues: \"We have also been alarmed to learn that our shadow chancellor and other members of the shadow cabinet have addressed rallies and events in which demonstrations outside MPs' offices and bullying at CLP meetings have been either actively encouraged or quietly condoned.\" The letter asks Mr Corbyn to make three pledges including \"an unequivocal statement declaring his support for all MPs, particularly women, and clearly condemning campaigning outside MPs' offices, surgeries etc\". It finishes: \"Jeremy, this is being done in your name.\" 'Permissive environment' Unite trade union leader Len McCluskey has, meanwhile, suggested in an interview with the Guardian, that the security services could be behind the abuse and intimidation of MPs on social media.

One of the most significant events to take place was Michael Cohen's plea deal in November, which indicated where the special counsel's office is focusing its efforts. The author also states that Cohen's testimony to Congress in February gave additional clues. The article then lists five potential lines of inquiry that the special counsel may be pursuing and why.\n\nThe author begins by discussing the Trump Tower meeting, which took place on June 9th, 2016. This meeting was between a Russian team lead by lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner - three of the top members of the Trump campaign. The meeting has been a point of interest in the special counsel's larger investigation into possible co-operation or co-ordination between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. The author then states that Mr Mueller reportedly learned about the meeting at the same time as the rest of America, but that it's now clearly a point of interest in the special counsel's larger investigation. The author also states that the special counsel's office asked the president about whether he had advance knowledge of the meeting in written questions that Mr Trump answered last week. The president supposedly denied any prior knowledge of the Trump Tower get-together, which was presented to his son as both part of an effort by the Russian government to help the Trump campaign and an opportunity to gain \"incriminating information\" about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. If the Trump Tower meeting is evidence of the Trump campaign team's interest in gaining information from Russia, the big question becomes what - if anything - happened next.\n\nThe author then discusses the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which took place between a Russian team lead by lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner - three of the top members of the Trump campaign.

The park includes mounds to represent the boats that the army used to cross the River Severn, as well as wooden pikes and cannons. Tibbut believes that the park is more than just a play area, as it also provides a history lesson to visitors. The only memorial on the battlefield is a plaque at Powick Bridge, which was defended by the army of King Charles II. The Battle of Worcester Society is commemorating the 360th anniversary of the battle with a week of events in September, including two re-enactments.\n\n##### Do you need a similar assignment done for you from scratch?

The council made this decision as part of a package of savings for the 2019-20 budget in order to allocate more money to children's services and adult social care. Citizens Advice staff and volunteers held a protest outside the council's headquarters to voice their opposition to the funding cut. The council agreed to phase out the funding over a two-year period, saving the council \u00a3370,000 over two years. The article also mentions that more than 6,000 people signed a petition in an attempt to save the grant, but the council was determined to move forward with the decision. Nicky Wilshere, chief officer at Ipswich Citizens Advice, expressed concern about the impact of the funding cut on their ability to provide essential services to their clients. Janet John, chief executive at the North East Suffolk branch, also voiced concern about the impact of the funding cut on rural areas where people may have limited access to other services. However, Councillor Richard Rout said he was confident that Citizens Advice could mitigate the funding cut through looking at their structure, outside funding, and premises costs.

The victim suffered a fractured skull and bruising to the brain and developed behavioural difficulties, Carlisle Crown Court heard. Lancaster was jailed for 27 months after admitting causing grievous bodily harm. 'Dreadful injuries' The court heard Lancaster, of Stanley Road, Brampton, had \"resentment\" towards the other man who had chosen to be friends with the defendant's ex-partner and not him. Lancaster grabbed the man by the neck and pushed him against a fence before removing rings and punching him once. Only after constant vomiting the following day did the seriousness of the man's injuries become apparent. Karen Tunnacliffe, defending, said: \"There was no intent to cause the dreadful injuries.\" Judge Peter Davis said it was hoped the victim would make a full recovery in time.

This is part of a \u00a3800m project to get the station ready for longer trains and provide space for 30% extra passengers during the busiest times of the day. Network Rail had warned stations like Vauxhall and Wimbledon would be \"exceptionally busy\" while several others in south-west London are shut. However, passengers appear to have heeded warnings and avoided services. An average of 270,000 journeys are usually made to and from Waterloo each day.\n\nThe signal failure at about 09:30 which affected three platforms caused delays to trains in and out of the station. Closed and part-closed stations: BBC Radio London reporter Barry Caffrey said both Wimbledon and Clapham Junction stations were \"quiet\" during the rush hour and there were none of the expected queues. He added that passengers he had spoken to at Waterloo had been \"pleasantly surprised\" by their morning commute. Stations elsewhere on the network were also quieter than normal. Winchester station was described as a \"ghost town\" while passengers at Esher station, who had been told to expect lengthy queues, instead found empty platforms. About 1,000 workers are taking part in the upgrade work. When the works began on Saturday, services were also hit by a signal failure. Network Rail CEO Mark Carne apologised for the disruption to trains but said there was \"no other way to do this\". \"There will be three weeks of disruption but decades of fantastically improved services,\" he said.

The article focuses on the performance of Robert Redford, who is the only cast member in the film. Redford's character, known as Our Man, faces high seas and violent storms with an almost silent stoicism. The film's only real spoken lines come in a voiceover at the start when Redford's character reads out a valedictory letter to his family and friends. Chandor made his name with 2011's talky financial crisis drama Margin Call, a debut feature that earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Chandor was inspired to write the film's opening letter on a train journey along the US coast, while he was hard at work editing Margin Call. Chandor had the idea of casting Redford for All is Lost while at Redford's annual Sundance Film Festival in Utah. During Redford's welcoming speech, a technical hitch meant that a speaker close to Chandor stopped working and robbed the actor of his voice. \"I was struck by the contrast,\" says Chandor. \"Here was this guy across the room I could barely hear.

The earthquake, which was measured at 7.5 on the Richter scale, caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city. The tsunami waves that followed reached up to 3 meters high, causing further damage and displacing thousands of people. The aftershocks continued to rock the city, making it difficult for rescue teams to access the affected areas.\n\nThe government has responded quickly to the disaster, deploying relief aid and rescue teams to help the victims.

He quickly clarified that the tweet was a joke, and the sculptures were \"exquisite\". The other tweets appear to be making fun of the people of the state and another of its famous temples. Multiple charges But Mr Iyer-Mitra has been slapped with a bewildering array of charges for his \"crimes\". He's been accused of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and race in a place of worship, insulting religious feelings and creating \"public nuisance\". He has been charged with an \"obscene act in a public place\". A protection of ancient monument law has been invoked to charge him with misuse of the Konark temple where he recorded his video. And the information and technology law has been dredged up to charge him with sending offensive messages. As if all this was not enough, Mr Iyer-Mitra has also been accused of defamation under a controversial colonial-era law. At least two of the charges are non-bailable and, if found guilty, he could spend five years in prison. Mr Iyer-Mitra has apologised unreservedly - \"I beg apology because of my stupidity,\" he said - to Orissa's lawmakers. Despite that, police have pressed on with the charges and a lower court has refused to grant him bail, saying he could intimidate witnesses.","424":"The case of Hamzah Khan, a baby who died in 2011, has prompted the NSPCC to call on health officials to raise a red flag when children miss key appointments so that other youngsters do not \"slip off the radar of society\". The NSPCC said that Hamzah \"became invisible\" on leaving hospital after he was born. After his birth on 17 June 2005, he was seen by a midwife a week later and a health visitor a fortnight after that - but that appointment was the last time he was seen by a health professional. He missed a series of appointments at hospital, with health visitors and GPs and he did not receive routine immunisations. Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said: \"Tragically, Hamzah became invisible, slipping off the radar of our entire society the moment he left hospital after birth. \"His mother made no attempt to register his birth; he missed midwife appointments, health visitor checks, immunisations; and he was never registered for school. \"A red flag must be raised when key appointments are missed so that children cannot disappear. \"It cannot be right that the first time someone took serious steps to track him down was six years after his birth, by which time he was already dead.\" The NSPCC's head of policy, David Tucker, said: \"I have never heard before in any serious case review of a child being so completely lost. \"He had dropped completely off the radar. \"I wouldn't want to say that just because this is the only such case we know of that there are not others. \"The potential for other children to be missing off the radar does seem to still be there.\" Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive at charity Action for Children, said: \"Children at risk of dying at the hands of their parents are crying out for help but they aren't being heard. \"More support for professionals who work with neglected children is vital; they must be allowed to trust their instincts and escalate their concerns. \"Social workers, teachers and police officers have told us about","425":"Firefighters quickly put out the blaze in Scarborough Drive in Breadsall, Derby, just before 02:00 BST.

There has been a rise in the number of attacks on engineers and in one case razor blades were hidden behind anti-5G posters on telegraph poles.

European markets had opened higher but were were further boosted after China's central bank announced it was cutting interest rates. That followed two days of turmoil on China's stock markets. On Tuesday, the main Shanghai Composite index closed down 7.6% at 2,964.97 points, extending Monday's losses. Stock markets in Lisbon, Madrid and Milan, all also made strong gains. But Wall Street bucked the trend. Having initially surged all three main stock indexes in the US reversed sharply in the final hour of trading. The Dow Jones index eventually closed 1.3% lower, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.4%. \"Today's move to cut interest rates... is certainly a step in the right direction,\" said Anna Stupnytska, global economist at Fidelity Worldwide Investment. \"But while this might help sentiment, it is not enough to reverse the ongoing slowdown in China's growth. Some stabilisation in activity is probably the best case scenario. A sharp rebound is unlikely,\" she added. The volatile market moves have raised speculation that the Bank of England may delay an interest rate rise. However, Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Although the UK has clearly been caught up in the recent meltdown in global financial markets, we doubt that it will knock the economic recovery off course. \"That said, it provides the more cautious members of the [Monetary Policy Committee] with another reason to hold fire on voting to raise interest rates.\"","427":"The article is about a group of 15 migrants who were found in the back of a refrigerated lorry on the Spirit of France at the port of Dover.

He fought some of the great names of boxing during a three-decade career. They included Oscar de la Hoya, Sugar Ray Leonard and Felix Trinidad. Camacho was being treated at the Rio Piedras medical centre in San Juan. The centre's director Ernesto Torres told reporters that the former boxer went into cardiac arrest in the early hours of Saturday morning, was taken off life support and died shortly after. Earlier Camacho's mother Maria Matias said she wanted doctors to remove her son from life support. His eldest son, Hector Jr, had indicated he wanted to keep his father alive, but his mother had the final say. Flamboyant Camacho was shot in the head on Tuesday while sitting in a car outside a bar in his home city of Bayamon, outside the capital San Juan. His friend Adrian Mojica Moreno was killed in the attack. Police said the car contained bags of cocaine at the time of the shooting, but said they did not know of any motives behind the attack. Camacho was known for his flamboyant style and skill in the ring. He was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in New York where he made his professional debut in 1980. He went on to win four world titles across three weight divisions, beginning with the WBC super featherweight title in 1983. His last fight was an attempted comeback against Saul Duran in 2010, which he lost. By then he had become known for his troubled personal life and run-ins with the police. Camacho was sentenced to seven years in prison for burglary in 2007, though the sentence was later suspended. He was found in possession of drugs and was the subject of a restraining order brought by his ex-wife, who complained of domestic abuse. At the time of his death he held a career record of 79 wins, 6 losses and three draws, with 38 knockouts.","429":"Backers of the scheme are aiming to buy the old farmers' co-op and surrounding buildings. They plan to use some of the land to create cheap parking for up to 100 cars to boost High Street traders. They also hope to develop a community shop on the site to promote local goods and produce. Cymdeithas Cynnal a Cefnogi Cefn Gwlad, which translates as the Society to Sustain and Support the Rural Countryside, is aiming to issue 900 shares at \u00a3500 each.

Phase two involves opening a community shop to showcase locally made goods and produce.

He feared it could mean a long delay or that Brexit \"may never happen at all\" and said the UK must be prepared to walk away without a deal. The PM said she was focused on leaving the EU with a deal on 29 March. Mr Eustice is a longstanding Brexiteer, who stood as a UKIP MEP candidate before joining the Conservatives. He told the BBC he would back the withdrawal deal the prime minister has negotiated with the EU, despite some reservations. \"I do think it's preferable to have an orderly Brexit and crucially, it's preferable to get Brexit done,\" he said. \"We have to get legally out of the European Union as quickly as possible within this window. If we don't and we end up with a long delay of two years, as some would like, then I really do fear we will be in a disastrous situation and Brexit may never happen at all.\" Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who himself quit the government in November, suggested any delay to Brexit would reward the EU for its \"intransigence\" and reduce the chances of getting a deal. \"The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now?\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. \"I think from the EU's point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off and that's the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment.\" Mr Eustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall, is the 14th member of Theresa May's government to resign over Brexit and said he was doing so with \"tremendous sadness\". But in his resignation letter, he said he feared that the EU would end up \"dictating the terms of any extension requested and the final humiliation of our country\".

The first dose was administered on January 21, and the second on January 23. Graham contacted the emergency services after his mother received the vaccine at her home, and a paramedic informed him that they had never heard of anyone receiving two doses of the vaccine within such a short period of time. The governing body member for NHS Kernow in Cornwall apologized to the family for the incident, and the NHS is investigating what happened. Rob White, the clinical lead for the Covid-19 vaccination program in Cornwall, explained that receiving two doses of the vaccine in a short period of time \"will not cause the patient any harm,\" and that Barbara Wright will be protected from the virus with the two doses she received. Graham Wright shared the story to prevent it from happening to anyone else. The UK's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, has stated that the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine will be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose. Two doses of the vaccine are necessary to provide the best protection against the virus. Chris Whitty explained that getting more people vaccinated with the first jab \"is much more preferable\" as it provides the \"great majority\" of initial protection. Graham Wright said a nurse and a doctor from the same practice had both injected his mother. A doctor from the practice apologized to him and blamed the mistake on a \"computer glitch,\" and Graham said he felt a medical practice blaming a glitch was \"not the answer.\" He said he felt \"sorry for the doctors\" and understood mistakes being made, but felt a medical practice blaming a glitch was \"not the answer.\" Graham Wright was concerned about the incident and hoped that NHS Kernow would take action to prevent it from happening again.

He cites data from 20 areas in England and Wales, which shows that types of properties for rent also vary in size. The average London one-bed flat for rent measures 51 sq m, while in rural Shropshire and mid Wales, the average is 77 sq m. The amount of space you get for your rent is reflected in the space you get for your money when buying. The Office for National Statistics said 1 sq m of floor space - about the size of a red phone box - costs \u00a319,439 in Kensington and Chelsea, while in Blaenau Gwent the same amount of space costs \u00a3777. The author also mentions Ed Stennett, an app designer who moved to central London from Winchester and struggled to find a flat for his \u00a31,000 a month rent. He cites Sam Hurst, spokesman for OpenRent, who says that despite cities like Oxford, Bristol and London being hugely expensive in terms of monthly rents, the properties afforded by those rents are simply not there.

The organization said 221 pools were council-run, with the North West being particularly hard hit, affecting about half a million swimmers. Councils pointed to financial difficulties in their decision making. With lockdown in England having come to an end, gyms and swimming pools across the country are allowed to reopen from Wednesday, regardless of what tier their area is in. While it's extremely positive that millions of swimmers up and down the country can return to the activity they love, it's unacceptable to even think that so many people or clubs will not have a much-loved swimming pool to visit,\" Swim England's chief executive Jane Nickerson said. She said more investment was needed to keep swimming pools and leisure centres open, adding despite a government grant for the industry \"financial pressures have not gone away\". Four times world champion triathlete Barbara Holmes, from Lancashire, said: \"People need their pools, especially the children.\" Ms Holmes, who is the over-60s world champion, has been backing campaigners trying to reopen Fleetwood swimming pool. \"The community needs to be heard,\" she said. Trafford Leisure said all of its centres would remain closed until the new year, saying they would be \"largely empty and costly to run\". To save money, its chief operating officer said it had had to furlough staff as well as leaving its pool and building unheated. In Stoke-on-Trent, the council said it recognised the \"essential\" physical and mental health benefits of leisure facilities but had made the decision to stagger their reopening and only two of the city's gyms would not remain closed. Council leader Abi Brown said 75% of its leisure centre staff had been \"redeployed to critical services including welfare calls and contact tracing\" in an effort to bring down coronavirus cases and some centres had been adapted for community testing. \"If the council has to close leisure centres it will make it even more difficult to break the chain of transmission and bring down infection rates,\" she said. \"We don't want to be in this position at all and it's not a decision we have taken lightly.

The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office in Atlanta released an initial statement ahead of the full post-mortem report - eight months after her death. A judge in Atlanta issued an order on Thursday to unseal the report, following requests from the media. The medical examiner's office said it reviewed medical records, investigative files and other documents to determine how Brown died. The exam concluded cannabis and alcohol were involved in her death, along with medication used for sedation or to treat anxiety, citing the \"underlying cause\" of death as \"immersion associated with drug intoxication\". The statement said: \"Death was clearly not due to natural causes, but the medical examiner has not been able to determine whether death was due to intentional or accidental causes, and has therefore classified the manner of death as undetermined.'' The state reportedly requested the post-mortem documents originally be sealed in September 2015 in order to protect an ongoing investigation into Brown's death. Media lawyers argued the sealing order should be lifted because it was made without a public hearing, in violation of the long-standing rules that post-mortem results are public records. \"We would hope that news agencies and the media receiving the report would do so with the discretion and dignity a family who has lost a loved one deserves,\" said district attorney Paul Howard, who argued for the sealing of the report last year. \"Our investigation into the death of Bobbi Kristina Brown will continue.\" Brown was the only child of singer Whitney Houston; her father was R&B singer Bobby Brown. She was buried in August at the Fairview cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey, next to her mother, who drowned in a bath in 2012 on the eve of the Grammy Awards ceremony.","441":"Inmates in a Brazilian prison died after a riot broke out. The prison director said the clash was set off by the transfer of the leader of a criminal gang to the jail, which is controlled by a rival gang. About 100 visitors were taken hostage and later freed. Police said they had regained control of both jails. Brazil has the world's fourth largest prison population, with more than 620,000 inmates. The PCC is a powerful criminal gang first established in a Sao Paulo prison in 1993. It has since expanded to become a powerful organisation which engages in drug trafficking far beyond the prison walls. Its members frequently clash with those of the Comando Vermelho, a gang originally founded in Rio de Janeiro. Many of the most powerful gang leaders, with reputations for violence and brutality, are often moved from jails far away from their home states but they are still able to run their criminal network from inside prison.\n\n## Free access for EU citizens and subscribers to CaffiNews\n\nCaffiNews allows EU citizens and subscribers to read for free all news and articles related to Italian news and politics.

The council has confirmed that no listed building consent was obtained for the work on the mural, and that it is investigating a potential criminal offense. The holes drilled in the wall around the mural could be seen as a contravention of the regulations. After the holes appeared, businessman Hekmat Kaveh offered funds to buy the house and ensure the mural stays in the town. Campaigners have been working to reverse a plan to remove and sell the mural by raising up to \u00a31m to buy the building and the graffiti on it. A professional art conservator has visited the mural and said it could be saved but might take months to restore. The council has said it is probing \"substantial work\" carried out on the listed building where the 'Spy Booth' artwork appeared in April. Days ago vandals attacked the wall for a second time, with large drill holes appearing around the mural. The council said it was investigating a potential criminal offence. \"Evidence is being gathered and investigations continue\" said the council, which earlier confirmed no listed building consent had been sought for the house. Listed building consent is required from the local authority, before any work is done to the fabric of a listed property. The holes drilled in the wall around the mural could be seen a contravention of the regulations. Gloucestershire Police said its officers were present when council officials went into the house but \"purely from a public safety perspective\" to ensure there was \"no breach of the peace in the area\". Restoration hope After the holes appeared, businessman Hekmat Kaveh - who has offered funds to buy the house to ensure the mural stays in the town - said he thought an attempt was being made to remove it. Since the end of June campaigners have been working to reverse a plan to remove and sell the mural by raising up to \u00a31m to buy the building and the graffiti on it. The GCHQ-themed mural remains covered in silver and red graffiti, after it was vandalised two weeks ago.

The college has said that a full structural review will take place, but that there have already been improvements in attendance rates and tracking of student progress. The FEC has said that the college and board need to put in place sufficiently skilled and experienced quality improvement personnel to ensure that there is not a further repeat of an inadequate judgement when the college is next inspected. The college has said that a consultation process will take place, and that a recommendation will be made to the government and to the college board between Easter and early summer.","448":"The US would be \u201cprepared to work with North Korea to achieve prosperity on the par with our South Korean friends\u201d, he told reporters on Friday. Mr Pompeo, who has just returned from Pyongyang, said he had \u201cgood\u201d talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Kim and President Donald Trump will meet in Singapore on 12 June. The two leaders, who had previously exchanged insults and threats, made the announcement after landmark talks between North and South Korea in April. What did Mr Pompeo say? \u201cIf chairman Kim chooses the right path, there is a future brimming with peace and prosperity for the North Korean people,\u201d he said after Friday\u2019s talks in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha. Mr Pompeo urged Pyongyang to take \u201cbold action to quickly denuclearise\u201d. But he stressed that this would require a \u201crobust verification\u201d programme by the US and other nations. During his surprise visit to North Korea this week, Pyongyang released three US detainees. How do North and South Korean economies compare? Daily life in the two countries couldn\u2019t be more different. After the end of the Korean war in 1953 the South, an ally of the US, embraced a capitalist philosophy. It has developed into one of Asia\u2019s most affluent nations. A government-sponsored industrial push in the 1960s led to huge corporations like Samsung and Hyundai being created. Key figures: South Korea is one of the world\u2019s top 20 economies, with GDP of $1.4tn (\u00a31tn). By contrast, North Korea\u2019s GDP is less than $20bn, placing it well outside the top 100 economies. It has a communist system, but capitalism is creeping into the country. There are things to buy \u2013 but only for some people, those who have money. The majority of people in North Korea live in poverty. Kim Jong-un has made clear that development is a priority.","449":"In this article, the authors discuss the case of Mansur Mohamed Surur, who was part of an international conspiracy responsible for the slaughter of more than 100 elephants and dozens of rhinos. The prosecutors in New York say it amounted to an estimated $7.4m (\u00a35.4m) amassed over seven years. Some exports were hidden inside \"pieces of art such as African masks and statues\", and money was paid to and from foreign customers by \"international wire transfers, some which were sent through US financial institutions\", according to court documents. Mr Surur was arrested last year in the Kenyan city of Mombasa and extradited to the US to face trial in New York. He also faces charges of money laundering and drug dealing. He and three others - Amara Cherif from Guinea, Moazu Kromah of Liberia, and Abdi Hussein Ahmed of Kenya - are accused of agreeing illegal ivory sales with buyers in Manhattan, as well as others in south-east Asia. They are all now in the US except Mr Ahmed who \"remains a fugitive\", the US Department of Justice says. Phone calls and messages in which three of the four men allegedly discuss pricing and payment methods with a customer are cited in court documents. It is alleged that their network was based in Uganda but involved other countries - among them the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Senegal, and Tanzania. Around $1.1m (\u00a3820,000) of proceeds from the sales were laundered, prosecutors say.\n\nThe case of Mansur Mohamed Surur is a reminder of the seriousness of wildlife crime and the need for international cooperation in combating it. The extradition of Mr Surur to the US to face trial is a significant step forward in the fight against wildlife crime. It is hoped that his conviction will serve as a deterrent to others involved in the illegal ivory trade. The case also highlights the importance of international cooperation in combating wildlife crime. The involvement of countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Mozambique, Senegal, and Tanzania in the illegal ivory trade is a reminder of the global nature of the problem. It is therefore essential that countries work together to tackle the problem at its source","450":"The article discusses the work of charities in Bedford and their response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nKey Points:\n- Charities in Bedford have been working hard to help feed as many people as possible during the pandemic.\n- The demand for food has increased significantly, with charities like Food4 handing out more than five times the amount of food they did in 2019.\n- Food4 has handled over 100 tonnes of food in the last year, which would have otherwise been destined for landfill.\n- The pandemic has been a steep learning curve for charities, who have had to adapt to new ways of working and increased demand.\n- Charities in Bedford have formed strong relationships with each other and with statutory authorities to provide the best possible support to their clients.\n- The generosity of the public has been at an all-time high, with donations of food and financial support helping charities to continue their work.\n- The way charities are working together has been amazing, and has helped to ensure that those in need are receiving the support they need.\n- There is no surprise that charities have been busy, and they have been able to refer their clients to other support they may need.\n- The pandemic has been challenging for charities, but they have been able to adapt and continue to provide essential support to their communities.","451":"The family members of BSkyB sales boss Nick Milligan were involved in a tragic accident on Sunday in the Camel Estuary, off Padstow, in Cornwall.

I was surprised by the question, not so much because of the question itself but because of the timing of it. It is not a very common question, but a middle class person usually asks it to know about a person's status. I was more surprised because it is quite unusual for a person to ask a question like this at the beginning of a conversation. It was unusual and it revealed more about the one asking the question than what a person answers. I am suspicious because Sacha Baron Cohen is a smart man who would not ask such a question without a reason. I was more surprised by the fact that Sacha Baron Cohen is giving an interview in his own person. He had not given an interview to a British broadcaster before in his own person. It was unusual for him to give an interview to a British broadcaster. This is because he was famous for giving interviews in his different characters: Ali G, Borat, Bruno, and General Admiral Aladeen in The Dictator. His new movie was already successful because it had received some decent reviews and was already doing well in advance box office. His interview was offered to me at short notice. I agreed to the interview, but I was very anxious. I was anxious because Sacha Baron Cohen is famous for setting people up. He has a small entourage. It was unusual for the people in the entourage to behave like security guards. They were, in fact, his PR guys. There were three men in his writers group who were also in the entourage.

The Trump administration has blamed China for backpedaling on trade agreements and has accused the country of backtracking on important elements of what the parties had agreed to. China, on the other hand, has released a paper that blames the US for the setback in trade talks. The paper sets out China's position in trade talks including some of its prerequisites for a deal. It states that the US should remove all additional tariffs imposed on Chinese exports and that both sides should work together to reach a \"mutually beneficial and win-win agreement\". The paper also stresses the importance of mutual respect and the right to development. While the US has wanted to keep tariffs in place as part of the enforcement mechanism, China has opposed this.

He was born in east London in 1935 and joined Doctor Who towards the end of Patrick Troughton's tenure as the programme's second Doctor. One of his best-loved episodes was 1983's The Five Doctors, the BBC show's 20th anniversary special. Dicks also wrote numerous episodes of Doctor Who, including The Deadly Assassin, The Ark in Space, and Genesis of the Daleks. He was known for his ability to create suspense and tension in his stories and for his attention to detail. Dicks was also a prolific novelist, writing many Doctor Who novelisations for the Target Books imprint. He was a member of the Doctor Who writing family and was responsible for some of the show's greatest moments and iconic creations. His stories were some of the most influential of the original classic series. His first credited script for the show was 1969's The War Games with Patrick Troughton. Producer Derrick Sherwin had suggested the concept that the Doctor came from a race called the Time Lords. The War Games script included the line \"Exterminate!\" which became a catchphrase for the Daleks.

On Sunday, Chinese authorities announced Mr Liu was under investigation for \u201cserious disciplinary violations\u201d. Mr Liu has also been fired from his position as the deputy head of China\u2019s central National Development and Reform Commission.\n\nLast December, Caijing, the respected business magazine where Luo Changping, 32, serves as deputy editor, published an article accusing Liu Tienan\u2019s wife and son of illegal business dealings. The article did not mention Mr Liu by name. Instead, it simply stated he was a high-ranking official with the national economic planning committee.\n\nThe investigative journalist, Luo Changping, was not so reserved. In three hard-hitting posts on weibo, China\u2019s equivalent of Twitter, Mr Luo argued Liu Tienan and his family had enriched themselves by obtaining illegal loans from Chinese banks. Mr Liu was also accused of lying about his education and issuing death threats to his former mistress.\n\nThen, for months, both Mr Luo and the Chinese media fell silent on the topic. That is, until China\u2019s anti-corruption agency announced it was investigating Liu Tienan. After that, the floodgates opened. The Chinese media published reports on Liu Tienan\u2019s investigation and Mr Luo\u2019s own newspaper, Caijing, reposted his allegations on Caijing\u2019s weibo account.\n\nSo, do Chinese journalists now have the green light to target corrupt officials?

This will allow him to be tried in court for the actions he took as interior minister. Matteo Salvini is accused of illegally keeping people on a boat off Sicily for days in August 2019. He has been charged with abuse of office. If successfully prosecuted at trial, he could face up to 15 years in jail. The trial is likely to be a long and drawn out process. Mr Salvini has repeatedly said he wants to go to court. He told the chamber he wanted \"to tell the world\" that his migration policies \"saved tens of thousands of lives.\" \"I am absolutely calm and proud of what I have done. And I'll do it again as soon as I get back into government,\" he said later. He also compared himself to US President Donald Trump, who was impeached in December and accused opponents of undermining his electoral success through the courts. \"I, like Trump? He has a few more billions and a few more years, but it's a bad little habit of the left, going around in the world, to try to win by judicial means,\" he wrote on Twitter. The response of most politicians when the hand of the judiciary comes knocking is to deny, evade, or flee. But for Matteo Salvini, it's a different story. The Italian populist has built his political success on a hard anti-migrant line, so the decision to try him for blocking migrants from Italy feeds the image he presents of himself as defender of the Italian nation. Salvini is likely to relish the opportunity to paint himself as a martyr. But the trial is likely to be a long and drawn out process. Salvini's popularity has dipped since his demotion from premier, and he will be hoping that by the time his trial concludes, his fortunes will have turned around.","458":"Snapchat and Facebook\u2019s Poke are apps for sending videos and photos that are automatically deleted once viewed.

The decision comes as the government is due to publish its White Paper on the future of the BBC on Thursday. The BBC said the plans meant a \u00a310m boost for \"fresh talent and innovative digital content for young audiences\". The new investment is on top of an existing \u00a3125m already tied to the second city base in The Mailbox, it said. Under the plans, the commissioning, publishing and some production of BBC Three's short-form content, along with the social media team that supports it, would relocate to Birmingham by 2018. The channel, which targets 16 to 34-year-olds with a mix of comedy, documentaries and current affairs, went online only in February, to save \u00a330m. It will also still be based in London. A new youth team will also be set up at The Mailbox site, which will be the main suppliers of news content for the channel's Daily Drop, BBC Three's new, mobile-first platform. The local newspaper partnerships - outlined in September by director general Tony Hall as a pool of local reporters who will share work with local papers - are expected to be based in Birmingham alongside the English Regions HQ. \"These teams, together with Birmingham's young and diverse demographic, will be harnessed to act as part of the hub for the identification, development and commissioning of new diverse talent and programmes as announced in the BBC's Diversity and Inclusion strategy last month,\" a spokesman said. \"To support this, the BBC Academy will launch a new scheme, the Birmingham Production Apprenticeship, for new off-air talent from diverse backgrounds.\" Lord Hall said Birmingham had benefited from recent extra investment, but there was more to do. \"Now we're putting Birmingham at the heart of our innovation with BBC Three and making it home to a new youth team for BBC News. \"The city's incredible diversity also means it's the perfect place to lead our work to ensure we have a better reflection of the UK on screen.\"","461":"The demand for rhino horn is at an all time high and South Africa, which has the largest reserves of the wild animal, is a prime hunting ground for poachers. Over the past three years, gangs are said to have killed more than 800 rhinos for their horns, which can fetch \u00a322,000 ($35,055) per kg on the black market. Poachers use a chainsaw to cut away the rhino's horns, after darting it with a tranquilizer - drugged and helpless the animal bleeds to death. Large syndicates are involved in this multi-billion dollar trade worldwide - exporting the horns from Africa to parts of Asia and the Middle-East. Despite many anti-poaching measures 310 have been killed in South Africa this year, more than 330 had been killed at the end of last year - and the numbers are set to increase, experts warn. In the five years up to 2005, an average of 36 rhinos were killed each year. Some say today's efforts are \"too conventional\" and are not enough. Now South Africa has commissioned a study into whether legalising trade in rhino horn could in fact help to bring down poaching, the Department of Environmental Affairs announced recently. \"We are impartial at this stage but we are looking at all the suggestions which could help us in the fight against poachers,\" the department's spokesperson, Albie Modise, told the BBC. \"We are awaiting submissions and would consider this if we get authentic scientific backing that this would be effective,\" he said. The idea is that legalising rhino horn trade would make South Africa directly responsible for meeting the demand for the horns - taking power out of the hands of poachers and placing it in the hands authorities who would also be sensitive to current conservation efforts. These authorities would do market research into global markets of the trade, said Mr Modise. The department says rhino horn stock piles could also be sold to fund further rhino conservation efforts.

The microbe, Microsporidia MB, was discovered by studying mosquitoes on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya. The researchers found that mosquitoes carrying the microbe were not harbouring the malaria parasite, and lab experiments confirmed that the microbe gave the mosquitoes protection against malaria.\n\nThe discovery is significant because malaria is a deadly disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, most of them children under the age of five. While progress has been made through the use of bed nets and spraying homes with insecticide, this has stalled in recent years. The article states that new tools are needed to tackle malaria, and this discovery could be a major breakthrough in the fight against the disease.\n\nThe article does not provide any specific information on how the microbe blocks malaria, but it states that the researchers are investigating whether they can release infected mosquitoes into the wild, or use spores to suppress the disease.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the significance of the discovery of a microbe that has the potential to control the spread of malaria and could be a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly disease.","464":"The Atlantic magazine report about US President Donald Trump's comments on fallen American soldiers has been corroborated independently by The Associated Press. The report has stirred up a storm in the country, with veterans' groups, progressive groups and ordinary people condemning Mr Trump's alleged remarks. The president has defended himself by comparing the accusations to those of colluding with Russia to win the 2016 presidential election. Veterans' groups are among those condemning Mr Trump, less than two months from the 2020 election. Progressive group VoteVets posted a video of families whose children had been killed in action. \"You don't know what it is to sacrifice,\" says one. Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America, tweeted: \"Who is really surprised by this?\" A small group of protesters waved placards at the president's motorcade on Saturday near the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. Mr Trump has often staked a claim to strong support among the military, and last year Pew Research Center found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief, with 57% in favour. Three-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. What is Trump reported to have said? According to The Atlantic, when Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside Paris in November 2018, 100 years after the end of World War One, he said it was \"filled with losers\". Four sources told the magazine he had rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as \"suckers\". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but a \"senior Defense Department official with first-hand knowledge of events\" and a \"senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump's comments\" confirmed the cemetery comments to AP. In 2018 the White House said the cemetery visit had been cancelled because bad weather had grounded the president's helicopter.","465":"Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson have tested positive for coronavirus.

The new frigates would be built across different shipyards, but assembled at a central site, and ready for service by 2023. The cost of each frigate would be capped at \u00a3250m. Harland and Wolff, a shipbuilding company in Belfast, has expressed interest in the project, saying it could bring its \"commercial edge\" to the plans. However, the company has not been part of any naval shipbuilding to date and has found it difficult to break into the industry. The Ministry of Defence has accepted recommendations from the former chief executive of Harland and Wolff about its strategy for building navy ships, which includes spreading the work about the UK's yards, including Belfast. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has described the plan as a \"huge opportunity\" for UK shipyards, which could bid for these \"big contracts\" next year. The navy currently uses Type-23 frigates, which would be slowly phased out, and would be replaced by eight Type-26 frigates, which are being built in Glasgow, and five of the smaller Type 31e frigates. However, some experts have questioned the feasibility of the plan to spread the work across different shipyards, citing logistical challenges and the need for a centralised approach to ensure quality and efficiency.\n\n# Answers\n\n### Comment by S.T.A.R. on 2021-02-22 11:04:40\n\nHere is my answer.\n\nThe government of the UK has declared a plan to build a new fleet of frigates to replace its present Type-23 frigates. The new frigates will be built across different shipyards but assembled at a central site, and ready for service by 2023. The cost of each frigate will be capped at 250 million pounds. Harland and Wolff, a shipbuilding company in Belfast, has expressed interest in the project, saying it could bring its \"commercial edge\" to the plans. However, the company has not been part of any naval shipbuilding to date and has found it difficult to break into the industry. The Ministry of Defence","468":"1.

This can make it easier for hackers to guess their passwords. There are several factors that affect the choices people make when picking a password. For example, men tend to choose passwords with more diversity while women prefer length. Another factor that affects password choices is the color of the website or service's logo. If the logo is red, people are more likely to choose a password with red in it. These facts have been revealed by looking at data from security breaches. The data shows that people are lousy at picking good passwords. In many cases, people use passwords that are linked to their personal information, such as their birthdays, wedding days, or the names of family members. This makes it easy for hackers to guess their passwords. To avoid this problem, people should choose passwords that are unrelated to their personal information.","477":"The changes to protect bus drivers on London buses were implemented by Transport for London (TfL) following concerns about the deaths of 26 bus workers due to Covid-19.

They claimed that he had misled voters over a leaked memo. In a TV interview, he had claimed that he had first heard about the memo when he received a phone call from a reporter. However, he had actually authorized his special advisor to leak the memo, an action that he admitted days after being elected.\n\nThe judges ruled that Mr Carmichael had told a \"blatant lie\" in the TV interview and had committed an illegal practice. However, they also ruled that it had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt that he had committed an illegal practice. Mr Carmichael was \"absolutely delighted\" with the decision to refuse the petition. He recognized that there had been a lapse in his conduct and described it as a \"highly politically-motivated\" case.\n\nTim Morrison, one of the petitioners, said they had won the argument but Mr Carmichael had won the case \"on a point of law\". He said that Mr Carmichael had been found by the court to have lied to his electorate. However, he also said that Mr Carmichael had won the case on a point of law.\n\nThe Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards confirmed that an inquiry into Mr Carmichael was ongoing.","495":"In the article, the writer presents the case of Martin Wilson, a 38-year-old man who attacked and stabbed a 43-year-old man named Stephen Riley in Barnsley, England, on June 26th, 2023. The attack resulted in Riley's death, and Wilson was subsequently convicted of murder. The writer provides details of the attack, including how Riley was found slumped over a garden wall and later died in the hospital. The writer also mentions how Wilson followed Riley to a nearby street and attacked him. The writer includes quotes from the detective in charge of the case, who described Wilson as having caught up with Riley after he left his home and getting into a fight with him. The writer also presents the fact that Wilson called his girlfriend, Julie Evans, 41, to help him dispose of the murder weapon. Evans pleaded guilty to assisting an offender and will be sentenced on December 21st. The writer also mentions that the court heard Wilson claimed he didn't realize he had stabbed Riley until he read about it on Facebook the following day, but both wounds were inflicted with such force that this couldn't have been true. The writer concludes by encouraging the public to send any story ideas to the BBC's Yorkshire team. The article is written in a straightforward and factual manner and provides details about the case without bias.","496":"Mr Pullar, who is autistic and has bi-polar disorder, had two teeth knocked out when he was a patient, then aged 18, at Winterbourne View. The incident happened two years before the BBC's Panorama programme revealed widespread mistreatment at the home. Eleven care workers are being sentenced for abusing five patients there. Mr Pullar's twin brother, Tom, said that if the families of other patients at the hospital also came forward with events they would like reinvestigated, he wanted the reassurance they too would be looked at thoroughly by the police. He said: \"It's OK to have one review into what happened, but there's people out there who have been involved in abuse of these patients and they're free to walk away because they weren't there while the BBC were filming. \"It happened for three years before. The BBC were only filming for a five-week period and it's a culture that takes a very long time to develop.\" Raised the alarm The private hospital, now under new management, looks after people with severe learning difficulties.

His family said they were given mixed messages about what happened and were told at one point he had \"bitten the floor\". He was taken to Bristol Dental Hospital by Winterbourne View staff as an emergency patient, and two doctors there raised the alarm with the authorities because of the severity of his injuries. Dentists said his injuries were consistent with being punched. Senior dental consultant Dr Jane Luker said: \"I think they thought the injury he sustained wasn't consistent with what they were being told. \"He had allegedly bitten a carer and the injuries were sustained from him biting that carer. \"[But] because the teeth were pushed back palatally, towards the back of the mouth, it would be consistent with a punch","497":"The remuneration board has recommended that AMs receive up to \u00a3297 a month for care outside of normal working hours.

If you thought that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Socialist presidential hopeful brought down by a string of sex scandals, represented a dying breed, then you may have to think again. Disenchanted because, whatever the facts in the case, there are serious questions about how and why the affair has suddenly come to light. The French Greens, or to give their full name Europe Ecologie Les Verts (EELV), are a party divided on just about every issue that affects them. Allegations against Denis Baupin 'Sexual harassment' politician quits in France Denis Baupin belonged to a faction that supports continuing co-operation with President Francois Hollande. Indeed his wife, Emmanuelle Cosse, also a member of that faction, is actually a government minister. But in recent weeks the split in the party between joiners-in and stayers-out has turned nasty. Emmanuelle Cosse was fired from the Greens after accepting her government post. A few weeks ago Denis Baupin also resigned. Without taking away one iota from the seriousness of the case, it is impossible not to ask: Why are these accusations emerging now - just when Mr Baupin has become persona non grata? The Green Party has always been extremely vocal in the fight against sexism. So why did Denis Baupin's alleged victims (all members of the Greens or with links to them) not speak out before? Former Environment Minister Corinne Lepage has written an interesting article (in French) which chimes exactly with this line of reasoning. The Baupin affair, she says, is on two levels. 'Party casseroles' The first, obvious issue is the alleged sexual harassment by a leading politician. Given recent history, involving Dominique Strauss-Kahn and others, the claims against Mr Baupin come as no surprise, except perhaps that this time it is the supposedly ultra-ethical Green Party at the cent\n\nSummary:","1":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Both Mr Price and Mr ap Iorwerth are challenging Ms Wood for the leadership. Mr Price told BBC Wales' Newyddion 9 programme that Plaid Cymru should focus on building a positive message. Plaid Cymru ministers served in government from 2007 to 2011 as the junior partners in a coalition with Labour. But Mr Price insisted that the idea of a coalition involving Plaid Cymru after the 2021 election should be \"taken off the table\". \"The mandate I would seek from the members of Plaid Cymru is a very clear and singular one which says 'no' to a coalition with the Conservatives absolutely, but also says the same to the other 'Conservative' party, the small 'c' Conservative party, the party of the status quo who's been running Wales for the last 20 years,\" he said. The Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM said he would fully support Ms Wood as one of his closest friends in politics if she was re-elected, but he claimed Plaid had been stagnating under her leadership. \"We have to win - currently we are not on the right track,\" Mr Price said. \"We have to change gear and concentrate on success.

The charity said tens of red squirrels were run over each year and this was part of efforts to boost its numbers. Iwan Ellis-Roberts of the National Trust said: \"We're overjoyed plans have gone through. It helps them to populate other areas.\" In 2008, six red squirrels were released into the gardens at Plas Newydd and they now number more than 100. The bridge will link the grounds of the 18th Century mansion to neighbouring woodland and conservationists hope this will encourage the animals to safely scamper to new habitats. Holly Peek, a Red Squirrels Trust Wales ranger, said: \"Red squirrels much prefer being in the canopy - they don't like being on the floor - so it's hoped if we provide that option over crossing the road, they will take it. \"If there's more squirrels around, the population is going to grow and they will spread to new areas as well.\" It is part of a \u00a310,000 plan that also includes a new squirrel hide and nest boxes. The National Trust is in the process of raising the cash and hopes the bridge will be ready for the autumn. Mr Ellis-Roberts said the bridge brought some risks as red squirrels could come into contact with greys, which can carry a pox that is deadly to their native counterparts. Although Anglesey is considered grey squirrel-free, Mr Ellis-Roberts said there had been sightings of the animal and it is thought they may have swum over from the mainland or crossed the bridge. There are plans to install camera traps on the bridge so its effectiveness can be monitored.\n\nSummary:","4":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Visitors will be able to tour the house where he wrote Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby, and finished writing The Pickwick Papers. The writer's former home has been stripped as far as possible of any modern additions and restored to its original condition. The Great Expectations project, funded largely through the Heritage Lottery Fund, has also restored neighbouring 49 Doughty Street to include a visitor and learning centre and a cafe, welcoming regular school trips for the first time. Writing desk Visitors will be able to tour Dickens's dining room, complete with place names for famous visitors such as William Macready, the great Shakespearean actor of the time, and to see Dickens's marriage licence.

The museum includes photographs on display to the public for the first time of the 1865 railway accident in Staplehurst, Kent, in which Dickens was involved.

A lawyer for Ms Daniels has made claims of a cover-up, and others have raised questions about potentially illegal campaign payments. The president rejects all the allegations, and lawyers are suing Ms Daniels back for breaking this deal. Mr Trump denies that any money from his 2016 presidential campaign was used to buy Ms Daniels' silence, and says that the affair never happened. Using campaign funds could have been a violation of federal law. But while Mr Trump's supporters have largely ignored the story, along with allegations of sexual assault and the infamous Access Hollywood tape, the Stormy Daniels case could see the president testify in court - with 2018 mid-term elections just around the corner. Who is Stormy Daniels? She was born in Louisiana in 1979. She moved into the adult film industry first as a performer, before in 2004 branching out into directing and also writing. Her stage name comes from M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's bassist Nikki Sixx's daughter Storm, and the US whisky Jack Daniels - which southerner Ms Clifford chose after reading an ad calling the drink \"a Southern favourite\". You may also recognise her cameo appearances in films The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up, and the music video for Maroon Five's song Wake Up Call. She also thought of running for a US Senate seat in Louisiana in 2010 but called off her run after she said her candidacy was not being taken seriously. What does she allege? It all goes back to July 2006 - when the White House was merely a twinkle in Donald Trump's eye. Ms Daniels says she met him that month at a charity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada. In a 2011 interview with In Touch Weekly, published in full in January, she says Mr Trump invited her to dinner and that she went to meet him in his hotel room. \"He was all sp\n\nSummary:","6":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Modelled on the Drudge Report, the American aggregator site that generates huge traffic, Westmonster will be powered by the social media reach of Leave.EU, the campaign to which Mr Banks gave close to \u00a37m - the largest donation in British political history. Leave.EU has nearly 800,000 followers on Facebook and Mr Heaver believes he can use that base to generate substantial traffic from day one. Westmonster will publish some original news, and Mr Heaver hopes to enlist more celebrity writers than backbench MPs. The site will launch with an article from Nigel Farage, and Mr Heaver is open about wanting to ape the opinionated, anti-establishment, highly provocative tone of Breitbart. This launch is significant for several reasons. It shows that the anti-establishment media which helped to power the campaign of Donald Trump is coming to Britain. It's no coincidence that Westmonster is launching the day before Mr Trump's inauguration - an event that will be attended, almost alone among Brits, by Nigel Farage, Arron Banks, and Mr Banks's business associate Andy Wigmore, who are together hosting a celebratory party on Saturday night in a hotel across the road from the White House.

Transport for London (TfL) blamed unions for delaying the service. It said \"a fair and sustainable pay offer and cast-iron guarantees on work-life balance\" had been offered but unions had not put this to their members and came up with last-minute demands. 'Perpetual dithering' A 24-hour service on the Jubilee, Victoria, Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines had been due to start at weekends on 12 September. Unions took industrial action during the summer having called for increased pay and a limit on how many all-night shifts their members would be asked to do.

Talks adjourned today and the parties are reflecting upon their positions.

It was discovered Mr Lytton had lived in Pakistan for 10 years and had flown to London Heathrow two days before his body was found, the inquest at Rochdale Coroner's Court was told. It emerged he had paid cash for a five-night hotel stay in the capital, but travelled north after one night despite having no known links to the area.

The idea is that the buyer can quickly get his or her hands on a product that may not be available to buy or import where he or she lives (country A), or that the item may simply be a lot cheaper abroad (country B). So with transactions made via the three companies' websites and apps, travellers who are due to fly from country B to country A can purchase and transport the products for the buyers. They can then arrange to meet to hand them over. Over the past 24 months Olivier says he has transported everything from three months' supply of French salami to the US, bags of Japanese sweets called \"Tokyo banana\", and 20kg of fabric samples for a woman starting her own business. \"I discover new products I have never heard of,\" he says. Worldcraze was launched in 2012 by French entrepreneurs Frederic Simons and Guillaume Cayard. On a trip to New York Frederic noticed a large price difference between Levi's jeans in France and the US, and the idea was born.

There has been widespread anger at recent price increases of up to 10%. Ministers are also set to meet firms to discuss claims some direct debit customers have been overpaying. This followed newspaper reports claiming ministers are concerned that firms are using direct debit customers - many of whose monthly payments are based on estimates of their energy consumption - to stockpile large sums of money. Ministers are reported to be looking at the interest that firms generate on this money and potentially introducing a new code of conduct for such payments - although no date has been set for a meeting. 'Best answer' NPpower, British Gas, SSE and Scottish Power have all said they will increase electricity and gas prices by between 8% and 10% while Eon and EDF are expected to follow suit. The increases will take the cost of an average dual-fuel bill, in most cases, to more than \u00a31,400 a year. The six firms account for about 90% of the UK energy retail market. Labour wants a freeze in household bills but the government says this is a gimmick and says it is focused on reviewing competition and looking at a potential reduction in the environmental charges levied on monthly bills.

Five things to know about Kashmir Kashmir - the region at the heart of dispute The teenager blinded by pellets in Indian Kashmir The passenger bus reportedly came under fire from India's side of the de facto border as it was travelling from Kel to Muzaffarabad in the Neelum valley region. Pakistani officials accused India of deliberately targeting civilians. There was no immediate response from India. On Tuesday the Indian army promised \"heavy\" retribution\" after one of its patrols was ambushed in the Kupwara sector. Pakistan says more than 30 civilians and 11 soldiers have been killed on its side in fighting since August. India says 12 civilians and 11 of its soldiers have died over a similar period. Dozens more have been injured and thousands of people have left the area or are trapped in their homes. How bad is the situation? Before the new deaths this week, the Pakistani military apparently suffered its biggest single loss of life in Kashmir since the 2003 truce, when seven soldiers were killed in shelling in a single day. Firing from both sides has increased since the deadly militant attack on an Indian army base on 18 September. India hit back on 30 September with cross-border \"surgical strikes\" targeting militant groups blamed for killing the soldiers.

DNA sequencing has been unable to determine the species. Scientists say that could mean the specimen represents an evolutionary link between wolves and modern dogs. Radiocarbon dating was able to determine the age of the puppy when it died and how long it has been frozen. Genome analyses showed that it was male. Researcher Dave Stanton at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden told CNN the DNA sequencing issue meant the animal could come from a population that is a common ancestor of both dogs and wolves. \"We have a lot of data from it already, and with that amount of data, you'd expect to tell if it was one or the other,\" he said. Another researcher from the centre, Love Dalen, tweeted a question about whether the specimen is a wolf cub or \"possibly the oldest dog ever found\". Scientists will continue with DNA sequencing and think the findings could reveal a lot about the evolution of dogs. The puppy has been named \"Dogor\", which means \"friend\" in the Yakut language and is also the start of the question \"dog or wolf?\" Modern dogs are believed to be descendants of wolves, but there is debate over when dogs were domesticated. A study published in 2017 suggested domestication could have occurred 20,000 to 40,000 years ago. .\n\nSummary:","20":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

In a separate interview, Lord Cullen said it could be a \"safeguard against wrongful conviction\". Scottish government ministers want to end the requirement for corroboration. Proposals to drop it are among a series of reforms contained in the Scottish government's Criminal Justice Bill. Ministers believe more rape, sexual offence and domestic abuse cases would be heard in court if the current need for two different and independent sources of evidence was removed. Scotland's top prosecutor, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, thinks that corroboration is denying access to justice to victims of crimes committed in private. \"In the past two years, 170 cases of rape have had no proceedings taken in them because of insufficient evidence, which in many instances is a lack of corroboration,\" Mr Mulholland said. Lords Hamilton and Cullen - who have each served as Scotland's top judge - suggested that this issue could be addressed by more limited reforms. Lord Cullen told the BBC consideration might be given to a system which would give a trial judge the power to suspend the need for corroboration in certain cases. Ministers have made clear they intend to press ahead with ending the requirement in principle. 'Quite dangerous' Lords Hamilton and Cullen fear this could increase the likelihood of miscarriages of justice. \"There is a serious risk that that would be so,\" said Lord Hamilton. \"They should retain corroboration as an essential element of our criminal jurisdiction in Scotland,\" he said.

Mr D\u00edaz-Canel had been serving as first vice-president for the past five years. Even though Mr D\u00edaz-Canel was born after the revolution, he is a staunch ally of Ra\u00fal Castro and is not expected to make any radical changes. There was \"no room in Cuba for those who strive for the restoration of capitalism\" he said in his inaugural address. 'The Revolution continues its course' He was elected by the members of the National Assembly, all 605 of whom were voted in in March after standing unopposed. Mr Castro is expected to continue wielding considerable political influence in his role as the leader of Cuba's ruling Communist Party.

The moment captured the image of political continuity the Cuban government has been keen to stress: an ordered handover of power from one generation to the next. There was a small surprise, a single dissenting vote to D\u00edaz-Canel's nomination as president, as he was confirmed by just 99.83% of the vote. Still, he had the one and only ballot he really needed: Ra\u00fal Castro's. In his inaugural speech, Mr D\u00edaz-Canel said that his mandate was \"to ensure the continuity of the Cuban revolution at a key historic moment\" and assured the members of the National Assembly that \"the revolution continues its course\". He said that Cuba's foreign policy would remain \"unaltered\" and that any \"necessary changes\" would be decided by the Cuban people. A large part of his speech was dedicated to praising his predecessor in office, to whom he said: \"Cuba needs you.\" This prompted the more than 600 National Assembly members to rise to their feet and give the 86-year-old former leader a standing ovation.

High unemployment The cinema is believed to be the longest continuously run one in Wales, she said. \"As far as Brynmawr is concerned it's a historic building. \"They're building a new cinema at the works in Ebbw Vale, but we live in an area of high unemployment and families of two, three or four kids can't afford to get there. \"People who are carers also go there with the people they look after every Wednesday without fail - it's difficult for them to go further afield.\" Deputy leader of Blaenau Gwent council Stephen Thomas said: \"This year's budget is a budget unlike any other. \"As a result of the spending cuts passed to us from central government, we have to find considerable savings and there is more pressure to come in future years.

The opposition Conservatives are expected to win the popular vote but have not translated that into seats. They are projected to take 121, up from the 95 they held before. Although Monday night's results saw a sharp decline in seats for the country's left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), its leader, Jagmeet Singh, could become the kingmaker. The NDP is projected to take 24 seats in the 338-seat parliament. Quebec's separatist party, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which competes only in that province, fared much better. It is expected to take 32 seats, compared to the 10 it won in 2015. Turnout is currently listed at 66%. The federal election was seen as a referendum on Mr Trudeau, who had a bumpy first term, tainted by scandal. Mr Trudeau told cheering supporters in Montreal that voters had \"rejected division and negativity... and they rejected cuts and austerity and voted in favour of a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change\". He said: \"Thank you for having faith in us to move our country in the right direction.\" And to those who did not back him, he promised his party would govern for everyone. His weakened grip on power is being seen as a rebuke of his record but the result is bitterly disappointing for Conservative leader Andrew Scheer. Why has Trudeau's popularity fallen? Mr Trudeau swept into power in 2015 promising \"real change\" and a slew of progressive pledges. But after four years in power, Mr Trudeau faced criticism for his ability to follow through.

The research was based on 3,000 children aged five from different socio-economic backgrounds in Scotland. The study found poorer children were twice as likely to have emotional and physical development difficulties. They were also twice as likely to have problems with communication and expressing themselves or making themselves understood. The report's authors said poorer youngsters were 50% more likely to face difficulties mixing with other children and were 40% more likely to be behind in their cognitive development - the ability to gain knowledge and learn. 'Glaring gap' Douglas Hamilton, Save the Children's head in Scotland, said: \"The long-term ramifications of these developmental difficulties for children in poverty are very serious. \"To discover that this 'developmental divide' begins before a child even starts school is incredibly worrying. \"Ultimately, the consequences of this glaring gap are found in reduced future opportunities and life chances of children who live in poverty.\" The organisation said figures from later in the education system showed that these children begin their school life behind their classmates and never catch up. The charity, which carried out the study with Scotcen Social Research, wants the Scottish government to take a number of measures to better support children in their early years.

Chernobyl, the world's worst nuclear accident, sent a plume of radiation over large parts of Europe. \"The catastrophe at Chernobyl power station left a deep wound that Ukraine will need to live with for many years ahead,\" Mr Yanukovych said at the conference in Kiev. \"We thank the international community for not leaving Ukraine alone with this problem.\" Mr Yanukovych said that to turn Chernobyl into an \"ecologically safe site\", it was necessary \"to build a new sarcophagus around the damaged reactor as well as a secure storage facility for spent nuclear fuel.\" \"The catastrophe has affected millions of people; thousands died and tens of thousands continue to suffer,\" Mr Yanukovych said. According to a UN report, considered the most comprehensive to date on the disaster's health impact, Chernobyl directly caused the deaths of 30 workers and radiation injuries to more than 100 others. Subsequently, more than 6,000 cases of thyroid cancer were reported in children and adolescents who were exposed at the time of the accident in Ukraine and Russia, with many of these cancers \"most likely caused by radiation exposures shortly after the accident\". \"Apart from this increase, there is no evidence of a major public health impact attributable to radiation exposure two decades after the accident,\" the UN assessment adds.

Shaved from the edges of coins dating back to 1560, the precious metal would have been melted down and sold. Finds liaison officer Kurt Adams said: \"Forty to 60 clippings is normal - one of this size is very, very rare.\" Mr Warren - who unearthed the Yorkley Roman coin hoard in 2012 - said he was testing out a \"beginner's metal detector\" in a field, when he made the discovery. \"It was about four inches down, all in a big ball - we thought it was pieces of fencing until I spotted the words James I and Elizabeth I,\" he said. \"There were about 500 clippings - like pig tails - ranging from half crowns right down to pennies, all silver.\" With hanging literally too good for those caught clipping the edges off silver coins in the 17th Century, Mr Warren said whoever buried the hoard had been risking their life. \"For women the punishment was being burnt at the stake, for a bloke it was being hung, drawn and quartered,\" he said. \"It would have been a lot to have been caught with.\" Mr Adams, from the Portable Antiquities Scheme, said the hoard, currently being catalogued at the British Museum, was not only \"one of the biggest\" but a \"fantastic bit of social history\". \"The earliest clippings date from the reign of Elizabeth I, so 1560s to 1570s, and the latest from 1645,\" he said. \"It showed people were defrauding the Mint when it was enormously important that coins weren't tampered with in any way - so it's an incredibly rare find.\"\n\nSummary:","34":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It means she feels virtually no pain, and never feels anxious or afraid. It wasn't until she was 65 she realised she was different - when doctors couldn't believe she didn't need painkillers after a serious operation. When she had surgery on her hand, doctors warned her she should expect pain afterwards. When she felt nothing, her anaesthetist - Dr Devjit Srivastava - sent her to pain geneticists at University College London (UCL) and Oxford University. After tests, they found gene mutations which meant that she did not feel pain like most people. Not just 'incredibly healthy' Jo, from Whitebridge, near Inverness, told the BBC Scotland news website that doctors didn't believe her when she said she wouldn't need pain relief after surgery. She said: \"We had banter before theatre when I guaranteed I wouldn't need painkillers. \"When he found I hadn't had any, he checked my medical history and found I had never asked for painkillers.\" That's when she was referred to specialists in England. Once diagnosed, Jo realised that she wasn't just \"incredibly healthy\", as she'd believed. She said: \"Looking back, I realise I hadn't needed painkillers, but if you don't need them you don't question why you don't. \"You are what you are, until someone points it out you don't question it.

In one case, the virus remained highly pathogenic. The US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) said publishing the work in full holds significant potential for harm. The board explains that its main concern was that publishing the experiments in detail could help someone to develop viruses for harmful purposes. But it acknowledges the work holds \"clear benefits\" in alerting humanity to the potential H5N1 threat, and that it could lead to greater preparation and potential development of novel strategies for disease control. The board states that by recommending that the basic results be communicated without methods or details, the benefits to society will be maximised and the risks minimised. Together with the release of this official statement, the journal Nature has also published a Q&A with the acting chair of the NSABB. In it, he explains in more detail why they have recommended redaction for the paper in press at Nature even though the modified H5N1 virus that it describes is not highly pathogenic.

The paper has also reported Ms Arcuri told four friends that she had an affair with Mr Johnson while he was mayor of London. On Friday, the Greater London Authority's monitoring officer referred the prime minister to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) - whose job it is to oversee the conduct of the mayor and other members of the GLA. Asked on the Andrew Marr show if he had declared any interest, Mr Johnson said \"there was no interest to declare\". \"I was proud of everything I did as mayor of London,\" he added. He also attacked Sadiq Khan, the current mayor of London, saying the Labour politician \"could possibly spend more time investing in police officers than he is investing in press officers and peddling this kind of stuff\".

The government says fewer secondary teachers are needed, but universities will continue to play a \"vital role\". Academics warn expertise will be lost. They say student teachers on university-based courses typically spend two-thirds of their time in schools and argue that the distinction being made between the two routes into teaching is false. Universities which run teacher training courses have received a letter from the Training Development Agency (TDA), which says secondary courses with small numbers of students will only be funded if they are delivered through \"school-led programmes\". 'No guarantee' The number of places universities can have for teacher training is set by the TDA. There are now about 330 secondary school courses which have been allocated 10 places or fewer. The letter from the TDA says: \"The reduction in secondary school places and the Department for Education's strategy to increase school-led provision may result in some providers having to consider their involvement in initial teacher training. \"There are a number of cohorts that have been identified as potentially unviable due to their small size.\" It goes on: \"We are informing providers now that there is no guarantee that they will be allocated any places in the identified small cohorts for 2013-14 onwards\". The TDA expects universities to merge courses either within or between institutions, so, for example, one university in a region might agree to train geography teachers and another history teachers.

The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has described the approach to care homes as \"shambolic\" as staff have struggled to get hold of the aprons, gloves and goggles needed. What has gone wrong? How well prepared was the UK? Last week England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, was saying during the televised daily briefing that the UK was an international \"exemplar\" for pandemic preparedness. She faced howls of derision on social media, from MPs and commentators for her comments. But it was perfectly understandable why she made such a claim. The UK has long been seen as an international leader when it comes to pandemic planning and public health. It had a stockpile of kit housed at a giant temperature-controlled warehouse in the north-west of England. There were millions of pieces of equipment, which have proved invaluable in the first few months of the pandemic. And, despite the demands placed on it, the stockpile has still not been completely used up. Nonetheless, frontline staff have found themselves in a position where they have not always had the kit they need. It is worth saying, though, that the UK is not alone in this. Many countries have faced similar problems. In France, President Macron apologised live on TV for shortcomings, including in this area. The ability to judge the preparations is also hampered by the fact the government has refused to publish the full findings of its 2016 pandemic drill named Exercise Cygnus.

He was also ordered to pay costs of about \u00a3750. Dure, from Southampton, said his online career might be over but his team would continue his work. Dure appeared in a BBC Inside Out programme in 2017, when he explained how he posed as children on the internet to \"trap\" sex offenders. His Facebook page, which shows videos of him confronting suspected paedophiles, has more than 200,000 followers. Southampton Magistrates' Court heard he had accused Paul Farhad, 42, of being a \"violent psychopath\" and a \"massive danger to society\" in a Facebook post in November 2017. Mr Farhad, from Eastleigh, said 111,000 people had viewed the message, which he said also implied he was a paedophile. As a result he lost his job, paint was sprayed on his door and a brick was thrown through his window, he told the court. Alfred Underwood, defending, said Mr Dure accepted Mr Farhad was not a paedophile, which was \"nowhere suggested\" in the Facebook message read out in court.

They estimated that around 110,000 people in French Polynesia were affected by the radioactive fallout. The number represented \"almost the entire\" population at the time, the researchers found. French Polynesia, a French territory made up of hundreds of islands and atolls including Tahiti, was the site of dozens of nuclear tests over 30 years. Over the course of two years, researchers analysed around 2,000 documents released by the French military and recreated the impact of \"the most contaminating\" of France's nuclear tests carried out between 1966 and 1974. The study was carried out in collaboration between French news website Disclose, researchers from Princeton University and British firm Interprt. The 41st test took place over Mururoa Atoll on 17 July 1974, when the atomic cloud took a different trajectory than planned. Some 42 hours after the test codenamed Centaur, \"the inhabitants of Tahiti and the surrounding islands of the Windward group were subjected to significant amounts of ionising radiation\", the report says. The area was home to 110,000 people and Tahiti's main city, Papeete, alone had a population of 80,000. According to the investigation, the resulting radiation from the French tests was between two and 10 times higher than estimates given by France's Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in a 2006 report. One reason, according to the findings, is that the CEA \"did not always take into account the drinking of contaminated rainwater\" when calculating the dose of radiation individuals were likely to have been exposed to. Catherine Serda, who was a child at the time of the tests, told France Inter radio that eight members of her family contracted cancer. \"This is not normal.

Thousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted. Mr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role. The opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. News of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release. US President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. \"The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,\" Jake Sullivan said. How did events unfold? When Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. The plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for \"technical reasons\", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. \"I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,\" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. \"Have you been waiting for me long?\" he asked border guards.

The move prompted anger from the insurance industry, which said that premiums had risen as a result. Now the government has had a re-think. Following consultation by the Ministry of Justice and the Scottish government, new draft legislation has been published that would change the way the so-called discount rate is calculated. This would need to be agreed by Parliament - a process that the government said would take months, not weeks. If it becomes law then insurance premiums could fall slightly, but compensation payouts made to about 3,000 people in motor accidents a year could fall too. How compensation works Accident victims are paid compensation in a single lump sum, which in serious cases is supposed to support them for the rest of their lives. But someone who receives that lump sum can actually increase that amount by investing it, and getting a cash return. So to be fair to insurance companies, the payout was reduced accordingly. That changed in March when this so-called discount rate was changed for the first time in 16 years The Ministry of Justice decided to reduce the discount rate from 2.5% to minus 0.75% - a move which it said was determined by existing law. The change was ordered because the formula assumes the victim will invest his or her money in government bonds. But such interest rates - or bond yields - had fallen and had become negative, meaning accident victims would actually be losing money in real terms over the long run. The British Insurance Brokers' Association argued that victims would pick better investments than government bonds. The change in March means insurance companies are paying a premium to accident victims, rather than getting a rebate on the sums they pay out. Now the government is planning to change the rules.

Meanwhile, the death toll in the blaze has risen to 38. Forty-six others are being treated for their injuries. The blaze took place in the town of Sivakasi, the hub of India's firecracker industry. The town has 700 factories and produces 90% of India's fireworks. The fire broke out at the Om Shakti factory, one of the biggest in the town and spread through packed warehouses. Najmul Hoda, superintendent of police for Virudhunagar district where Sivakasi town is located, told the BBC that 38 bodies had been recovered from the site and there were \"no more bodies inside\". He said the factory's licence had been suspended on Tuesday for safety rule violations and \"no work should have been happening there\" on Wednesday. The owner has absconded, police say. The fire may have been sparked by untrained workers mixing chemicals wrongly, police said.

The public sector pay freeze was announced last year by the government as it tried to reduce the UK's deficit. The TUC said the government was making public sector workers a \"scapegoat\". The median figure is the one at which half of workers are getting a higher settlement and half are getting a lower one. Bank of England policymakers will study the figures closely. Some members have indicated that they are more likely to vote for a rise in interest rates if there is evidence that high inflation, currently at 4.5%, is leading to bigger wage increases. 'Key month' IDS, which monitors annual pay settlements, said the increase in the private sector median reflected a rise in manufacturing pay awards. \"April is a key month for public sector pay reviews and the latest figures begin to show the effects of government policy on public sector pay,\" IDS said. But it added that the median for the whole economy remains at 2.5%, despite the addition of the freezes in the public sector. IDS said that some sectors in particular were starting to offer pay rises. \"There is a little bit of a return to normality in the private sector,\" Ken Mulkearn, editor of the IDS report, told the BBC. \"Industries like the car industry and parts of the utilities industry are leading the way on settlements, so they're good areas to work in terms of pay rises at the moment.\" TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said while it was encouraging to see private sector pay awards increase, they were still running significantly below inflation, and the public sector was still feeling the real pain. \"By forcing through pay cuts and seeking to increase pension contributions on top of heavy job losses, the government is making public servants the scapegoat for a financial crisis they played no part in causing,\" he said.\n\nSummary:","54":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But a housing group has warned there is still a desperate shortage of affordable properties. The Welsh government said the Whiteheads development would provide up to 400 homes and is expected to deliver a \u00a3140m economic boost to the area, creating up to 1,500 jobs in the process. There are plans for 260 homes at Eirin Park in Tonyrefail which is expected to create \u00a385m for the local economy and create up to 800 jobs. The Welsh government has also agreed to loan the Whiteheads Development Company \u00a37m and the Parc Eirin Development Company \u00a31m to help deliver the projects quickly. Both are subsidiaries of Tai Tirion, a not-for-profit organisation created following an initial alliance between the Welsh government and the Principality Building Society to deliver affordable homes. \"Subject to planning permission these two new projects are anticipated to create around 2,300 jobs and deliver an economic benefit in the region of \u00a3225m to the local economies,\" said Economy Minister Edwina Hart. \"These are significant figures that will support job creation in the construction industry as well as businesses within the supply chain. \"They will also help transform brownfield sites into thriving communities and provide affordable homes in places where people want to live which are within the financial reach of young families and lower income families.\" 'Neglected land' The Whiteheads and Eirin Park developments are the latest additions to the Tai Tirion portfolio which also contains The Mill, a \u00a3100m affordable housing development on the site of an old paper mill in Cardiff.

Appearing at Teesside Crown Court, the 29-year-old, of Micklow Close, Redcar, was given a 12-month jail sentence. She had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to being in charge of a dangerously out-of-control dog. The 10-minute attack happened shortly before 05:00 BST on Cotswold Drive, Redcar. One of the dogs Stephens was with ran across the road to attack the terriers, the court was told, before the other two joined in. Victim suffers flashbacks The victim, a nurse, had been walking her pets on a lead before starting a shift at work. She tried to protect her Yorkshire and Cairn terriers by lying on top of them and suffered serious injuries to her arms and hands. The court heard she was unable to work for two months following the attack, that she suffers flashbacks and is so anxious she is now thinking of leaving the town. Judge Stephen Ashurst said although Stephens did not own the dogs, she was well aware how dangerous they were and the safety restrictions placed on them. The three animals have since been destroyed. Stephens, who was led from the dock in tears, was said to be incredibly remorseful for what had happened. She will serve six months in prison and then be subject to a six-month supervision order.

Signatories included Alexander Pereira, of La Scala in Milan, and Peter Gelb, of New York's Metropolitan Opera. The ENO was placed under \"special funding arrangements\" last month. Arts Council England said the organisation must improve its business model or face funding cuts. It had already cut the ENO's funding by 29%, reducing its annual grant cut from \u00a317.2m in 2014\/15 to \u00a312.4m in the next financial year. The global opera scene has now rallied behind the organisation. Senior figures from Russia, the US and Europe said they were \"alarmed\" by recent questions about the ENO and the leadership of its \"talented artistic director\" John Berry. \"Under Berry's strong 10-year leadership, the ENO is today regarded as one of the most creative forces in opera, consistently producing important new work,\" the letter said [subscription required]. \"At a time when it has helped to further embellish London's reputation as a leading centre of cultural creativity, it doesn't seem fair for the ENO to now be under fire.\" 'Financial woes' Last month Arts Council England announced it had dropped ENO from its national portfolio of organisations for 2015-18.

It had previously been restricted to the Chinese military and government. A spokesman said that Beidou is targeting a 70-80% share of the Chinese market in related location services by 2020. The China Satellite Navigation Office added that by that time it also intended the service to be available across the globe. Growth plan Chinese officials say that Beidou can identify a user's location to 10m (33ft), their velocity to within 0.2 metres per second, and clock synchronisation signals to within 50 nanoseconds. At present the receiver chips cost several times more than their GPS equivalents. However - assuming prices fall - the Chinese government believes manufacturers will want to build them into equipment alongside those made for the US system, to offer users improved coverage. Six satellites are already in orbit, but officials said they planned to add a further 40 to the system over the next decade, according to a report by China Daily. Satellite launches Organisers have estimated that the market for transport, weather, and telecom spin-off services from Beidou's signals could be worth 200bn yuan ($32bn; \u00a320bn) by 2015. However, it is widely thought another motivation for the project is China's desire not to be reliant on a foreign-operated system that could be turned off at a time of conflict, The country recently showed off domestically-built drone aircraft at the China International Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition, which would be reliant on such location data to operate. Beidou is one of a growing number of alternatives to GPS under development. Russia is developing the Glonass system for both civilian and military use. It has 23 operational satellites in orbit.

Women born in the 1950s claim the rise is unfair because they were not given enough time to make adjustments to cope with years without a state pension. They argued the changes were discrimination, but judges disagreed. In a summary of the High Court's decision, the judges said: \"There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law. Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.\" The court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was \"it could be justified on the facts\". To chants of \"the fight goes on\" from supporters, Joanne Welch, who led the campaign, said outside court: \"Where do we go from here? Well, where will the government go from here is the better question.\" She referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to look at the state pension age issue with \"fresh vigour\", adding: \"We will be holding you to that undertaking.\" She said she was \"rather puzzled\" by the court's ruling, but added: \"We can take this, we've got broad shoulders.\" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"We welcome the High Court's judgment. It has always been our view that the changes we made to women's state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.\" What was the case about? Up until 2010, women received their state pensions at the age of 60 but that has been rising since then. While most campaigners support pension age equality, they argued that the government was discriminatory in the way it has introduced it.

Ex-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund said he had prepared for a protest, not \"a military-style coordinated assault\". Four people died after pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol. Three of the four officials testifying on Tuesday to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee resigned in the immediate wake of the attack, in which one Capitol Police officer was killed. Acting Washington DC police chief Robert Contee III told lawmakers, who are holding the first public hearing into the attack, that he was \"stunned\" by how long it took for the Pentagon to deploy National Guard troops to help quell the riots. Democrats charge that the attack amounted to an insurrection, and impeached former President Donald Trump for allegedly inciting the mob. He was later acquitted by the Senate, becoming the first president in US history to be impeached twice. What did officials say? All three officials agreed that there appeared to be a level of co-ordination and planning from the crowd. Mr Sund said that pipe bombs that were placed at the edge of the security perimeter appeared to be intended to draw law enforcement away from the Capitol building. \"When the group arrived at the perimeter, they did not act like any group of protesters I had ever seen,\" said the 30-year police veteran. \"A clear lack of accurate and complete intelligence across several federal agencies contributed to this event and not poor planning by the United States Capitol Police,\" he added.

Israel and the US opposed the move, saying it was politically motivated. It was the first such approval since Palestine was controversially granted membership of Unesco last year. Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity - originally constructed in 399 above a cave traditionally believed to be the birthplace of Jesus and rebuilt after fire in the 6th Century - is among the holiest sites in Christianity The short section of the pilgrimage route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem - following the historical route believed to have been taken by Mary and Joseph - is used for the procession of the Patriarchs at Christmas. An estimated two million people visit the two sites every year. At a meeting in the Russian city of St Petersburg on Friday, Unesco delegates voted 13 to six in favour of giving both of them World Heritage Site status \"on an emergency basis\", entitling them to UN protection and funding for restoration work the Palestinians say is urgent. Controversy When the result of the secret ballot was announced, there were loud cheers and fist pumping from the Palestinian delegation, reports the BBC's Jon Donnison in Ramallah. \"These sites are threatened with total destruction through the Israeli occupation, through the building of the separation wall, because of all the Israeli sanctions and the measures that have been taken to stifle the Palestinian identity,\" permanent delegate Elias Wadih Sanbar said.

Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said all public gatherings and demonstrations must be agreed in advance with the municipal authorities as well as regional divisions of the interior ministry and the Federal Security Service, the FSB. \"The president has issued an instruction to the organisers of the Olympic Games, together with the leadership of Krasnodar Territory and the Sochi mayor's office, to select a venue in the city where rallies, demonstrations and other events, including, if necessary, protests, could be freely held,\" Mr Peskov said. But limits can be placed on the number of people taking part in demonstrations, according to the presidential decree. Protests groups, such as those campaigning for gay rights and political reform, had complained at the restrictions on the right to stage demonstrations at the Games. Security concerns Security has been a major concern in the run-up to the event, with fears of attack by militant groups. Two suicide bomb attacks killed 34 people in the southern city of Volgograd on 29 and 30 December.

In an interview published in the Daily Mirror and Daily Express newspapers, Malek revealed he spoke to director Cary Fukunaga to confirm he would not be playing a religious fundamentalist. \"That was clearly not his vision,\" the actor is quoted as saying. \"He's a very different kind of terrorist.\" Malek said he was playing \"a great character\" and that he was \"very excited\" to be cast in the film, due out in April 2020. \"It's another extremely clever script from the people who have figured out exactly what people want in those movies,\" he continued. His character is described as \"a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology\" in the film's official plot summary. Malek's casting was announced when the latest Bond film - currently known as \"Bond 25\" - began shooting in April. The production, which marks Daniel Craig's fifth outing as secret agent James Bond, has rarely been out of the headlines since.

Such handouts are banned in the UK, where the practice is known as \"treating\", but they are seen elsewhere in Europe.

The speech is seen as a watershed moment for Mr Zuma, who is facing a court case over the use of $23m (\u00a315m) of state money to upgrade his home. The opposition has rejected Mr Zuma's offer to repay some of the money. Before being ejected from parliament in Cape Town, the EFF MPs chanted \"Zupta must fall\", referring to the president's alleged links to the influential Gupta family. How Zuma's home has grown \"Zuma is no longer a president that deserves respect from anyone,\" EFF leader Julius Malema said. Earlier, hundreds of opposition supporters took to the streets in Cape Town to protest over a range of issues, including Mr Zuma's handling of the economy. But supporters of the governing African National Congress (ANC) demonstrated to show their loyalty to Mr Zuma. At the scene: Karen Allen, BBC News The EFF staked their claim in parliament, sporting their trademark red overalls and matching hard hats. This was in contrast to the glamorous ball gowns and national costumes worn by some of the guests on the red carpet. Singing songs of land ownership and insulting the president with crude songs referring to the Nkandla scandal as they entered parliament, they were the ones everyone here was watching, even if some ANC figures studiously tried to ignore EFF leader Julius Malema and his noisy crowd. The EFF promised to obey the rules of parliament but challenged Mr Zuma's speech with interruptions. Police used stun grenades after clashes broke out between rival protesters in the city's central business district. Riot police also set up barricades to keep protesters away from parliament.

Residents of Illapel, near the quake's epicentre, fled into the streets in terror as their homes began to sway. In the coastal town of Coquimbo, waves of 4.7m (15ft) hit the shore. A tsunami alert was issued for the entire Chilean coast but has since been lifted. Tsunami waves also hit the coast further north and south of the quake's epicentre, with waves half a metre higher than usual as far north as La Punta. The quake lasted for more than three minutes and there have been dozens of aftershocks. Gloria Navarro, who lives in the coastal town of La Serena, said people were \"running in all directions\". At the scene: Jane Chambers, freelance journalist I'm on the coast about 130km (80 miles) south from the worst affected area of Coquimbo. Our house is on top of a cliff and made of wood. It was shaking and shuddering. At first I thought it was just a tremor but it was really strong and went on for around three minutes. It was much stronger than any tremors I had ever felt before. The house is fine as most of Chile's buildings are built to withstand tremors. The local town was evacuated. The restaurant down on the beach is flooded but most things here are returning to normal. Officials said 1,800 people in Illapel were left without drinking water. Electricity providers said hundreds of thousands of their clients in the worst-affected Coquimbo region had no power.

But despite various measures, it concluded \"the impact on the Gwent Levels is too great\". NRW has made its final submission to a long-running public inquiry into the planned road around Newport. It said \"a number of limited but nonetheless significant objections have proved incapable of resolution\". These included \"direct and indirect effects\" of the project on wildlife habitats and four sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) on the Gwent Levels. It said the scale of permanent loss of SSSIs was both \"unprecedented\" and contrary to wildlife and environment laws. This includes the loss of reens - a network of drainage channels - on the Caldicot and Wentlooge levels. \"The extent of this loss and the timescales for construction of the M4 are such that NRW cannot have confidence that the reduced available habitat will be able to support the full range of SSSI features,\" it said. Welsh ministers support the so-called \"black route\" - a 15-mile (24km), six-lane stretch of new motorway around Newport - to ease congestion and remove what is regarded as an obstacle to economic improvement. If given the go-ahead, the motorway would be scheduled to open in 2024.

According to the Daily Mail, Downing Street is considering ordering Mr Rees-Mogg to give up his monthly slot on the radio station LBC, where he made his remarks.

This prompted a race against time to find a potential donor. But over the weekend her family received the \"fantastic news\" a match had been found in Germany. Her father Leigh, 49, said: \"You can't believe what a relief it was. Amy is obviously relieved and delighted, it gives us all hope. \"She knows even though she's had a challenging time, there's a pathway forwards. \"To the donor I would say thank you. They have saved my daughter's life.\" Amy was first diagnosed with \"high-risk\" leukaemia aged 12. She received the most intensive rounds of chemotherapy administered to children diagnosed with the disease, Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) said. This led to liver problems, steroid-induced diabetes and several allergic reactions to the medications. Her therapy was due to end on 4 July this year, but shortly before this the family was told her cancer had returned, meaning she had to restart treatment. Her mother Marie, 51, said it \"ripped her heart out\" to have to tell her daughter the news. They also had to find a suitable bone marrow donor \"ideally within two to three weeks\" for a transplant, which NUH said \"offers the highest chance of a cure\". This search was made more difficult by the coronavirus crisis as new sign-ups have dropped significantly, according to blood cancer charities. Now a match has now been found, Amy is due to have a transplant at Sheffield Children's Hospital in September. Her father described it as a \"game-changer\" and urged others to sign up to donate.

Ms Sturgeon also said more financial support was necessary to cushion the impact on businesses. It comes as the chancellor prepares to unveil plans to minimise job losses as new Covid restrictions come into force. Rishi Sunak is expected to replace the furlough scheme, which is set to expire next month.. In July, about 700,000 workers in Scotland, many in the hospitality sector, were still receiving some or all of their income through the scheme. The Scottish government has already gone further than the Westminster government in introducing restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, by banning different households from meeting inside their homes. As in other parts of the UK, a 22:00 \"curfew\" for bars and restaurants will be introduced in Scotland later this week - but at her daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon hinted she believed this did not go far enough. 'Considerable force' She said if more money had been available to help the hospitality sector it was \"likely\" she would have come to a \"different decision\". In her letter to the prime minister, she said the collective agreement to drive down Covid to the lowest possible level was \"particularly welcome\". But she continued: \"While all four governments announced new restrictions yesterday, there is clearly a significant strand of scientific opinion to the effect that bringing R back below one and the virus back under control will require measures beyond those which any of us have so far announced. \"In my view, there is considerable force in that opinion.\" Ms Sturgeon said experience from earlier this year had shown how essential acting \"quickly and decisively\" against the virus had been. \"In other words, if we believe further action will be required there is nothing to be gained - and potentially much to be lost, including lives - from delay.\" Ms Sturgeon said the four nations should disc\n\nSummary:","79":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Some women with the implants, which are used to ease incontinence, have suffered painful complications. Members of the petitions committee now want a chamber debate on the matter. They also want the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which is carrying out an investigation into the use of mesh implants, to appear before MSPs. In addition, the committee is keen for the new health secretary to answer its questions. 'Dramatic obstacle' Petitions committee member, Jackson Carlow, said that while he had been \"enormously encouraged\" by Mr Neil's call to stop use of the implants he was \"disturbed\" that some health boards had not halted the procedure. He said he was also worried that the MHRA was set to recommend that the benefits of the operation outweighed the risk. Mr Carlow said: \"They have come to that conclusion despite the fact there is evidence of under reporting and there are concerns that the MHRA is not aware of all women who have experienced problems. \"This seems to me to be potentially quite a dramatic obstacle to what many of us thought was progress.\" He added that what was seen by the committee as \"tremendous progress\" could be \"going into reverse\". The MHRA had said its research showed that while a small number of women had experienced distressing effects, the benefits of the tapes and meshes \"outweighed the risks\" and could help in dealing with upsetting conditions such as urinary stress incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.

I am like a brutally wounded bird without wings,\" he told the judge as the convicted men sat in the dock. \"My view is that such criminals should not be let outside of the prison for the rest of their lives to prevent such a crime reoccurring, to set an example of intolerance of such inhumane crimes and, as a result, to keep our society safe. Dr Taufiq, a paediatric neurosurgeon, continued: \"The fire has stolen everything from me. \"I have lost my soul-mate, my confidante and my best friends.

Those on the party's left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worrying whether the party's positioning on the issue is right. Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir's call for any council tax increases to be scrapped. But in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families. And in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives. Now one thing that unites all three former shadow ministers was their dismissal from the frontbench when Sir Keir assumed the leadership. The left of the party have been increasingly critical of Sir Keir - especially over the suspension of former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But they are now becoming more vocal on policy and positioning rather than personalities. There are now concerns that as the country emerges from the pandemic, some of the radical policies on which Sir Keir was elected by his membership - including increasing taxes on the better off - will be diluted. Some of those who know the Labour leader well suggest that these concerns are misplaced. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has signalled that Labour is open to increasing taxes on business in future. More immediately, the relatively new Labour leadership want to prove their pro-business credentials and to give a clear, unmuddied message that securing the recovery is the party's priority. Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett say they have consulted more than 1,000 activists and are giving the grassroots a voice.

The implants were commonly used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth. The case is one of a series of lawsuits J&J faces over the products. Some patients said they had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted. Judge Anna Katzmann ruled that much of the information the company provided about the products was \"inaccurate\" and at times made \"false representations\". \"The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon's own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated,\" Ms Katzmann said in her ruling. The court will set damages next year. In a statement, Ethicon defended its record and said it would consider an appeal. \"Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products,\" the company said. Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, welcomed the decision. \"They have treated women essentially like guinea pigs, lied about it and done nothing to help,\" she told reporters outside the court in Sydney. Last year, the Australian government issued a national apology to women affected by vaginal mesh, acknowledging decades of \"agony and pain\". Mounting lawsuits The ruling is the latest bad news for J&J, which is facing billions of dollars in legal claims over other products, including opioids.

New MEPs were elected in 61% of seats, he said, marking a \"fundamental shift\". He called on EU leaders to allow Michel Barnier to negotiate in a way that finds \"common ground\" with the UK. Brussels has consistently insisted that the withdrawal agreement - one of two main elements of Theresa May's Brexit deal, which was resoundingly rejected by MPs - cannot be renegotiated. Mr Barclay said Mr Barnier had told him in their discussion last week that he is bound by the instructions given to him by the European Commission and leaders of member states. But the change in the EU Parliament means there is a need for the EU to alter its approach, Mr Barclay said. \"Mr Barnier needs to urge EU leaders to consider this if they too want an agreement, to enable him to negotiate in a way that finds common ground with the UK. Otherwise, no deal is coming down the tracks,\" he said. By contrast, Boris Johnson's appointment as prime minister strengthened the UK's mandate to leave on 31 October, he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ramped up his rhetoric over his desire to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October, as part of his \"do or die\" commitment.

Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told Mr Johnson this week \"the backstop was necessary as a consequence of decisions taken in the UK\".

Mr Sheridan has been faithfully following the club for 96 years. He said: \"The icing on the cake will be when we beat Crystal Palace.\" Representatives from the club paid a surprise visit to Mr Sheridan at The Tithebarn care home in Great Crosby, Sefton, Merseyside, this week to present him with his birthday gifts. They included a shirt with the number \"104\" printed on the back, a cake and the letter from Klopp thanking him for his support since 1923. Mr Sheridan, who has seven grandchildren and fourteen great-grandchildren, will attend the match with family, including a son who is travelling to Liverpool from Canada. He began watching Liverpool and local rivals Everton in 1923 when an uncle started taking him to games on the tram from their home in Wavertree each week and a love affair with the Reds soon formed. Mr Sheridan added: \"I've been a proud Liverpool supporter since I was a boy and have supported the club through thick and thin, so I'm absolutely thrilled to be off to the match on Saturday.\"\n\nSummary:","91":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The city observed a minute's silence at noon (10:00 GMT) in memory of those who died trying to escape. Soldiers from the East began construction on the morning of 13 August 1961. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says the East German authorities portrayed the Wall as a barrier to keep the fascist West out - what came to be known as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart. But he says the accepted view now is that it was to keep East German potential migrants in. 'Saddest day' Addressing the ceremony on Bernauer Street, famously divided by the Wall and now site of a memorial, Mayor Wowereit said the capital was remembering the \"saddest day in its recent history\". \"It is our common responsibility to keep alive the memories and pass them on to the next generation, to maintain freedom and democracy and to do everything so that such injustices may never happen again,\" he said. At a ceremony at a former crossing-point, President Wulff said the wall had been \"an expression of fear\" of those who created it. \"The world situation, of which this wall was a symbol, seemed irreversible to many people,\" he said. \"But this was not the case. In the end, freedom is unconquerable. No wall can survive the will for freedom in the long term. The violence of just a few has no hold over the drive for freedom of many.\" Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also attended the event, was herself raised in the East. The number of people who died trying to cross the Wall is disputed - at least 136 are known to have been killed but victims' groups say the true number is more than 700. The first victim was thought to be Guenter Litfin on 24 August 1961 and the last Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989. A list of names of the victims was read out overnight.

It was the last time anyone reported seeing the 17-year-old. West Midlands Police said it was investigating after a man in France called them with information. Det Sgt Matt Morgan said he received the call after the force made the renewed appeal on Monday.

Police searched land in Wombourne, south Staffordshire, earlier this year after a tip-off but said the investigation remained a missing person inquiry.

It is \"a stunning show\" that takes the audience on \"extraordinary journey\", according to The Guardian. The Stage and The Times also gave out maximum stars, the latter billing it as \"nothing less than awe-inspiring\". The newspaper's review, by critic Ann Treneman, concluded: \"Roar it out: this is a hit.\" The Daily Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish, meanwhile, declared it \"a worthy successor to War Horse\". He wrote: \"We've been waiting a while for the 'next' War Horse - a theatrical phenomenon that can hold a family audience spell-bound, spur the imagination and make the heart race... It looks as though that moment has arrived.\" Cavendish awarded the play four stars, and said that if there's a shortcoming, \"it's that it leaves you craving more\". Martel's Booker Prize-winning novel told the story of a 16-year-old Indian boy who sets off to emigrate with his family, but becomes trapped on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a tiger for company. It was adapted for the big screen in 2012 in a film directed by Ang Lee, which won the filmmaker one of four Oscars. The Guardian's Mark Fisher described the way the new stage show switches between settings as \"a triumph of transformative stagecraft\", and praised Hiran Abeysekera's \"superb central performance\". \"If it underplays the novel's tone of helpless desperation, boredom and privation, it nonetheless does tremendous justice to the author's imaginative canvas,\" he wrote. In his five-star WhatsOnStage review, Ron Simpson wrote that everything in director Max Webster and playwright Lolita Chakrabarti's \"shrewd and sensitive adaptation works perfectly and much of it astonishes\".

The entertainment big-hitters went head to head from 20.00 BST. The X Factor launched last weekend, watched by an average of 9.3m, as Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and Simon Cowell re-joined the judging panel. The ITV show's viewing figures do not include those for their ITV+1 channel and the BBC figures do not include those catching up on the BBC iPlayer via tablets or computers. Saturday's edition of The X Factor was watched by an average of 8.7 million people, according to overnight ratings. On Sunday, Strictly went out from 20.00-21.15 while The X Factor aired from 20.00-21.05. It marks the first time in several years that the two have clashed. Quoting the peak audience figures, Cowell tweeted: \"So the numbers are in. Strictly peak 9.4. X Factor peak 9.2. Round one to them. Such a shame they were both on at the same time!\" The BBC said the overlap was unavoidable because it had scheduled Strictly to avoid clashing with an extra edition of Coronation Street. Cowell criticised the BBC's decision last month, saying it would only hurt the viewers. He said: \"They say this isn't a ratings battle, it is, that's why they did it. They didn't have to put it on at the same time as us, they did and it means that people then have to make the choice, where before I think it was more of a gentlemen's type agreement. But it just shows, as far as I'm concerned, this is personally speaking, the producers of the show for what they are. \"They don't want this show to do well, they don't want people to watch it, and our job is to do the best job we can so people prefer X Factor to them.\" Sir Bruce Forsyth took part in a special routine on Sunday's Strictly Come Dancing to mark his departure as one of the show's main hosts.

She also said she would not seek re-election as leader of the centre-right CDU party in December. She has held the post since 2000. The CDU was severely weakened in Sunday's poll in the state of Hesse, the latest in a series of setbacks. Both the CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, were 10 percentage points down on the previous poll there. The election comes just weeks after Mrs Merkel's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, suffered huge losses in a state parliament vote. Parties like the left-leaning Greens and the far-right, anti-immigration AfD have grown in national support following the 2017 general election, as backing for the major centre parties has waned. Merkel's long goodbye By Jenny Hill, BBC's Berlin correspondent Angela Merkel did her best to maintain her famous poker face but at times she looked rather sad as she announced what amounted to an official - albeit drawn-out - farewell to German politics. She has always insisted that if she is to lead Germany, she must also lead her party. The announcement is intended to silence critics in her party and win back the voters who have deserted the CDU in favour of parties like AfD and the Greens, but it also reflects her dwindling grip on power. Much depends on her successor as party leader. If it is a loyalist - like Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer - Germany might see a smooth transition to a new chancellor, possibly allowing Mrs Merkel to see out her term. But the vultures are circling. Already an old rival, Friedrich Merz, has announced his candidacy. If one of Mrs Merkel's adversaries prevails as party leader, her chancellorship becomes uncomfortable and possibly untenable. What did Mrs Merkel say? Mrs Merkel said she took \"full responsibility\" for poor performance. \"As chancellor and leader of the CDU I'm politically responsible for everything, for successes and for failures,\" she said. \"\n\nSummary:","96":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

This is what we have learnt. The rocket is enormous Many observers have been struck by the missile's vast size - this undated picture released by state media of Mr Kim dwarfed by the rocket he is inspecting gives an idea of its scale. Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, noted that the missile was much bigger than its previous iteration the Hwasong-14, and added: \"Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club.\" Some have also noted that the rocket appears to have more sophisticated steering and thrusters. The \"new, more capable missile\" seems to have a more powerful propulsion system with two main engines and looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant, David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists told Reuters news agency. It also has a larger and blunter nose cone, which could mean it can carry a \"super-large heavy\" nuclear warhead on its tip, as Pyongyang claims. All this means that the missile appears capable of transporting a nuclear warhead for a long distance and possibly surviving atmospheric re-entry. North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is a viable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). There is a new transporter Photos and videos also appeared to show the missile launching from a platform, and not from a mobile launcher which North Korea has used in previous missile tests. A large nine-axle vehicle transported the rocket to the site. Analysts believe this arrangement was due to the missile's large size, and means it needs more time to launch. In a situation when snap responses need to be made, \"this makes a big difference during crises,\" said NK Pro analyst Scott LaFoy.

The faults also meant only a simplified version of the BBC's homepage was shown, while online video and audio clips were also disrupted. A BBC spokesman said it was \"pretty confident\" the faults were now cleared. \"BBC iPlayer, BBC iPlayer Radio and other parts of BBC Online that were affected by problems over the weekend are now up and running,\" he said. \"Our teams continue to investigate the problem to ensure this doesn't happen again.\" He added: \"We will be publishing more details about the problem in due course on the BBC's internet blog.\" The duration of the outage led reporters to question BBC boss Tony Hall about the problems on a day when the corporation unveiled its annual report. Mr Hall said that he would look into the cause of the problems and added: \"99.9% of the time the iPlayer works very well\". Internal investigation While the iPlayer was not working the corporation put out statements via Twitter apologising several times for the inconvenience. The apology did not mollify many people who strongly criticised the BBC about the length of the disruption. The problems for the iPlayer and many other sites started on the morning of 19 July when engineers noticed that there was a \"severe load\" on the servers underlying the video-on-demand system. In addition, reports reached the BBC that viewers were getting slow response times for some services or were seeing errors saying a programme or clip was not available. Soon after the BBC noticed, messages were also received from network engineers at internet service providers (ISPs) including Virgin Media, which were also logging problems with the iPlayer and other BBC video traffic.

The BRC\/KPMG survey found shoppers held back in the hope of big discounts on Black Friday, 28 November. But in the event, many retailers did not make the discounts that shoppers had been hoping for. David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said: \"November's relatively flat sales figures are a reality check for the retail sector with consumers holding off for a Black Friday bargain pitted against retailers determined to hold onto their hard-earned margins. \"Despite the hype around Black Friday, there was minimal loosening of the family purse strings compared to last year.\" Total sales across all stores increased by just 0.7%, compared with a rise of 2.2% last year. However, online sales of non-food item outperformed, up 11.8% on last year. 'Omni-channel' shopping Black Friday produced the expected spike in sales, with trading up 25% compared with the beginning of the month. Sales in furniture, and large and small electrical appliances, were higher than last year. However, the BRC said an increase in \"omni-channel\" shopping, with consumers using a mix of online and in-store purchases. made it hard to know how and when people would spend their money in the crucial Christmas shopping period.

It was passed unanimously by Welsh assembly members after being proposed by Labour backbencher Ann Jones. She said the legislation would save lives and showed how devolution could make a positive difference. Law-making powers were drawn down from Westminster for the legislation. Appealing for AMs' support in the Senedd on Wednesday, Vale of Clwyd AM Ms Jones said: \"The times I have had to say to people a sprinkler system will not go off unless there is a fire at 68C. \"It won't go off if you burn your toast. It won't go off if the pizza's burning. It will only go off when there is a fire and when it goes off that saves those lives. \"It saves the lives of the people, it saves the lives of firefighters having to go into burning buildings and it just makes sense to get on and do it now.\" She added that sprinklers had been in existence since 1885. The building industry had its chance to fit sprinklers in all new homes, but it was now time to legislate \"so we can make people's lives in Wales a lot safer\", she said. Speaking after the legislation was passed, she said: \"Not many of the votes we pass here save lives - that one did.\" The measure was backed by Wales' three fire and rescue services, the Chief Fire Officers Association (UK), the Fire Brigades Union and many sprinkler campaigners, including the National Fire Sprinkler Network.

Dr Raghib Ali suggested it was time to stop using ethnicity when deciding who needed help. He said focusing on factors like jobs and housing would help more people. The newly appointed expert adviser said this approach would help prevent everyone at risk - including poorer white groups living in crowded housing - from missing out on help. But Dr Chris Udenze, a GP who has also worked in public health, said it was important not to dismiss ethnicity. He told the BBC: \"I think the whole thing is very complicated. Ethnicity is not the only factor but it is definitely one of many factors. \"All the other factors such socioeconomic factors, diabetes etc are important but even if you were able to take these away, there is still a disparity. Ethnicity is still a relevant factor and not paying attention to this will not help communities vulnerable to Covid.\" He added: \"Similarly, structural racism may not be a reasonable explanation by itself but it is one of many factors that contributes to disparity and this has been backed up by many reports. Dr Ali made his comments during a briefing on the first quarterly report on Covid disparities, led by the government's Race Disparity Unit and the Minister for Equalities, Kemi Badenoch. The document is a stocktake of the actions taken and evidence gathered since previous analyses by Public Health England, which set out the greater risks faced by black, Asian and other ethnic minority groups.

He said it would be \"wrong to commemorate those displays\", adding: \"Indeed, they should be condemned.\" The 2001 conference was dominated by angry confrontations over Israel. The eight-day event in Durban was originally designed to produce a show of international unity on the issue of racism, but it was overshadowed by rows about the Middle East conflict and the wording of a draft final document. The United States and Canada refused to send high-level representatives, objecting to what they saw as anti-Semitic language in the draft text, which tried to define Zionism as racism. Even after those words were removed, there was further controversy as Arab states pressed for condemnation of Israel's practices towards the Palestinians.

Her father became the lead plaintiff in a case by families that argued that the idea of \"separate but equal\" violated African-American civil rights. The 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling struck down legal segregation in US schools. Despite living just a few streets away from Sumner Elementary School, Linda was turned away and told to enrol in African-American school, two miles away. As a nine-year-old, it meant crossing train tracks and getting a bus alone. Her father, Oliver Brown, became one of 13 plaintiffs to bring a lawsuit against the Topeka Board of Education. The case was initially struck down, but he later joined a national legal challenge by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) on behalf of families from several states. They hoped to overturn the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson ruling which legally sanctioned the idea of racially segregated facilities. Civil rights activists argued that it was discriminatory because African-American schools often had poorer facilities. In a 1985 interview Ms Brown said her father took up the challenge because he \"felt that it was wrong for black people to have to accept second-class citizenship\". The NAACP case was led by lawyer Thurgood Marshall, who would later become the first black Supreme Court justice. In 1954 the court unanimously ruled that segregated schools were \"inherently unequal\" and had a \"detrimental effect\" on African-American children.

In a statement, BBC World Service Director Jamie Angus said Shah had been a \"respected and popular\" journalist. \"This is a devastating loss and I send my sincere condolences to Ahmad Shah's friends and family and the whole BBC News Afghan team,\" he said. \"We are doing all we can to support his family at this very difficult time.\" Khost police chief Abdul Hanan told BBC Afghan that Shah had been shot by unidentified armed men. He said police were investigating the motive. Locals told the BBC that Shah had been on his bicycle when the attack happened. He was then taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries. He was in a normally safe area he was familiar with when the attack happened, the BBC's News and Current Affairs Director Fran Unsworth said. Last year, Afghanistan was ranked the third most dangerous country in the world for journalists by Reporters without Borders. It said nine journalists had been killed in three separate attacks. Shah is the fifth BBC staff member to have been killed in Afghanistan since the country's devastating civil war in the 1990s. The others are: Khost, where the attack happened, borders Pakistan and was an important theatre in the conflict with militants after US-led forces invaded Afghanistan in 2001. The Taliban still has a presence in parts of the province but attacks are rare now. Elsewhere in Afghanistan, 26 people were killed in two bombings in the capital, Kabul. Nine journalists and photographers, and four police officers, were among those killed, officials say. Some 45 people were reported injured in the attacks. The first explosion was carried out by an attacker on a motorbike. A second followed about 15 minutes later after a crowd, including several reporters, had gathered at the scene.

The Hong Kong government and the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) told the BBC they were investigating. The DVLA said work was already under way to tighten the law on standards required for drivers who exchange foreign licences. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, is calling for an urgent review. \"This is deeply disturbing. It means there are people driving on our roads who have not passed a UK driving test that is recognised by the UK authorities,\" said Ms Ellman. \"That means people's lives may be at risk and it is an extremely disturbing situation - it shouldn't be allowed to happen.\" Nationals from India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Malaysia, the USA, Israel and China are among those the UK government does not permit to swap their foreign licences automatically into a full UK licence without a test. Motorists from all countries are allowed to drive in the UK for a year before being required to take a driving test if they do not qualify for an immediate swap of their foreign licence. 'Very worried' An investigation for BBC London's Inside Out programme revealed agents in the capital are arranging to swap foreign licences into UK ones via a Hong Kong licence, which the UK does accept automatically, to bypass the rules. The BBC tracked down the original applications and found fraudulent details used as proof of address in Hong Kong and fake addresses scrawled on envelopes. Hong Kong based lawyer Raymond Tse, who is experienced in civil, criminal litigation and transport issues, said: \"My reaction is that the Hong Kong transport department has been used or manipulated. \"If the driving licence in Hong Kong, which is not an identity, can be converted to such an important identity document in the UK t\n\nSummary:","109":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Earlier this week, police used water cannon to disperse demonstrators and there have been scuffles as officers tried to clear small tented camps set up by protestors. Last night, a Porsche garage was torched. On Thursday night a huge demonstration is planned. On Friday, protesters aim to stop world leaders getting into the summit. At Hamburg's police headquarters, there is an atmosphere of nervous tension. Teams of officers in minibuses drive in and out past lines of water cannon and police vans, parked up and ready for action. About 20,000 officers are on duty over the course of G20. The police, it seems, are taking no chances. They say up to 8,000 extremists, armed with home-made weapons, are targeting the city. \"Some of these militants will be very aggressive,\" said Ralf Martin Meyer, the chief of Hamburg police. \"In the last few days we've seized improvised weapons like slingshots, ball bearings and fire extinguishers filled with flammable liquid which were intended for use against police officers. \"The amount of tools and weapons we found make us very concerned.\" The police operation has divided opinion in Germany. Too many officers, too heavy handed, say those worried that the decision to seal off part of the city centre and keep protesters out is an infringement of Germans' right to peaceful protest. As mounted units patrol the area around the summit hall and workers in orange overalls use forklift trucks to place concrete blocks along the pavement, many question the wisdom of holding an event like this in a congested city centre. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel proposed that G20 summits should held regularly in the United Nations building in New York instead of being hosted by the country which holds the rotating presidency, citing high costs - suspected to be at least \u20ac150m (\u00a3130m) - and security concerns.

Mr Actie denied a second accusation at Swansea Crown Court that he used his compensation to bribe witnesses in the trial of eight ex-police officers. The officers deny perverting the course of justice and the trial continues. Miss White, a prostitute, was stabbed more than 50 times in her Cardiff flat on Valentine's Day, 1988. Mr Actie, his cousin Ronnie Actie, Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Tony Paris became known as the Cardiff Five when they went on trial in 1990 for the murder of Miss White. Mr Miller, Mr Abdullahi and Mr Paris were convicted and jailed for life but released in 1992 when the Court of Appeal quashed their convictions. John and Ronnie Actie were acquitted, after spending two years in jail awaiting trial. Mr Actie was awarded \u00a3300,000 compensation. The three surviving members of the Cardiff Five are giving evidence against eight of the former police officers who helped prepare the case against them. In 2003, advances in DNA led new officers to Jeffrey Gafoor, who admitted the murder and said he had acted alone. He is serving a life sentence. Mr Actie was further cross examined on Thursday by William Coker QC, the barrister representing former Det Ch Insp Graham Mouncher, who led the murder investigation in late 1988. Mr Coker asked Mr Actie if he knew anything about Miss White taking drugs or about debts she may have had to a dealer. Mr Actie replied: \"No.\" He had previously told the jury he had only been on \"nodding terms\" with her. He also denied putting pressure on Gafoor to accept sole responsibility for her murder, prompting Mr Coker to claim: \"You were covering up in 1990 and you are still hiding something today.\" He said: \"You know a great deal more about that night than you are prepared to say.

But the sci-fi, starring Anne Hathaway and Matthew McConaughey, took first place in the global box office rundown. Ouija and Nightcrawler, last week's joint number one, fell to four and six. It is only the fourth time in US box office history that two films have opened with $50m or above, according to experts Rentrak. Senior analyst Paul Dergarabedian said that Big Hero 6 and Interstellar \"were both able to do well without cannibalising each other's audiences\". \"It's a perfect example of counterprogramming. It paid off for the industry, and it just doesn't happen that often,\" he added. Despite that, Mr Dergarabedian said the US box office had slipped 7% compared to the same weekend last year. Interstellar, the latest film by Dark Knight and Inception director Christopher Nolan, which tells the story of astronauts who are searching for a habitable planet after the Earth is decimated by dust storms, cost $165m (\u00a3103m) to make. It has inevitably been compared to last year's starry space epic Gravity, which had a bigger box office haul in its opening week. The movie is likely to enjoy a further worldwide sales boost when it opens in China on Wednesday, while its makers have said they will target families and young men in a bid to sustain its ticket sales.

But in a shocking about-turn in November, federal investigators said the teenagers took their own lives. On Thursday, the girls' families challenged the investigators' report in the district court in Badaun in northern India, demanding further investigations in the case. BBC Hindi's Ankur Jain tries to find answers to the mysterious deaths in the village of Katra Sahadatganj. The village Katra Sahadatganj is a nondescript village of 4,000 people in northern Uttar Pradesh state. It is mostly inhabited by small farmers and landless farm labourers. There are no lavatories at home and women have to go to the open fields before sunrise and after sunset to relieve themselves. On the night of 27 May, the girls left home at around 8pm, saying they were going to the toilet. A search party looked for them for several hours but could not find them. Later that night, the lower-caste cousins, aged about 12 and 14, were found hanging from a tree. Three brothers, belonging to a somewhat higher caste, were accused of gang rape and murder and arrested, but were freed on bail in September after federal investigators said new forensic tests had concluded the girls were not sexually assaulted. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) says the elder girl had \"an intimate relationship\" with the main accused Pappu Yadav and her younger cousin was \"facilitating the relationship\". The girls killed themselves because they were afraid of facing their families after they were discovered by Nazru, a neighbour who is also the main witness in the case, the CBI adds. Few in the village are convinced by the CBI's suicide story - rights groups have called it a partisan investigation and the girls' families have rejected the findings.

In response, the UN's chief said it was \"not the time\" to cut funds to the WHO. Mr Trump has been under fire for his own handling of the pandemic. He has sought to deflect persistent criticism that he acted too slowly to stop the virus's spread by pointing to his decision in late January to place restrictions on travel from China. He has accused the WHO of having \"criticised\" that decision and of being biased towards China more generally. \"I am directing my administration to halt funding while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization's role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,\" Mr Trump told a news conference at the White House on Tuesday. The US is the global health body's largest single funder and gave it more than $400m in 2019. A decision on whether the US resumes funding will be made after the review, which Mr Trump said would last 60 to 90 days. The WHO is yet to directly respond but UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the international community should be uniting \"in solidarity to stop this virus\". \"It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world's efforts to win the war against Covid-19,\" he said.

Launched last year on the back of its UK City of Culture bid, this time around it will be an online event. Among those taking part are Douglas Stuart, Chris Brookmyre and Dr Marisa Haetzman. Organisers said they had been lucky to be one of the few cultural events to take place before lockdown last year. They said that because they were \"such a young festival\" they had been ready to \"embrace new ideas and opportunities\" with their digital event which has seen thousands of free tickets distributed. Edinburgh International Book Festival is physically on the move this year - after a digital edition last year - to Edinburgh College of Art. It has said that with ticket sales impossible to estimate for August it could not justify the costs of tents and infrastructure at its old home on Charlotte Square Gardens. It is yet to decide fully on the format this time around but will definitely retain digital elements. \"It is far too early to say whether we will be permitted to have in-person audiences at events this year,\" said a spokesperson. However, \"if rules allow\" its new home could offer the \"oasis of calm\" for which the festival said it was known.

The union said the document \"ignores reality in favour of austerity\". LU said the document was a discussion paper and did not represent any agreed proposals. 'Recruitment freeze' The confidential document called Operational Strategy Discussion Paper and dated July 2011, looks at how the service will evolve over the next decade and examines \"reducing operational costs by up to 20%\". It predicts the closure of most ticket offices by 2016 as more people use contact-less bank cards or Oyster smartcards to pay for their journeys. Across London 30 ticket offices will remain which will become \"travel centres\", the paper says. The strategy document predicts that by 2017 only 20% of trains will be manually operated with drivers in cabs, and beyond 2020 all lines are expected to have \"fully remote train operations\". There are also mentions of a recruitment freeze and \"imposing\" overtime and part-time working.

It is opposing a legal challenge, from environmentalist Chris Murphy, to the proposed route of the A6 at Toome in County Antrim. The new A6 passes close to Lough Beg, a protected wetland which is an important habitat for overwintering swans. However, the lawyer said it did not \"traverse the defined boundaries\" of the protected area. Compensation He added court that survey work done after the building of the existing A6 showed swans foraging \"right up to the road\". \"It's people that disturb swans, not cars,\" he said. The department's lawyer added that the proposed new dual carriageway had a relatively small impact on the foraging grounds for swans and that they regularly changed where they fed. Earlier the court heard 133 landowners have had their ground vested along the proposed route. The department has already bought the land and agreed compensation. As Mr Murphy was not seeking the quashing of the vesting orders, if he won, the department would be left with the land and the compensation bill. This, the lawyer said, would be a \"severe potential public prejudice\" not just to the public purse but to landowners who had not opposed the vesting orders.\n\nSummary:","119":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He was China's longest-serving wrongfully convicted inmate, after having served 9,778 days in the prison in Jiangxi province. Prosecutors who reopened the case said his confession had inconsistencies and did not match the original crime. He walked free after a high court found there was not enough evidence to justify his conviction. Observers say China is growing more willing to quash wrongful convictions, but only criminal not political. Footage on Chinese media showed Mr Zhang in an emotional reunion with his 83-year-old mother and his ex-wife following his release on Tuesday. China cracks down on forced confessions Analysis by Celia Hatton, BBC World Service Asia-Pacific editor It is an open secret in China that the police use various kinds of torture, including sleep deprivation, cigarette burns and beatings, to force suspects to confess to crimes. In the past, entire cases might then be pinned on that \"confession\". In 2010, a serious effort began in China's legal system to stamp out the use of forced confessions. Death sentences must now be approved by China's Supreme Court and there is a growing drive to eliminate cases that are pinned solely on a suspect's confession. However, China's legal reform has clear limits. Police in many provinces remain under heavy pressure to \"solve\" cases, often by producing suspects and there is little appetite to improve the treatment of dissidents and some ethnic minorities, including Muslim Uighurs. The authorities regularly detain individuals in politically sensitive cases and interrogate them outside of the normal detention system. Behind those closed doors, almost anything can happen. It is far more likely that China will reform its treatment of criminal suspects than those who appear to threaten the dominance of the Communist Party.

Downing Street later sought to dampen down the speculation, insisting current government policy had not changed. And MPs rejected a Labour motion urging immediate change by a majority of 14. The government won the vote on the issue, the first of the new Parliament, by 323 votes to 309. Labour's amendment to the Queen's Speech, which also called for an end to cuts to the police and emergency services, was defeated as the Conservatives and all 10 DUP MPs joined forces to oppose it - for the first time since the two parties announced a parliamentary pact. Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. Labour says its motion was a litmus test of MPs' willingness to oppose further austerity measures and the Conservatives had acted as if it was \"business as usual\". \"Although government ministers said they had learned the lessons of the general election and were listening to voters, it is clear that nothing has changed,\" Jeremy Corbyn said. Before the vote, several Conservative MPs called for the cap to be lifted.

The president acknowledged the more than five million young men and women who joined the military since 9\/11 to \"defend our country against barbaric forces of evil and destruction\". \"We are making plain to these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large Earth,\" he continued.

Struck but not remotely surprised. In the short-term, it is hard to see the events of the past week as anything other than deeply damaging for the SNP. In the short-term - but perhaps also in the medium-term too. The police say they are at an early stage in their inquiries into the complaints lodged against Mr Salmond. The Court of Session, entirely rightly and admirably, tends to focus upon precision and justice, rather than the speedy remedy of controversy in the political world. Mr Salmond and his supporters hope there will be a relatively timeous resolution of his case against the procedure followed by the Scottish government in handling the complaints against him. But that will not be tomorrow, nor next week, nor perhaps before the end of the year. So, as one senior figure put it to me, the danger for the SNP is \"drift\" - a lack of focus, a decline in morale. Just when the party needs to be at its sharpest for Brexit and, perhaps, perhaps, an independence referendum to come. Rival parties are, of course, seizing upon the SNP's troubles, albeit within limits. Today, for example, Jackson Carlaw, the deputy leader of the Scottish Conservatives, called upon the SNP to \"focus on governing the country\". In one sense, of course, this is merely an amplification of the Tory argument that Nicola Sturgeon should stick to the day job. And one understands Mr Carlaw's stance. He has a decided knack for getting to the core of events. But perhaps, deploying his familiar irony, Mr Carlaw might privately concede that his comments sit just a fraction uncomfortably with the reality of governance at the UK level in these Brexit days.

He is alleged to have pocketed A$500,000 (\u00a3280,000; $378,000). During the raids, detectives seized A$12,000 in cash, as well as documentation and electronic devices, the police said in a statement. Inquiries revealed that the suspect received information relating to allegedly fixed table tennis matches in Europe, the police added. He was granted bail, and is now due to appear in court on 28 January. The police have not named the suspect, but Australian media have reported that it is former professional table tennis player Adam Green. Media reports say police were alerted earlier this year by bookmakers about potential suspicious betting activity regarding table tennis competitions in Europe, particularly in Ukraine. Betting agencies say more and more punters have been betting on table tennis since the coronavirus pandemic put paid to most conventional sporting events.\n\nSummary:","125":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

While they do not recommend a vote either way, peers say trade deals between the EU and non-EU states take between four and nine years on average. Leave campaigners argue a UK-EU Treaty should be wrapped up in two years. A separate report from Oxford University's Migration Observatory, also published on Wednesday, suggests curbs on in-work benefits for EU citizens negotiated by David Cameron are unlikely to result in a large reduction in migration to the UK. It said a \"large majority\" of recent EU migrants were not claiming benefits of any kind. If the UK voted to leave in the referendum on 23 June, it would not mean an immediate exit from the EU. The prime minister could trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides for a two-year process for negotiating the terms of withdrawal and a departing state's future relations with the EU. But there is some debate as to whether this is the best method for leaving the EU and whether it should happen immediately after the vote. The cross-party committee warned that negotiations for withdrawal and to establish a new relationship with the EU would take longer than the two years allowed under Article 50. The committee, which took evidence from two EU law experts, said one of the most complex parts of the talks would be establishing the rights of UK citizens resident in other member states to access health care, schooling and employment. The negotiations, it added, would also have to deal with the reciprocal rights of EU nationals living in the UK. 'Torpedoes claims' \"We don't take a view on whether the UK should leave the EU or not,\" said Lord Boswell, the former Conservative minister who chairs the committee. \"But it is clear that if that's what people decide, withdrawal would mean difficult and lengthy negotiations.\" \"It's not possible to predict exactly how long it wou\n\nSummary:","126":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He said, in comments first reported by the BBC's Pallab Ghosh, that physics was \"becoming sexist against men\". Cern said on Monday it was suspending Prof Strumia pending an investigation. It stated that his presentation was \"unacceptable\". \"Cern always strives to carry out its scientific mission in a peaceful and inclusive environment,\" the statement reads, calling the presentation \"contrary to the Cern Code of Conduct\". The organisation said it was \"unfortunate\" the views of the scientist, who works at a collaborating university, \"risks overshadowing the important message and achievements of the event\". Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics. He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results \"proved\" that \"physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside\". He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: \"People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so.\" Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed that unconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research.

From Monday, non-contact sports such as golf and tennis can resume, with training sessions in other sports for those under-18 allowed in groups of 15. Fully vaccinated people will also be allowed indoor visits with one other fully vaccinated household. Dance classes will be permitted outdoors, while zoos, wildlife parks and heritage centres can reopen - but not amusement parks. The numbers allowed to attend funerals will increase from 10 to 25. The country, which is about a month behind Northern Ireland in its vaccination programme, has been in what's been described as the \"longest lockdown in the world\" and there is pressure to reopen society, particularly from the hospitality sector. The cabinet will meet later in the week to decide what further relaxations will happen and when. Barbers and hairdressers are not expected to reopen until the middle of May at the earliest, unlike Northern Ireland where they reopened on 23 April. It is also likely to be June before hotels, guest houses and B&Bs reopen. People are still being encouraged to work from home and are restricted to travel only within their own county or 20km (12.5 miles) from their home. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) M\u00edche\u00e1l Martin promised a major ramping up of the vaccination rollout in April, May and June, with an average of one million people getting a jab each month.

However, as of now, the programme has got nowhere near those targets.

Residents said dozens were rounded up and killed and livestock was stolen. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Sunday's attack in Guliso district, in the Oromia region, may have been identity-based. Ethnic violence has increased since Mr Abiy took office in April 2018, loosening controls in what had been a highly centralised state. \"Ethiopia's enemies are vowing either to rule the country or ruin it, and they are doing everything they can to achieve this. One of their tactics is to arm civilians and carry out barbaric attacks based on identity, [for me] this is heart breaking,\" Mr Abiy said in a Twitter post. What happened in the attack? Survivors counted 54 bodies in a school compound where the militants, who identified as OLA members, gathered people who did not manage to flee, mainly women, children and the elderly, and killed them, rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. A survivor told AFP news agency that security forces stationed in the area left and the OLA then rounded up civilians. \"After collecting us, they opened fire on us, and then afterwards looted cattle and burnt down houses,\" they said. The OLA is an armed group that has been blamed for kidnappings and bomb attacks in western and southern Ethiopia. The OLA broke off from the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) - an opposition party that spent years in exile and returned to the country after Mr Abiy took office in 2018. A local official told the BBC a team had been sent to Guliso district to investigate, anticipating the death toll could be \"high\". The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said up to 60 \"armed and unarmed assailants\" were involved in the attack, which was carried out on Sunday.

Twelve people were killed, including famous cartoonists. Five people died in a related attack in Paris days later. The attacks began a wave of jihadist strikes across France. The front cover of the latest edition features the 12 original cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which were published in a Danish newspaper before appearing in Charlie Hebdo. One of the cartoons shows the prophet wearing a bomb instead of a turban. The French headline reads \"Tout \u00e7a pour \u00e7a\" (\"All of that for this\"). In its editorial, the magazine says that it has often been asked to carry on printing caricatures of the prophet since the 2015 killings. \"We have always refused to do so, not because it is prohibited - the law allows us to do so - but because there was a need for a good reason to do it, a reason which has meaning and which brings something to the debate,\" it says. \"To reproduce these cartoons in the week the trial over the January 2015 terrorist attacks opens seemed essential to us.\" What's expected at the trial? Fourteen people are accused of obtaining weapons and providing logistical support for the attackers of Charlie Hebdo's Paris offices, and subsequent attacks on a Jewish supermarket and a police officer.

Lord Carloway said the court had to consider some extremely complex issues and a decision would take some time. The court had heard the prorogation of Parliament could begin on Monday. In London earlier, a legal challenge over the decision to suspend Parliament was rejected in the High Court. The case was brought by businesswoman Gina Miller, who argued the move was \"an unlawful abuse of power\". That decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. The judges in Edinburgh are considering an appeal against a ruling by Lord Doherty that the issue was for politicians and voters to judge, and not the courts. Aiden O'Neill QC, representing about 70 parliamentarians led by SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC who are challenging the UK government, had asked the judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh to \"hold the ring\" until next week, to prevent Parliament being suspended before their ruling. 'Attack on democracy' Earlier, he had argued that the suspension was unlawful. \"A decision to prorogue shuts down Parliament,\" he said. \"It is in those circumstances an attack on democracy. \"It is an attack on the balance of the constitution, and therefore is is unlawful.\" But David Johnston QC, representing the UK government, said it was not for the courts to get involved in what was a political decision.

Demonstrators gathered around Park Lane before setting off for Parliament Square. A rally also took place in York. An organiser of the London march, Keiran MacDermott, said protesters hoped to stop the government from triggering Article 50, which begins the formal process of the UK's withdrawal from the EU. Fellow organiser Mark Thomas, an activist, said he felt \"anger, frustration\" and a \"need to do something\". At the end of the two-mile route, protesters gathered in front of Parliament, and listened to speakers including Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, leftwing commentator and activist Owen Jones and musician Bob Geldof. Mr Geldof urged Remain campaigners to take to the streets, speak to their neighbours and work to stop the UK's exit from the EU. \"We need to individually organise ourselves.

The latest effort to combat the waiting list will see 1,000 extra tests per day added in September. Plans are also in place to minimise the disruption caused by industrial action planned for Friday. In June, the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) announced it would open some test centres on Sundays in a bid to tackle the backlog. Some drivers have been unable to secure an appointment until after their MOTs have expired, with some having to wait up to six weeks for a slot. Thirty new vehicle examiners have been hired and reminder letters are being sent out earlier to deal with the waits. The Department for Infrastructure told BBC News NI it was planning to add thousands of extra test slots. \"A further 9,000 appointments on Sundays and bank holidays in August will be made available, along with 1,000 additional tests per day from September\", a spokesperson said. \"However, we continue to have a significant number of customers failing to attend for their MOT test and we therefore encourage customers to either attend their pre-booked appointments or cancel them to allow others to make use of the appointment.\" In June 2,300 motorists failed to turn up for their tests. That accounted for about 3% of all scheduled tests. A DVA spokesperson said that in the 2018\/19 financial year, 32,000 customers did not attend their MOT appointments.

When the engineers returned on Friday it had opened up further and it was shut extremely quickly. Engineers feared a \"catastrophic failure\" of the structure. I'm told these bridges do not sag when they fail, they simply collapse. Even Transport for London (TfL) was only given 30 minutes' notice that it was shutting. The inspection of the viaduct, according to the Highways Agency, looked at 1,000 weld joints. Of those, 64 needed repairing with plates. The inspection team had carried out 52 by Sunday and are now working to finish the rest, including the new crack. What is uncertain is when it'll definitely be finished. Mike Penning, the Roads Minister, said it was \"highly possible\" it will be finished by Thursday. If it's not ready by then it will be a huge embarrassment as the Olympic family arrives on Monday and the M4 bus lane is meant to be reactivated by then. However, there will probably be weight restrictions on the viaduct in the short-term.\n\nSummary:","145":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Crown claimed ownership of the hoard, discovered by Reg Mead and Richard Miles in a Grouville field. The money will go towards restoration and to pay to have the hoard valued ahead of a purchase for the island. Jersey Heritage said the coins would go on display at the Jersey Museum next year along with exhibits from Guernsey, Brittany and Normandy. Treasury and Resources Minister, Senator Philip Ozouf, said: \"The coin hoard is also an exceptional opportunity and it would be unimaginable not to secure this treasure that is now such an important part of Jersey's heritage.\" A large mound containing about 70,000 coins was discovered last year by Reg Mead and Richard Miles. They began their hunt after a woman told them her father had found coins in a field some years before. Jersey Heritage Trust Conservator Neil Mahrer has spent the past year creating a model of the one-tonne mound of silver and copper coins, gold pieces and mud. The value of the hoard was estimated at up to \u00a310m when it was first removed from the ground. Work is now under way to prepare the coins already uncovered, and the replica made by Mr Mahrer, for an exhibition at Jersey Museum next year.\n\nSummary:","146":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But a lack of funding and little appetite for the genre among cinema audiences always seemed to be against him. Black Angel began life in the late 1970s when Christian's friend and Star Wars' creator George Lucas handed him the opportunity to turn his idea into a 25-minute short. Lucas's offer was in part a \"thank you\" for Christian's work on original Star Wars - A New Hope, for which Christian won one of his two Academy Awards for his set design. Pulling together a small production team and with a budget of just \u00a325,000, Christian headed to Scotland in the final months of 1979 to shoot the short. Black Angel is an Arthurian tale of a knight who rescues a princess while he is returning home from a campaign. The short film was made entirely in Scotland on a shoestring budget. The locations included Eilean Donan near Dornie, Bernera Barracks at Glenelg, Loch Eck in Argyll and a swimming pool in Dunoon, where underwater scenes were filmed. It was shown the following year in cinemas in the UK, Scandinavia, Japan and Australia as part of screenings of The Empire Strikes Back. Londoner Christian is now preparing to return to Scotland this autumn. And his old haunts of Eilean Donan, the wider Lochalsh area and also Skye are on his film location wish list. Most of the film is being made at a studio in Budapest in Hungary where Christian and his production team have been able to take advantage of incentives to keep costs down. But he said Black Angel cannot work without Scottish landscapes. \"I have to film in Scotland, and in late September and early October as I did the first time,\" says Christian. \"The quality of the natural light at that time of year in Scotland is like nothing else in the world. \"It allowed us to shoot scenes that would hav\n\nSummary:","147":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Currently some ships carrying freight have to rest on the seabed in the harbours when the tide is out.

Ideas explored in the document include moving the passenger terminal in St Peter Port, creating more parking on North Beach and a cruise liner berth. Mr Champion-Smith said: \"It would be great to achieve everything on the list and it would be great to go away and achieve that within five years - but it's economy driven.\" He said of a cruise liner berth: \"If the island finds itself in a cash-rich position and the capital expenditure makes sense in terms of a return and current demand as it either grows or declines... then it could be built.\" Mr Champion-Smith said work to improve some of the commercial areas of the harbours had already begun and would result in \"a safer working area and environment for everyone\".

There would be another, lower, limit of 20mg\/100ml for young drivers and people who earn their living from driving. Mr Attwood also wants to give police powers to randomly stop drivers without the need for reasonable suspicion. He also proposes, in certain circumstances, removing drivers' right to opt for a blood or urine sample instead of a breath test. Other plans include: The minister said that while much progress had been made towards eliminating a drink-drive culture, more work needed to be done. He said that over the past five years, 75 people had been killed and 463 seriously injured by drivers impaired on drink or drugs. \"This is totally unacceptable and I am determined to do what I can to tackle this issue once and for all,\" Mr Attwood added. \"I have listened to the public on this. There is widespread public support for a step change in how we deal with drink drivers and I believe that what I am proposing will make a real difference.\" Zero tolerance Such a change would put Northern Ireland on a different legal standing to the rest of the UK. However, there have recently been discussions about dropping the drink-driving limit in the Republic of Ireland.

Some of the countries have variations, with newly-qualified drivers in Spain having a lower limit. Julie Townsend, from the road safety charity Brake, said she welcomed the move and hoped the rest of the UK would follow suit. \"We actually want a zero tolerance approach to drink-driving,\" she said. \"We would like to see a 20mg limit across the UK and we have got evidence that the majority of drivers would actually support that tougher stance. \"And the reason we want a zero tolerance approach is that it sends out a very clear message that it's none for the road. \"You shouldn't be drinking e\n\nSummary:","149":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

They put the cost to the whole of the NHS from visitors and non-permanent residents who come from the European Economic Area (that's the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) at around \u00a3340m a year. That figure includes the cost of treatment received by so-called health tourists - people who visit the UK purely to use the health service. This is a relatively small proportion of the NHS total annual expenditure, which for England alone was \u00a3113.3bn in 2014\/15 What about EU citizens who live and work here? There aren't any figures for how much they cost the NHS. We do know there are around three million people from other EU countries resident in the UK and all are entitled to use NHS services. That definitely adds to demand. But those people would not be forced to leave the UK, even if the UK left the EU. No Leave politicians or campaigners have suggested that EU migrants already here should leave if the UK left the EU. And some lawyers argue that the Vienna Convention would let EU citizens settled in the UK and UK citizens living in other EU countries stay where they are, if the UK decided to leave the EU (although it's worth noting that two EU countries - France and Romania - are not signed up to the convention). How much leaving the EU would restrict future migration from the EU would depend on whatever deal the UK struck when it left the EU. If the UK were to retain full access to the single market, the rules on the freedom of movement are likely to stay the same. If the UK leaves the single market, it would be free to decide on its own immigration policy. Meanwhile, campaigners for Britain to remain in the EU warned that leaving it would damage the NHS.

The baby was killed by a police bullet while being taken to a babysitter, his mother said. The government denied it. More than 200 people have reportedly died in two months of demonstrations. The protests were triggered by government cuts to pensions and social security announced in April. Talks between President Daniel Ortega's government and the opposition to resolve the crisis collapsed earlier this week. Many students have set up protests camps in Managua, including at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua (UNAN), where hundreds live in tents and use homemade mortars in clashes. Two people were killed in the campus area on Saturday, according to activists. The combined forces - made up of police, anti-riot squads, paramilitary groups and pro-government vigilantes - also raided six neighbourhoods in eastern Managua, where the other deaths allegedly occurred. The government blamed local criminals for the death of the 18-month-old baby. But his mother rejected their story. \"He was killed by a police gunshot. I saw them. They were police. Nobody told me,\" Karina Navarrete told a news channel. Nicaraguan bishops have urged the Ortega government and the opposition Civic Alliance to return to the negotiating table on Monday to discuss bringing forward elections scheduled for 2021, in a bid to resolve the crisis. The barricades were set up weeks ago in cities across Nicaragua by opposition activists, who are demanding that Mr Ortega step down. The legislation for the government cuts, which has since been revoked, prompted nationwide demonstrations. Many people died in the marches - most of them university students - after a government crackdown.

Scientists reporting in Nature describe an astronomical study of extraordinary resolution to tackle the mystery. They found dust grains of nearly a millionth of a metre across, big enough to be pushed out by dying stars' light. The team of astronomers from Australian and European universities took a look at three so-called red giant stars - stars that were once like our Sun is now, but that have exhausted their supply of hydrogen and grown to gargantuan proportions. In a process that is an extreme case of the kind of solar wind that our own Sun experiences, such stars blow much of their mass away in the form of gas and grains of mineral material on their way to becoming white dwarfs. Lead author of the study Barnaby Norris, of the University of Sydney, told BBC News that the stars were \"the galaxy's great recyclers\" - the material that they spit out \"goes on to make the next generation of stars and planets\". Polarising discussion What has confused astronomers until now is just how that material is expelled; computer models of the process suggest that particles coming from the stars should be so small that they would simply absorb the light around them and undergo significant heating. To get a look at the dust surrounding the three red giants, Mr Norris and his colleagues used the Very Large Telescope in Chile, applying a technique called polarimetric interferometry. The light from the three stars, like that from our Sun, is unpolarised - the light waves undulate in random directions. But light that strikes the dust surrounding them is preferentially bounced toward us, undulating along a particular direction - just as sunlight reflected off a body of water is polarised along a direction parallel to the water's surface. The team refined a method of blocking some of the VLT's light and combining images of the stars in different p\n\nSummary:","152":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The laboratory off Audby Lane in Wetherby has dealt with evidence in cases as diverse as the assassination of the Swedish prime minister Olof Palme in 1986 and the disappearance of Peter Falconio in Australia in July 2001. 'Huge Losses' Evidence from the Yorkshire Ripper murders, the disappearance of Dewsbury youngster Shannon Matthews and the death of Lesley Molseed was dealt with at the Wetherby laboratory. But the Home Office has closed down the service nationally, delegating the work to private providers and police forces. In a statement the Home Office said: \"The reality is that the Forensic Science Service (FSS) was making huge losses. \"The managed wind-down of the FSS has ensured that the police and the criminal justice system continue to have the forensics capability to protect the public and bring criminals to justice. \"Significant progress has been made over the past year and the majority of the FSS's work has already been transferred to alternative forensic service providers, all of whom are accredited to required standards. \"The transition remains on schedule to be completed successfully by the end of this month. \"We are determined to ensure the continued provision of high quality, effective forensic services to the criminal justice system.\" 'Deeply disappointing' Prospect union negotiator, Steve Thomas, said questions remained over the logistics of how the area covered by several police forces across the north east of England would be served.

Rubbish on UK coasts rose by 6.4% from 2013 to 2014, it said in a report. Beaches in Wales had the highest litter levels, followed by those in England, while rubbish on coastlines in Scotland and Northern Ireland fell, it said. Wipes do not easily disintegrate and sewerage systems are not able to process them. They can block sewers, and when they are washed into the sea they can end up on beaches. The report - published as part of the MCS's annual Great British Beach Clean - was based on litter found by more than 5,000 volunteers on 301 UK beaches, from 19 to 22 September last year. Sewer blockages Volunteers collected 2,501 bags of rubbish from coastlines, including 273,747 items of litter. They collected 2,457 pieces of rubbish per kilometre - up from 2,309 bits per kilometre in 2013. Discarded items found included a colostomy bag, a plastic hand, a piping gun nozzle, a bra strap and - on one beach alone - nine pairs of shoes. The survey found: An average of 35 wet wipes were found for every kilometre of beach cleaned in 2014, up from 23 per kilometre the previous year.

But despite their silence, officers pieced together a harrowing picture of disturbing abuse, which was presented to the jury at the Old Bailey. Young girls were groomed, raped, abused and sold for sex by the gang of Oxford men, who have now been convicted of a catalogue of sex offences. Det Insp Simon Morton, of Thames Valley Police, said: \"They start out at 11 or 12 as ordinary girls, in our case, and by the time they're finished they're hollow. \"They are shells of what they should be and the little girl in there is gone. \"It's sexual atrocities, it's torture. \"You can't report it, you can't put it on TV, you can't write it down. We have had members of the press in tears in court. \"It's been horrendous.\" So who were the men who subjected these girls to such violent abuse - and who were the ringleaders? Mohammed and Bassam Karrar: Brothers who ran prostitution ring Mohammed Karrar was the most prolific offender in the case. The 38-year-old's family is thought to originate from Eritrea, in East Africa, but he grew up in his parents' house on the Cowley Road. He organised sex parties where he prostituted and raped girls in partnership with his younger brother Bassam, 33, a married father who worked as a security guard and also lived in Oxford. Mohammed was also married, having met and married his wife in Morocco and brought her to the UK approximately a decade ago. With no job, he would spend his days with her at his parents house in Cowley and nights with his mistress in Marston - when he was not carrying out horrific acts of abuse. In 2005, he had two children by the two different women, born less than two weeks apart. By the time he was arrested, he was a father of four. The brothers separately and together subjected victims three and four to a string of violent and sadistic rapes, often leaving them injured.

When Argentina's last military government was in power from 1976 to 1983, it executed people by throwing them out of planes into the ocean, in a practice known as \"death flights\".

Ugandan despot Idi Amin reportedly fed the bodies of dead prisoners to crocodiles.

Marvelling at the specimens being uncovered in southern England at the time, a young Owen recognised that the remains shared a number of distinctive features. They were \"terrible lizards\", he said. A diverse family of awesome animals that deserved their own distinct taxonomic group - which he named Dinosauria. The palaeontologist, who rose from a poor background in Lancashire to become something close to what we might consider a celebrity scientist today, went on to establish London's Natural History Museum in 1881. There, the latest fascinating dinosaur fossils became famous around the globe, and the terracotta-walled institution remains at the forefront of research today. It was a grand achievement for a man once labelled \"impudent\" by teachers at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, which he attended from 1809 to 1819. Current head teacher Dr Chris Pyle said: \"There isn't a huge amount in the school archives about his time here. \"But what we do have is this quote, which it is claimed was from one of his schoolmasters, referring to him as 'impudent'. \"It seems he was extremely stubborn, knew exactly what he wanted, was incredibly clever, but not in any way a conformist.\" Dr Pyle's description is not in any way at odds with how Owen would come to be known by his scientific contemporaries. He developed a reputation for controversy, was accused of stealing other scientists' specimens and undermining people by writing anonymous reviews of their work, while supporting them in public. Owen's contemporary and rival Gideon Mantell described him as \"overpaid, over-praised and cursed with a jealous monopolising spirit\". He was also said to have clashed with another great Victorian scientist - Charles Darwin.

The government has announced it will review its benefits system for the terminally ill following a damning parliamentary report. Emma welcomed the news and told the BBC: \"Financial worries should not be added to a families' difficulties at such a distressing time.\" Call for sensitivity Currently, when a person's death is expected within six months they qualify for fast-tracked access to benefits. But this six-month rule - which was introduced into law 30 years ago - was dubbed \"outdated, arbitrary and not based on clinical reality\" by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Terminal Illness. Emma, who is from Somerset, said: \"The higher rate attendance allowance took a few weeks to be assessed. All the while my father was deteriorating. The extra allowance helped my mother pay for additional support at home. \"My father was cared for in his own home, rather than in hospital, which saved the NHS thousands of pounds. The attendance allowance helped support our family to do this. \"My dad didn't know how long he had. The rest of the family did, but if someone is diagnosed with a terminal illness you don't want to necessarily put a timescale on this and suggest the clock is ticking.\" She called for the system to become more sensitive to the circumstances of the individuals with whom it was dealing. Repay money Steve Lenehan, from Maidenhead, agrees. His wife Claire died in 2007 at the age of 44 from pneumonia and heart failure. She had been diagnosed with stage four breast cancer four years earlier, shortly after their third child was born. Her benefits application was rejected at the time, but was granted when she reapplied in 2007, following a conversation with a Macmillan palliative care nurse. Steve said it was only then that they realised the doctor expected Claire to die within the next six months. She survived a few more weeks. \"My wife received the ter\n\nSummary:","164":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Ribble Valley MP Nigel Evans said: \"Decisions would be taken in Paris and Berlin; that's not in the interests of workers in Samlesbury and Warton.\" BAE said the business remained \"strong and financially robust\". Chief executive Ian King said he was disappointed the two companies were unable to reach agreement with government stakeholders. The UK wanted its French and German counterparts to agree to limit their influence in the merged firm in order to maintain BAE's strong working relations with the US Pentagon, but did not receive those assurances. Long-term worries Preston Labour MP Mark Hendrick said: \"I'm pleased it's fallen through on that basis - what we didn't want was the French and German governments dictating in future where investment should go. \"That's not the best outcome for British jobs and British interests.\" Experts have expressed concern that the market in defence aircraft is shrinking and the merger could have secured jobs at BAE. A Unite union spokesman said: \"I'm not surprised, but I'm not worried about jobs in the short term. \"I'm more worried about the longer term effect of cuts in defence spending, and we don't know what the longer term implications are. \"As it stands at the moment, we stand alone and nothing has changed.\" Earlier this year workers in Lancashire voted to lose a day's pay each month to stave off redundancies.

Passengers may still be charged a higher \"surge price\" at the time of their scheduled ride if there is high demand for Uber vehicles on the day. The feature will be enabled for business users in London first, with other Londoners getting access over the next two weeks. Surge pricing increases the cost of fares when there is high demand for Uber vehicles. Cars booked in advance will be subject to surge pricing - but passengers will have the option to cancel a booking if it is too expensive. Analysis by Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor Uber's latest move should help it take a bigger bite out of the business travel market. Companies will be able to use Uber, knowing executives won't have to wait for a post-meeting pick-up or early morning trip to the airport. But unlike at many minicab companies, the passenger and motorist are not paired in advance. Uber will need to work out when to send a car towards each pre-booked pick-up, taking into account not only traffic but the likelihood that the driver will actually accept the request. London is a big city, giving Uber a big pool of drivers to call on - it has 30,000 \"partners\" in the city - but it must deliver a reliable service if it is to woo passengers away from the likes of Addison Lee. A bigger issue could be that Uber's drivers won't necessarily wait if a customer is running late. Other minicab companies will - for an added fee. Uber says if there's a last minute delay, it will be up to the passenger to try to convince the driver to stay. But the fact surge pricing could still kick in may deter some riders, especially when it comes to scheduling a rush-hour trip. Scheduled rides were first introduced in Seattle on 9 June and now operate in several US cities. Uber is also testing a travelcard-style option in cities such as San Francisco and Miami, which lets riders buy access to cheaper fares. For example, riders in San Francisco can pay $20 \n\nSummary:","166":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The White House had announced the visit earlier in September. The US president was expected to visit his golf course in Doonbeg, County Clare, and Dublin on the weekend of 10-11 November. Mr Trump is due to travel to Paris on 11 November for commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One. The office for Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Leo Varadkar confirmed the November visit was cancelled and said the \"US side has cited scheduling reasons\". Politicians and activists in Ireland had indicated they would hold protests during Mr Trump's visit. Brendan Howlin, the leader of the Labour Party in the Republic of Ireland, said that Mr Trump was \"no friend of democracy or human rights\".

She said: \"We are hearing people say that they have had a new cough but didn't get a test because they didn't think it was a 'Covid' cough. \"Any new continuous cough should be a prompt to get a test, along with a high temperature or loss\/change in taste or smell.\" She said she hoped that people had stayed at home for New Year which should have an impact on the infection rate. \"We are still fighting back a wave of infections,\" she added. \"The simplest guidance at the moment is to stay at home with your own household as far as possible and avoid meeting others as much as you can.

The Nursing and Midwifery Council's (NMC) fitness to practice committee has given Mr Bolivar a 12-month caution. The ruling will allow him to remain in his job. Gross failings Mr Bolivar was reported to the NMC by Avon assistant coroner Dr Peter Harrowing following an inquest in 2017. It heard Mr Jones's mother Sue found him inattentive with breathing difficulties and had to perform CPR in a desperate bid to save him. Her son, from Corsham, Wiltshire, had learning difficulties and epilepsy. He had fallen ill following surgery for a benign tumour in his kidney. About a week later, Mrs Jones could not wake him up during a visit and, despite efforts by her and staff to revive him, he died from a cardiac arrest. At the inquest, Dr Harrowing said Mr Bolivar had failed to act with the \"necessary honesty and integrity as required of a registered nurse\" and said gross failings by the hospital, run by North Bristol NHS Trust, contributed to the death. The NMC panel ruled his fitness to practice is impaired because of misconduct but after hearing he had an otherwise blemish-free professional record during a 16-year nursing career, the panel issued him with a caution order. Mr Bolivar was described by colleagues at the hearing as \"caring\", \"competent\", \"professional\" and \"knowledgeable\". The caution order means that for the next year any prospective employer will be on notice that Mr Bolivar's fitness to practise has been found to be impaired.

They included his mother and father, his wife Reem, and their 17-year-old son Tawfik and 12-year-old-daughter Tala. \"This is a really big loss not just for us personally because we knew Ayman - this is also a loss for his patients and students,\" Dr Ghaith al-Zaanin, a close friend and former colleague who lives in Canada, told the BBC. As well as being in charge of internal medicine at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, Dr Abu al-Ouf oversaw its response to the coronavirus pandemic. He supervised the treatment of an entire ward of people with severe Covid-19 in a place where there are few specialists in respiratory illnesses. He also trained students from two local medical schools. \"To get someone as qualified as Ayman, you need at least 10 to 15 years of training,\" said Dr Zaanin, who named his own daughter Tala after his friend's. \"He dedicated his life to helping other people and treating patients, as well as to teaching our new generation of physicians.

The top-end version, with a synthetic fibre back and more RAM and storage - is 29,999 rupees ($430; \u00a3332).

Mr Hammond and the Treasury have long since given up on any idea that the UK can remain a member of the European Union. But, at heart, the most powerful department in government - and many forget that is still true despite the \"spreadsheet Phil\" dismissal of his critics - believes that the closest possible relationship with the European Union is the only way to reduce the potential of lasting economic damage to Britain post-Brexit. Whilst others such as Mr Johnson and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, have dominated the headlines, the Treasury has played it differently. Submarine would be a good descriptor. Under the surface, the department has focused its most senior people on persuading departments across government of two things. First, that the economic and trading links between Britain and the rest of the EU are so deep and intractable that a sharp and irrevocable split would carry perilous risk. From that argument came agreement to a \"transition period\" following the UK's official departure from the EU next March. Second, that open economies such as Britain depend on goods being traded freely across borders and that the way to achieve this with the UK's biggest customer, the EU, was via some form of customs deal. From that argument came the \"facilitated customs arrangement\" the Cabinet is discussing at Chequers today. A system that ties the UK so closely to EU regulations and processes that free-trade deals with other counties, such as America, become difficult to the point of impossible. In its arguments for the softest of soft Brexits, the Treasury has had some allies. The first is not a person, but a thing - the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Only via close alignment with the EU can there be any hope that the border can be kept free of customs ch\n\nSummary:","174":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He said that separating Victoria's Secret into a private company would \"restore\" the business's growth. The lingerie company accounted for nearly half of the company's $13.2bn revenue in 2019. But it has seen sales decline over the last year. L Brands valued the firm at $1.1bn and will retain a 45% stake. After selling several businesses, L Brands said it will concentrate on the beauty chain it owns, Bath & Body Works. Mr Wexner has been appointed chairman emeritus and will remain a member of the board. In 2019, he came under fire for his long friendship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Mr Wexner employed Epstein as a close adviser, but cut ties in 2007. He said he was \"embarrassed\" by his friendship with the US financier.

Following a seven-hour meeting of top officials, she agreed to stay on temporarily, with the party working to elect a new leader within six months. Congress ruled the country for decades, but has recently been routed in polls. This has led to sharp criticism of its leadership, which has long favoured the Gandhi family. The party was removed from power by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014, managing to win just 44 seats in the 543-member house. That was the beginning of a massive decline which also saw it lose control of a number of states where it held power. The 2019 election did not see a revival of its fortunes. In fact, many political observers say, it cemented just how unpopular the Congress - known as India's grand old party - had become with voters. It is now in power in just six Indian states - in four of those, it governs as a member of a coalition. Analysts and political commentators have attributed much of the blame to lacklustre leadership and the inability of the party to look beyond the Gandhi family. One member or another has been at the helm since India won independence from the UK in 1947. After Monday's marathon meeting in Delhi, Ms Gandhi said: \"Congress is one big family and I don't hold anything against anyone. But all, especially senior leaders should raise concerns at the party forum only.\" NDTV quoted her as saying: \"I am hurt but they are my colleagues, bygones are bygones, let us work together.\" She was referring to a letter written by 23 senior leaders, which stirred up controversy as it was the first time that so many party members had acknowledged the need for decisive change. Political observers say that it has exposed a long-running battle between older and younger members of the party. The letter was reportedly written last week but became public on Sunday, when it was published in the Indi\n\nSummary:","181":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

MPs are to vote on legalising same sex weddings, on Tuesday, but a number of Tory MPs are likely to oppose the bill. Conservative activists have signed letters voicing both opposition to, and support for, the move. The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill would enable same-sex couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies, where a religious institution had formally consented, in England and Wales. It would also allow couples who had previously entered into civil partnerships to convert their relationship into a marriage. 'No good reason' The plans have been strongly backed by Prime Minister David Cameron, but he is facing significant opposition from within his own party. Reports suggest upwards of 120 Tory MPs could vote against the plans, including some cabinet ministers. MPs will have a free vote on the issue, meaning they will not be issued orders by party whips, but the measure is expected to get through, with most on the Labour and Lib Dem benches supporting it. Maria Miller, who is leading the bill through Parliament, defended the proposals, saying marriage as an institution had always evolved and would continue to do so. \"The proposals for change are straightforward - if a couple love each other, then the state should not stop them getting married unless there is good reason - and being gay is not reason enough,\" she said. \"This bill is about choice. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who don't agree.\" On Sunday, more than 20 current and former constituency chairmen delivered a letter to 10 Downing Street urging the prime minister to delay any parliamentary decision on gay marriage until after the next election. It warned of \"significant damage to the Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2015 election\" if the plans enter law.

She lost her sight due to a degenerative illness. \"I often count the steps to get to a place, [so] if you change something on the way, I get lost. \"I haven't gone shopping yet.

Twins Lorenzo and Francesco, 13, Rome Lorenzo likes to play drums and Francesco loves to sing, but during quarantine the courses they were enrolled on stopped. They are twins, both blind, and often enjoy playing and singing on the porch until sunset. The teaching activity at their middle school also stopped and the support teacher couldn't assist them at home. Instead, their mother and grandmother support them, with considerable effort. They are unable to lead an independent life, and social distancing risks isolating them. \"They should be the first in a society, not the last,\" says Grandma Anna.

However, she hasn't gone for a walk in months. \"I have to say that the idea of leaving the house gives me some anxiety,\" she says. \"I live in Lucio Sestio and I often use the subway, but now I know that the exits and the entrances have changed to facilitate the distancing of people, [so] I'm afraid of feeling lost. \"There is also no tactile path that can help me maintain orientation\".

This could have involved giving evidence in court. The original case related to an alleged sexual assault at Duncroft approved school in Middlesex in the late 1970s. A wider police inquiry is under way. The Met Police announced last week that it had identified 200 potential victims of the BBC presenter and other people who are still living. BBC programme Newsnight contacted the CPS in November last year about the original case, to be told prosecution had been dropped due to lack of evidence. The second case was an alleged indecent assault on a girl under the age of 16 at Stoke Mandeville hospital in or around 1973. The third was an alleged incitement of a girl under 16 to engage in a sexual act at Duncroft in the late 1970s. The fourth was an alleged indecent assault on an adult in Sussex in 1970. All four were part of a single file submitted by Surrey Police to the CPS in 2009. A CPS spokeswoman said: \"The evidence showed that none of the alleged victims would support a prosecution. \"In these circumstances the CPS concluded that it was not possible to bring a prosecution in this matter. \"Prosecutors have to satisfy themselves that there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in order to be able to take a case to court and it was concluded that no further action could be taken in this case.\" A six-week BBC Newsnight investigation into claims that Savile abused youngsters - which also took in whether there were institutional failings by police or the Crown Prosecution Service - was dropped in December 2011.

At its height, some 1,300 men worked there, mining about 400 tonnes of coal a day. The 7ft 6in statue (2.3m), depicting a 1960s miner, was unveiled on Saturday to commemorate the area's mining roots. It stands in the Miners' Memorial Garden in the centre of the village. Since the closure of colliery, the area has undergone a huge transformation that has seen much of it turned into the Ifton Meadow nature reserve. Former miner Terry Ellis, one of those behind the campaign for a statue, said the mine's closure \"shocked\" the village at the time. \"You have what you believe is a secure, steady job with an assured income for the future, then someone somewhere comes along and makes a decision that your source of income will be closed,\" he said.\n\nSummary:","186":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The work by renowned photographer Spencer Tunick involved 3,200 participants from 20 countries posing in front of various landmarks. Commissioned by the Ferens Art Gallery, the images will be exhibited during 2017's UK City of Culture events. Thousands of volunteers gathered just before dawn to be daubed with four shades of blue body paint which represented water. They posed at a number of locations across the city including Queen's Gardens, the Guildhall and the Scale Lane swing bridge, for a photo shoot that lasted about four hours. One of the participants included 80-year-old Stephane Janssen, from Brussels, who has posed for Tunick on 20 previous occasions. \"It's just aesthetically fantastic. It's beautiful, we are little strokes of paint. Everybody is equal - no race nor sex difference - I mean, everybody is the same, naked...and that's what I love,\" he said. Sarah Hossack, from Hull, said it was \"absolutely fantastic\" to be part of the artwork. \"I've been naked since four o'clock this morning. But it was so much fun, so inclusive and just brilliant, like a festival atmosphere. We've all got closer together as people over the last few hours. \"It's just fantastic and just what the city needs.\" The local authority said the installation had attracted \"the largest number of participants\" in any of Tunick's previous UK artworks, beating Gateshead in 2005 and Salford in 2010. Tunick said: \"The Sea of Hull installation was one of the most fantastic projects I've ever done, and it was inspiring to be able to intertwine the city's maritime heritage against an urban backdrop throughout the whole piece.\" Kirsten Simister, curator of art at Ferens Art Gallery, said she was \"overwhelmed\" by the number of people who took part in the project.

Scotland is the only UK country with no national strategy for school-based counselling services. The Scottish government said some health boards had a \"long way to go\" on mental health provision. Research suggests that half of mental health problems start before the age of 15. The Scottish Youth Parliament, Penumbra, Place2Be and Children in Scotland are also supporting the call for support to be improved in all schools and in the community. Local government body Cosla said budget cuts had led to a shortage of mental health workers and educational psychologists. Psychologist shortage A spokesman said: \"Scotland's councils take the health and well-being of the children in our schools very seriously indeed. \"Councils employ educational psychologists and these officers are shared across the local authority area - focusing primarily on the children who need them, wherever they are based. \"We have a shortage of educational psychologists in Scotland at the present time and we are working jointly with the Scottish government to consider solutions to the issue. \"The mental health of our young people is a priority for Cosla and we know that it takes a range of professional officers to support our young people.\" A fifth of children referred to NHS Scotland's mental health counselling service, Camhs, are not seen within an 18-week target.

For those that have nervously opened the envelope to find good news, they have the added satisfaction of knowing they succeeded in what the university says was the most competitive year yet. More than 17,200 people were chasing 3,200 places. The application process has a daunting reputation and, for state school pupils, it can seem especially difficult. While only 7% of pupils in England and Wales are from the independent sector, they make up around 46% of Oxford's undergraduates. The university says these stats don't tell the whole story, because a third of students with all A grades in their A-levels - the pool of talent from which Oxford students are drawn - are privately educated. Getting in is hard, but perhaps not as hard as people think, says Mike Nicholson, the university's head of undergraduate admissions, with on average five applications for every place. \"We're looking for students who are intelligent - very interested in their subject and who can demonstrate their interest,\" he says. So what are the ingredients of a successful application? 1.

Eastbourne, Bexley, Luton and Peterborough will get more flexibility to borrow money from the government. It comes as some local authorities are warning of financial ruin amidst pressure from Covid-19. Councils' core spending power is due to rise by up to \u00a32.3bn next year, but some councils are still warning of shortfalls amid hits to income. BBC analysis in 2020 revealed the scale of the problems facing them, with nearly 150 forecasting a combined budget shortfall of at least \u00a33.2bn. Some of the largest UK councils have been warning that they may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support. The government had previously provided almost \u00a35bn in emergency support since the start of the pandemic to help councils deal with spiralling costs. Support 'never provided lightly' The four councils have been granted \"capitalisation directions\" allowing them to borrow money from the government to cover day-to-day costs. Normally, councils can only borrow money for investments or capital projects such as building work. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Jenrick said there was \"quite a broad range\" of reasons why additional taxpayer support was required. He said with some this was due to \"poor management,\" and others due to \"the exceptional events of the past year\". He added that the funding had been granted on an \"exceptional basis\" and the councils would be subject to \"rigorous reviews\" of their finances. \"Taxpayer support of this kind is never provided lightly, and in return for the increased flexibility afforded to councils next year, we expect sound financial management with residents shielded from unaffordable increases.\" Mr Jenrick also announced a \u00a350,000 fund for the Isle of Wight fund to review the challenges face by the council, residents and businesses on the island in terms of access to vit\n\nSummary:","192":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Some of the items the supplier had to import to make the wine were now scarce, said the spokesman. Monsignor Lucker added that they had enough supplies for just two more months, and that he did not know if the Church could afford wines from abroad. But the problem was not limited to wine, he said. \"The makers of consecrated bread have told us that they'll have to raise prices because they can't find enough flour. \"Wheat is not grown here - it all comes from abroad,\" he said. \"A packet of consecrated bread used to cost 50 bolivar ($8, \u00a35), but it's now 100.\" Toilet paper shortages Oil-rich Venezuela relies on imports, but currency controls have restricted its ability to pay for foreign goods, a reason for the shortages.

The comments followed a report by a UN trade agency on the impact of the US-China trade war. It said Asian countries are likely to suffer most from protectionism. The US and China are locked in a damaging trade dispute that has seen both sides levy tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. In December, both countries agreed to hold off on new tariffs for 90 days to allow for talks. The US and China have a deadline of 1 March to strike a deal, or the US has said it will increase tariff rates on $200bn (\u00a3152bn) worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) has warned that there will be huge costs if the trade war escalates. \"The implications are going to be massive,\" Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Unctad's head of international trade, said at a news conference. \"The implications for the entire international trading system will be significantly negative.\" Smaller and poorer countries would struggle to cope with the external shocks, she said. The higher cost of US-China trade would prompt companies to shift away from current east Asian supply chains. Unctad's report estimates that east Asian producers will be hit the hardest, with a projected $160bn contraction in the region's exports. But it warns the effects could be felt everywhere. \"There'll be currency wars and devaluation, stagflation leading to job losses and higher unemployment and more importantly, the possibility of a contagion effect, or what we call a reactionary effect, leading to a cascade of other trade distortionary measures,\" Ms Coke-Hamilton said.

Primaries one to three returned full time on 22 February, along with older pupils in S4 to S6 who had to complete work for qualifications. Primaries four to seven make a full-time return from Monday.

Biologists say it can have a devastating impact on native species and could even lead to extinctions. The nets will be deployed at other \"high priority sites\" across Wales. The Dikerogammarus villosus, originally from the region around the Black and Caspian seas, has spread across western Europe over the past 10 years via waterways such as the Danube and Rhine Canal. The only other confirmed population in the UK is at the Grafham Water reservoir in Cambridgeshire. It is not known how it got there or to the two sites in south Wales. Measuring up to 30mm in length, it thrives on hard surfaces like boulders, rocks and gravel just below the water surface so such areas are being treated as priority for sampling in Wales. It has earned its nickname because it sometimes kills its prey and leaves it uneaten. The Welsh Assembly Government and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have established a national task group to tackle the shrimp. It includes Environment Agency Wales and the Countryside Council for Wales. Native invertebrates Andrew Johnson of the Environment Agency said: \"We know from research done in other parts of the world that the spread of the this fish can have a devastating effect on the ecology. \"We do not want to replicate this impact which is why the work we are doing with these traps is so important.\" He said the shrimp could damage fisheries in Wales and if it were to spread lead to the demise of other native invertebrates such as mayflies.

The HS2 network is due to be built in stages, with the final leg to Leeds completed by 2040. But critics say its \u00a3106bn price tag cannot be justified. In December, the National Infrastructure Commission said that the government should focus on improving rail links between cities in the North and Midlands over new projects such as HS2. As a result, transport groups in the North and Midlands had feared the eastern leg of the project could be scrapped. However, speaking at an online event run by the Policy Exchange think tank this week Mr Shapps said HS2 would be built in full and might be delivered earlier than previously planned. \"We are going to complete HS2 and include HS2 on the eastern leg to Leeds,\" he said. \"The only question that we have is how to better integrate that with plans which have developed a very long way since HS2 was first dreamt up all those decades ago. That particularly pertains to the northern powerhouse rail.\" Mr Shapps suggested the eastern leg to Leeds originally scheduled for completion between 2035 and 2040 could be brought forward \"quite dramatically\" by building it \"in a smarter way\". He said the government would provide further information on that \"soon\". Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, a lobby group, said the government was doing the right thing. \"It's critical to ensuring levelling up is a reality not just rhetoric,\" said Mr Murison, referring to election promises to boost the economy in the north of England. Maria Machancoses, chief executive of Midlands Connect, a government-funded regional transport body, said: \"While these verbal commitments are encouraging, we need definitive action, namely the publication of the government's Integrated Rail Plan, to give businesses and investors the confidence they need to make decisions. \"The quicker we know government's intentions, the faster we can ac\n\nSummary:","201":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But its future direction is of geopolitical importance. Why does Ukraine matter to US? For much of its 28-year independent history it has been unclear whether Ukraine would end up aligned with Russia or the West. In 2014, that uncertainty appeared to come to an end. After a bloody street revolution, Ukraine's new leaders asserted that the country's future lay with closer association with Europe and the West. Russia was now seen as the enemy and it responded by seizing Crimea and supporting an armed uprising in eastern Ukraine that has so far cost more than 13,000 lives. Under the US Obama administration, Ukrainians' right to decide their own future, and to resist Russian aggression, was defended as an important ideological principle. That changed when President Trump took office, and Ukraine's government has not been able to rely on America's active support in the same way since. How much military aid does the US give? The US has a longstanding relationship with the Ukrainian military and has committed about $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn; \u20ac1.4bn) in aid since 2014. Much of that has been spent training soldiers and in efforts to modernise the dated way the Ukrainian army is organised and operates. The latest tranche of assistance, which was held up and then released by the Trump administration, is worth $391m and includes a range of weapons and technical assistance. How important is US military aid and support to Ukraine? It is important on both a military and symbolic level. Where once the Ukrainian military knew that the US had their backs, this can no longer be taken for granted. The wavering over assistance, and President Trump's frequent derogatory words about Ukraine, will almost certainly have strengthened Moscow's hand in peace negotiations. How is Ukraine linked to Trump impeachment inquiry?

She said: \"My health isn't as good as it was, they're just brushing me off.\" Pucklechurch Parish Council said there had been concerns about the garden's ongoing maintenance over several years. 'Where Rebekka played' Rebekka was killed near her South Gloucestershire home when a car mounted the pavement and hit her. The Home Office donated the \"small corner plot\" of land for Rebekka's Garden in 2001. It is owned by the parish council for insurance purposes. \"It's on the corner opposite my house where Rebekka used to play,\" said Ms Hudd. \"It's Rebekka's memory and Rebekka's Garden and is really important to me.\" The 65-year-old said both her parents and children had helped maintain the garden \"as and when it needed it\" over the years. She said it was \"very upsetting\" when she received a letter from the parish council saying it would be \"consulting with the community to develop a scheme to enhance and improve the garden\". 'Clear off now' She said the council told her they appreciated her \"efforts to maintain the area\" over the years but the garden was \"now in need of a programme of maintenance improvements\". They thanked her for her efforts but as owners of the land they \"no longer\" required her assistance in maintaining the site. \"My health isn't as good as it was and I can't go over there and spend hours and hours,\" she said. \"But after 20 years, they're just brushing me off - telling me clear off now.\" The parish council said it had been in regular contact with Ms Hudd over concerns about the ongoing maintenance of the garden over several years.

The council says it will peg the cost of an annual permit at \u00a3370, saying it offers regular users a 60% discount on the pay-and-display prices. The extra cash raised will also help fund free parking for blue badge users. The charge for parking a car for more than four hours is to rise from \u00a33.20 to \u00a34 - a 25% increase - while lorry drivers face a rise of more than 50% from \u00a35.30 to \u00a38. Vehicles that take up two spaces will be expected to pay double the price, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Short-stay car parks in Powys will still charge \u00a31 for up to an hour, but the charge for up to two hours will rise from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32.

Here's a look at 13 of the most eye-catching outfits. 1. Billie Eilish is going to find it difficult to text with these nails The singer wore a gorgeous white Chanel jacket on the red carpet, complete with several Chanel accessories. Her hair was fixed with the \"CC\" logo hairclip and tied in a Chanel headband, while her lacy fingerless gloves were labelled with \"Cha\" and \"Nel\". Her extra-long black nails completed the look, which was easily one of the highlights of this year's red carpet. Eilish went on to perform at the ceremony. The rumours that she would debut her new Bond theme sadly came to nothing, but she did perform a haunting rendition of Yesterday by The Beatles, to accompany the In Memoriam section. 2. Natalie Portman staged a quiet protest You might not have heard about this because hardly anybody has mentioned it in the past month, but no women were nominated for best director at the Oscars this year. So Natalie Portman decided to take matters into her own hands. The actress wore a black Dior gown embroidered with the surnames of the women who would have been eligible in the category, having directed major feature films in the past year. The names included: Lorene Scafaria (who directed Hustlers), Lulu Wang (The Farewell), Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood) and Melina Matsoukas (Queen & Slim). However, she was criticised by fellow actress Rose McGowan for not \"walking the walk\" on the issue. Portman's production company has not yet made a film with a female director other than Portman herself. 3.

Police wielding batons broke up a demonstration in front of the Catalan regional parliament. Hundreds of activists occupied high-speed rail tracks for several hours. Roads and a motorway were also blocked. Catalonia held the vote on 1 October 2017 and its separatist government declared independence on 27 October. But Spain's constitutional court deemed the referendum illegal and Madrid imposed direct rule. At the time, there were ugly scenes on the streets as Spanish police tried to prevent people from going to the polls. The anniversary protests were organised by the Committees for the Defence of the Republic (CDRs), which are demanding a clean break with the Spanish state. The CDRs briefly blocked the rail service between Barcelona and Figueres, as well as city streets in Lleida and Barcelona and the motorway between the coastal city and the Spanish capital, Madrid. CDR groups also demonstrated in cities around the world, including in London and Paris. 'Putting on the pressure' In June, Spain ended its temporary direct rule over the region, as a new nationalist-led government was sworn in there, headed up by Quim Torra. Speaking earlier at a ceremony at Sant Julia de Ramis, northern Catalonia, Mr Torra praised activists for \"putting on the pressure\". Mr Torra succeeded Carles Puigdemont, who fled into exile in Belgium after the failed independence bid. Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, who is Catalan, said it was up to Mr Torra and the Catalan regional government to maintain public order. \"We will continue to try to lower tensions... and demand that everyone assume their responsibilities,\" he told reporters in Madrid. An opinion poll in July suggested 46.7% of Catalans favoured independence and 44.9% opposed it.

In December, the government was housing 61,327 asylum seekers compared to about 47,000 a year earlier, according to the Home Office. It said it needs to find more accommodation in order to meet its legal obligations. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"All accommodation will be Covid-secure, safe, habitable, fit for purpose and correctly equipped in line with existing standards and contractual requirements. \"The safety and security of the local community, asylum seekers, staff and visitors are of paramount importance.\" Objections from the faith and community leaders, who come from Christian, Sikh, Muslim, Hindu and Baha'i organisations, include its proximity to the detention centre, the \"significant difficulties and trauma\" faced by many of the intended residents, the type of accommodation and Yarl's Woods' \"distance from urban centres\". Reverend Luke Larner, from Red Letter Christians UK in Bedford, said: \"We would like a better alternative that is beneficial for the wellbeing of these people.\" Yarl's Wood, which opened in 2001, can hold about 400 detainees.

The council said it was advising residents. Mr Cane, 66, said the home he has lived in for 15 years was once 82ft (25m) from the edge of the cliff.

But it was Birmingham's original Bull Ring Centre in 1964 that sparked a boom in US-style shopping centre complexes. However, experts have issued a warning for their future amid a decline in \"major anchor stores\" and rise in online shopping. When the Bull Ring opened its doors it was meant to be \"the ultimate shopping experience\", according to historian Carl Chinn. It was described as the biggest indoor shopping centre outside the US. Scores of other shopping centres followed its lead in bringing together many outlets in one place, and started appearing in towns and cities up and down the country. They continued to be a favoured destination for shoppers in the 1980s and 90s. But the rise of online retailers such as Amazon, and the economic downturn post-2008, has made life for shopping centre bosses much more challenging. Hundreds of premises lie empty across the country, and more centres are at-risk, according to analyst Nelson Blackley from the National Retail Research Knowledge Exchange Centre. It appears that these retail centres, which were once the hubs for shopping activity in towns and cities across the UK, will continue to face an uncertain future.\n\nSummary:","211":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It added that in many cases people were included for raising legitimate concerns over health and safety issues. The list was drawn up by The Consulting Association (TCA). The organisation was closed down in 2009 after being raided by the Information Commissioner's Office. Unions are seeking compensation, arguing that those on the blacklist were denied work. The MPs said some of the biggest names in construction as well as many smaller firms had been involved. In an interim report, the committee said: \"The organisation set up to create, maintain and operate the blacklist - The Consulting Association (TCA) - appears to have been largely established by Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, which also provided TCA's chairmen for eight of its 16 years of operation. \"Other major subscribers included Skanska and Balfour Beatty.\" Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, whose director Cullum McAlpine appeared before the committee, responded to the report by denying it had ever operated a blacklist. 'Morally indefensible' The MPs said that while the blacklist was not initially illegal, it was always \"morally indefensible\", and the companies involved continued to use it after it had become illegal. The MPs found companies set up a structure through TCA which allowed them to submit names and information on workers they deemed to be unsuitable to a central list and to check prospective employees against that list. \"The emphasis throughout was on secrecy, with telephone access to sensitive information restricted to only a few, with the lists of names submitted destroyed at the end of each working day and no acknowledgement that such a system existed,\" the MPs said.

But it urged the chancellor to \"resist the temptation to engage in any significant net giveaway\" as a result. It also said that spending cuts could be \"formidably hard to deliver\". The warning comes in the IFS' Green Budget which aims to assess the government's position ahead of the March Budget. Surprise news that the UK economy contracted at the end of last year prompted a debate about whether the government should change its plans to cut spending and raise taxes - which is known as fiscal tightening. The IFS report suggests the government should stay the course and continue with the \"fiscal repair job\" that it aims to complete by the next general election. \"While last week's growth figures were disappointing, this year's Green Budget highlights that any fiscal loosening aimed at helping the economy could be ineffective,\" it said. It said to do so would risk fuelling inflation. This could trigger higher interest rates, which in turn could stymie economic growth. A change also \"risks undermining investor confidence that the remainder of the fiscal consolidation plan, in which the chancellor has set such store, will be delivered\", the report added. Responding to the IFS report, a government source said the Green Budget was an endorsement of its policy. However Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"This report exposes the myth that George Osborne had no choice but to cut the deficit at this speed and scale. \"We have been clear that George Osborne has made a political choice to cut too far, too fast and that without a plan for jobs and growth you can't get the deficit down.\" 'Gloomy caveats' The BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, concluded that the IFS report was broadly supportive of the government's plans - but with \"gloomy caveats\". \"They [the IFS] think the downside risks are probably\n\nSummary:","216":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The findings from a staff survey have been revealed after a request under Freedom of Information Act (FOI). More than 1,000 officers and 700 staff responded to the survey, which examined opinions towards the public, the force and job satisfaction. Findings included: Mr Llwyd, MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and deputy chair of the justice select committee, said the survey backed claims by some people who say they had gone to the police with an issue but believed it was pointless. It was \"awful\" that some officers said some communities did not respect police, and it was a waste of time helping them, he added. \"I hope that these findings will be taken on board by senior managers to ensure training of police officers in north Wales reflects that everybody that comes to them, obviously in need, should be dealt with accordingly.\" \"I'm sure it will be addressed, but it does need need to be looked at urgently, because otherwise we've got a first and second tier citizen in north Wales, and that will never be right,\" he added.

It says letting universities recruit unlimited AAB+ grade students will set up an \"arms race\" for the privileged. Ministers say the reforms will ensure students get \"good value for money\". The White Paper for higher education, published in June, raised the tuition fee cap for English universities from just over \u00a33,000 to \u00a39,000 from autumn 2012. Ministers expected the \u00a39,000-a-year fee to be the exception, anticipating most to charge around \u00a37,500, but the majority of universities in England and Wales have outlined their plans to charge the top fee. In its assessment of the long-term impact of the White Paper, Hepi says plans to reduce student number allocations for universities charging more than \u00a36,000, but allow them to take unlimited numbers of top AAB+ students, could bring \"unwelcome\" consequences for the government, universities, and students. The logistics of how universities will be allowed to take more students with grades AAB or better is currently being worked out by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, but the policy will ensure universities will not be penalised for going over their student quota if those students are high-achievers. The report says: \"Most universities will be obliged if not immediately then within a year or two, to reduce their net fees to \u00a37,500. \"They will become unviable very quickly otherwise, losing 8% or more of their students every year.\" Under the new regime, students who have their permanent home in England will have to pay the full tuition fees. Scottish students studying in Scotland will pay no fees in 2012, Welsh students will be partly subsidised.

Mowi said a total of 48,834 salmon escaped, 30,616 died and a further 125,000 were harvested. Environmental campaigners have raised concerns about the escaped fish breeding with wild Scottish salmon.\n\nSummary:","220":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

She estimates that 4% of revenues could be lost after Brexit because Lloyd's would lose its licence - or passporting - rights to operate across the EU. The fallout from Brexit \"is a major issue for us to deal with\", she said. Lloyd's, one of Britain's oldest institutions, is the world's leading insurance and reinsurance market and houses around 90 syndicates. It focuses on specialist markets, such as marine, energy and political risk, and this year insured the taste buds of a Cadbury's chocolate taster. Continental Europe accounts for about 11% of gross premiums written by the London market. Ms Beale told the BBC that Lloyd's was now \"focusing our attention\" on maintaining its position in a post-Brexit landscape. It had not yet been decided whether to establish branches in individual EU countries or an EU-wide subsidiary, but the latter option would probably be cheaper, she said. But Ms Beale said Lloyd's had to respond. \"It's the lack of certainty for our clients. Business cannot hang around,\" she said. \"Boards are going to insist that they make plans [for life after Brexit]\" 'Difficult conditions' She did not disclose details of the size of any EU-based subsidiary or consequences for jobs, but said: \"Some people may end up doing their jobs in other parts of Europe rather than in London.\" Her comments came as Lloyd's reported half-year pre-tax profits of \u00a31.46bn, up from \u00a31.20bn for the six months last year. Despite the rise, premiums continue to be under pressure, said Lloyd's chairman John Nelson. He said: \"Whilst we are operating in difficult conditions, we have continued to make significant progress in growing our presence in the fast-growth markets across the globe. \"In 2016 we have applied for onshore reinsurance licences in India and Malaysia as well as opening a new office in Bogota, Colombia.

Conservation groups say they are particularly concerned about the plight of the prickly creatures in rural areas. Figures suggest the animals are disappearing more rapidly in the countryside, as hedgerows and field margins are lost to intensive farming. But there are signs that populations in urban areas may be recovering. David Wembridge, surveys officer for the conservation charity, People's Trust for Endangered Species (PTES), said two surveys of the number of hedgehogs in gardens and one of numbers killed on roads show an overall decline. But he said there is \"a glimmer of hope\" that measures to create habitat for hedgehogs in urban areas are paying off. \"Numbers haven't recovered yet but in urban areas at least there's an indication that numbers appear to have levelled in the last four years,\" he said. In rural areas, the number of hedgehogs killed on roads has fallen by between a third and a half across Great Britain, The State of Britain's Hedgehogs 2018 report found. Emily Wilson, Hedgehog Officer for the campaign group, Hedgehog Street, said the apparent decline in the rural population of hedgehogs was \"really concerning\" . The loss of hedges and copses to create larger fields has resulted in fewer nesting sites and less protection for hedgehogs, she said. \"This kind of barren one-crop landscape has removed the amount of area that hedgehogs can live in,\" said Ms Wilson. \"The large-scale pesticide use has reduced the amount of food for them to eat - there are fewer invertebrates.\" Rough estimates put the hedgehog population in England, Wales and Scotland at about one million, compared with 30 million in the 1950s.

An emotional opening Everyone knew what Christine Blasey Ford was going to say before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday morning. Knowing what she was going to say and hearing her speak it, in a quiet, sometimes faltering voice, are two very different things, however. For a taut 20 minutes, Dr Ford held the stage with searing emotion. She spoke of traumatic memories and decades of shame; of a civic duty to come forward; and recent months of hounding media and death threats. During questioning from Democratic senators, Dr Ford went on to provide more memorable lines. She said she was 100% certain that Brett - referring to Mr Kavanaugh repeatedly by his first name - was the teenager who assaulted her. She recounted how the enduring recollection she has from the incident, burned into her brain, was of Mr Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge, laughing as they stumbled down the stairs after the alleged attack. The images of her speaking - the first glimpse the public at large has had of her besides a few grainy photos - will linger well beyond Thursday's hearing or even Brett Kavanaugh's ultimate professional fate. Her name, like that of Anita Hill 27 years before her, will be a part of American history, held up by her advocates as a talisman for a troubled time. An inconsistent cross-examination Thanks in large part to a disjointed format that featured five-minute segments alternating between veteran sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, a surrogate questioner for the Republicans, and Democratic senators, there was little flow to proceedings after Dr Ford's powerful opening. It was as if viewers were flipping back and forth between a CourtTV criminal cross-examination and a public-access television congressional hearing.

Today, on the second day of this heroic year, I am now ready to reveal to you the proud news of the most honourable victory in the annals of military heroism that runs through many centuries of our history. Friends Although the leader of the LTTE had said only a few days ago that the capture of Kilinochchi was only a dream of Mahinda Rajapaksa, in truth it was not my dream alone. It was the constant dream of all Sri Lankans, whether Sinhala, Tamil or Muslim, who are opposed to separatism, racism, and terrorism, and have always, sought peace, freedom and democracy. Today our heroic troops have made that dream a reality. A short while ago, our brave and heroic troops have fully captured Kilinohchi that was considered the main bastion of the LTTE. Our have troops have completely taken over the fortress of the LTTE that has been described by our own leaders and accepted internationally as the most powerful terrorist organization in the world. Whatever the words or language used to describe it, this is truly an incomparable victory. What our heroic troops have achieved is not only the capture of the great fortress of the LTTE, but a major victory in the world\u2019s battle against terrorism. The entire world must today appreciate the outstanding success of the Sri Lankan troops. One must not belittle this victory as one that has been won by one community over another. It should not be interpreted as defeat of the North by the South. This is a victory for our entire nation and country.

The Eva bra, made by him and three friends who formed a company together, is only at the prototype stage. But they have raised enough money to start tests and, this week, won the top prize at the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards. Their company, Higia Technologies, beat young entrepreneurs from around the world to win $20,000 (\u00a315,500) to develop their idea. How would a cancer-detecting bra work? Cancerous tumours may turn skin a different temperature due to increased blood flow. The idea of the Eva bra is that biosensors would measure temperatures, log them in an app, and alert a user to any disturbing changes. Women using the bra would need to wear it for 60-90 minutes a week to get accurate measurements. In one interview last year, Julian said having the sensors inside a bra would mean the breasts were in the same position each time measurements were taken. Will a cancer-detecting bra actually work? This is in the really early stages. It hasn't been fully tested yet and there would need to be medical trials before cancer experts started recommending it as a way to find cancer. Anna Perman from Cancer Research UK told the BBC: \"We know that tumours often have an abnormal system of blood vessels, but we also know that increased blood flow isn't necessarily a reliable marker of cancer. \"At present, there is no evidence to show whether this bra is a reliable way to detect tumours, and it's certainly not a good idea for women to use technology that hasn't been tested in good-quality scientific trials. \"It's great to see young people like Julian getting into science and having ideas that could help with cancer diagnosis.

They conducted the first research into the genetic characteristics of the wild ponies, which take their name from the Carneddau Mountains. Hair samples were taken from different breeds, including Highland ponies. The aim was to establish to what extent the Carneddau ponies are related to other UK native breeds. Scientists at the university's Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (Ibers) particularly want to establish whether the ponies were relatively recently separated from the similar Welsh Section A pony. This is a registered breed that is geographically nearest and similar in appearance to the Carneddau pony. 'Vital role' Clare Winton, an Ibers post-graduate student who performed the study as part of her PhD thesis, said the Carneddau ponies are a genetically distinct population. \"Although the Carneddau ponies have shared ancestry with the Welsh Section A pony, they exhibit genetic signatures demonstrating that the population has been isolated for at least several hundred years,\" she said. The results of the findings come after a large number of ponies died during the recent heavy snowfall which hit the hill communities hard. Hair samples were collected from Carneddau ponies during their autumn round up. DNA was extracted from the hair and then tested. Dr Debbie Nash, lecturer in equine and animal science and one of the Ibers researchers, explained that the Carneddau ponies play a vital role within the mountain ecology of the Snowdonia National Park.

In them, a group of veteran engineers is toiling to help recreate the pioneering Edsac computer. Designed by Sir Maurice Wilkes, Edsac first ran in 1949 and was made to serve scientists at the University of Cambridge. It helped them push the boundaries of their disciplines by giving them a tool that could crunch numbers faster than they could ever manage. \"The problems they were tackling were not practical using hand-based calculation methods,\" said James Barr, one of the veterans reconstructing the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator. Edsac quickly proved its usefulness and helped two Cambridge scientists win Nobel prizes.

That, said Mr Barr, left the Edsac reconstruction project with a big problem. Namely, they did not have a clear idea of how the thing was wired up. The project to recreate Edsac was undertaken to help fill gaps in knowledge about the way that this early British computer was built and worked. Once complete it will become a living exhibit at The National Museum of Computing where it will be used to help teach schoolchildren about programming.

She left the plantation, in Dorchester County, Maryland, in September and travelled by night. Her exact route is unknown, but she probably walked along the Choptank river and journeyed through Delaware, guided by the North Star. Years later, she recalled the moment she entered Pennsylvania, where slavery was illegal: \"When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.\" In the years that followed, Tubman returned again and again to Maryland to rescue others, conducting them along the so-called \"underground railroad\", a network of safe houses used to spirit slaves from the South to the free states in the North. Later, she became a Union spy during the Civil War, a prominent supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and a famous veteran of the struggle for the abolition of slavery. But in September 1849, aged 27, Tubman was an unknown slave, uncertain about her future in the wake of her master's death. Fearful of being sold further south, she gathered her two younger brothers, Benjamin and Henry, and on the night of the 17th they escaped. With the help of their father, who had been granted his freedom, the three fugitives hid for three weeks. A notice published in a local newspaper offered a $100 reward for the return of each of them.

Plans to extend benefits to unmarried gay couples have been dropped. The move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The Pentagon had already extended certain privileges to same-sex couples after a ban on openly gay troops - known as Don't Ask, Don't Tell - was repealed in September 2011. But most benefits had been off-limits until the Supreme Court ruling. \"It is now the department's policy to treat all married military personnel equally,\" Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a memo on Wednesday to senior Pentagon officials. The Pentagon also stated it would grant leave for military personnel stationed in a US state that does not permit same-sex marriage to travel to a jurisdiction where they can marry legally. \"This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married,\" said Navy Lt Commander Nate Christensen, a Pentagon spokesman. The change will enable homosexual troops and their spouses to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery near Washington DC.

Last year, the Scottish government pledged to meet councils over setting a minimum level but it never happened. Education secretary John Swinney has now said he wants a voluntary agreement for councils to set a nationwide rate. Mr Swinney said there would be a range of views on the minimum rate but suggested it \"should probably be set about \u00a370\". That was the amount proposed by a Scottish government working group in 2009. Eight years later, just 10 of the 32 councils have met that recommendation. The average clothing grant for eligible parents is now \u00a363.80. Research by campaign group The Poverty Truth Commission suggested the actual cost of kitting out a child for school was \u00a3129.50, even when shopping at supermarkets and bargain stores. Mr Swinney told BBC Scotland the Scottish government had the power to set a minimum rate but he thought \"dialogue\" with the local councils was the best way to achieve it. Local government body Cosla refused to speak to BBC Scotland on-camera but issued a statement saying they would be keen to meet to discuss Mr Swinney's proposal and \"to find out what additional money he is prepared to offer to facilitate such an agreement\".

They are paid by businesses, or landlords if a property is empty. Councils currently keep around 50% of business rates in their area but are expected to keep 75% from 2021. The revised scheme will see local authorities \"take on the risk of decline as well as the reward for any growth\". Rates do not have to be paid on empty businesses for three months, such as when shops close down or move. Andy Preston, independent Mayor of Middlesbrough, said: \"There's a window where we lose money and that adds up to a lot, so we're doing everything we can to help make sure we can sustain businesses. \"We're trying to bring people into town to live here, for leisure, to work, but it's a big battle, and what's worse, an unfair battle. \"We need to get a much fairer system from central government.\" Analysis David Rhodes, Political Correspondent Councils across the country are caught between a rock and a hard place. The rock is that many local high streets are \"dying\" and business rates are just one of the reasons why retailers are struggling. But the hard place - is that business rates generate some \u00a325bn a year for local government to spend. Whilst some councils would like to see business rates reformed or even abolished, many also fear a major overhaul of the business rates system that could see them lose a vital source of income to fund local services. 'We need more support' Some smaller businesses argue the rates system should be reform\n\nSummary:","239":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It was not to make him feel excluded or to warn him away. Instead it was considered a rite of passage, part of the induction rituals doled out to new members of the Florida A&M University marching band, the Marching 100. Thirteen people involved in the abuse have been recently charged, most with hazing resulting in death, a third-degree felony. By definition, hazing is the practice of putting someone in physical emotional distress. \"There's no such thing as harmless hazing,\" says Elizabeth Allen, a professor of education at the University of Maine. Aside from physical violence, it can include sexual coercion, forced alcohol consumption, or dangerous \"pranks\" like forcing people to eat vile food mixtures or consume large amounts of water. Hank Nuwer, author of four books on hazing, says that in America from 1970 to 2012 there was at least one hazing death a year, and often more than one, with a total of 104 deaths. Champion's story has an extreme end, but his experience is not unique: a study conducted by the University of Maine found that 55% of college students experienced some form of hazing. \"That includes fraternities, sororities, marching bands, varsity sports intramural sports and other on-campus clubs and groups,\" says Allen. It's found in the military, athletic clubs and even in some workplaces. 'Bonding and unity' The problem is not uniquely American, says Eric Anderson, an American professor at the University of Winchester in the UK. He says he sees just as much hazing in the UK as in the US. \"When people have sacrificed together, when they've gone through something difficult or painful together, it improves their level of cohesion and commitment to the group.\" The people doling out punishment and those being punished each view hazing as a grand tradition, and do not see the activities they are being asked to do as hazing. \"Their motivations are most often \n\nSummary:","241":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

US officials have acknowledged the loss of the unmanned plane, saying it had malfunctioned. However, Iranian officials say its forces electronically hijacked the drone and steered it to the ground. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the intact condition of the Sentinel tends to support their claim. Iran's Press TV said that the Iranian army's \"electronic warfare unit\" brought down the drone on 4 December as it was flying over the city of Kashmar. Brig General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh, head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' aerospace unit, told Iranian media that the drone \"fell into the trap\" of the unit \"who then managed to land it with minimum damage\". He said Iran was \"well aware of what priceless technological information\" could be gleaned from the aircraft. Nato said at the weekend that an unarmed reconnaissance aircraft had been flying a mission over western Afghanistan late last week when its operators lost control of it. Pentagon officials have said they are concerned about Iran possibly acquiring information about the technology. Iranian media said on Thursday that the foreign ministry had summoned the Swiss envoy to express its \"strongest protest over the invasion of a US spy drone deep into its airspace\". Washington has no diplomatic relations with Iran and US affairs in the country are dealt with via the Swiss embassy in Tehran. A statement said the ministry had asked for an immediate explanation and had demanded compensation from Washington. A report in The New York Times on Thursday said the \"stealth\" drone had been part of a US surveillance programme mapping Iran's suspected nuclear sites. The US and its allies suspect Iran of secretly trying to build a nuclear weapon - something Tehran strongly denies. A recent report by the UN's nuclear watchdog said Iran had carried out tests \"relevant to the development of a nuclear device\".

It is seen by many as the nexus of freedom, sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll which fuelled the countercultural movement of the decade. To mark the anniversary of the legendary gathering we spoke to some of those who experienced the festival first-hand. Jim Shelley was back at home in \"pre-Springsteen\" New Jersey for the summer after his first year at university in the conservative Midwest. The \"suburban white Catholic kid\" was questioning the legitimacy of the Vietnam War and started to think \"the direction the country was heading in politically was wrong\". He had developed an interest in world music and French New Wave cinema, and felt increasingly at odds with mainstream society. \"I felt like an outsider. If you were like me, people didn't like you. People didn't agree with my views on the war,\" he says. \"People thought you were a nerd, or stupid, or strange.\" For the 19-year-old, Woodstock was the first time he felt others shared his world view. \"I had never experienced anything like that before,\" he recalls. \"I remember looking around at the crowds of people like me and thinking, 'Look how many of us there are'.\" Jim describes Woodstock as \"life-affirming, rather than life-changing\". \"The attitudes I had before I went to Woodstock, which were so out of place back home, were confirmed when I was there. Woodstock made me realise I was right and my ideas were legitimate.\" His experience emboldened him and his then girlfriend - now wife - not to conform. \"My wife and I cared about the environment so we used recyclable nappies when our children were born.

Ms Dennett, who has completed several fundraising challenges since the diagnosis five weeks before her 44th birthday, said: \"My next [challenge] will be land-based.\" She was taking part in the Brain Waves challenge, in which the crew set off from Lanzarote.

It is the latest in a legal action against the police that began with an officer being exposed in 2010. Ten women say they were duped into forming long-term relationships. 'Seriously intrusive' The most well-known former officer, Mark Kennedy, infiltrated environmental groups. Ruling on the claims brought under the Human Rights Act against the Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police, the appeal court judges said: \"The establishing and\/or maintaining of an intimate sexual relationship for the covert purpose of obtaining intelligence is a seriously intrusive form of investigatory technique. \"We do not think that it is in issue that it amounts to an invasion of an individual's common law right to personal security and of a most intimate aspect of the right to privacy under article 8 of the convention.\" They ruled that only the IPT can adjudicate on the \"necessity and proportionality\" of techniques used by police spies. The IPT deals with complaints relating to secret surveillance powers. Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson said: \"At first sight, it seems obvious that the IPT has jurisdiction to deal with the human rights claims.\" He added that Parliament clearly intended for human rights proceedings about relationships by undercover police officers to be ruled on by the IPT. \"The proposition that sex is the thing that makes all the difference between a case that is sensitive enough to be required to be heard in a special tribunal and a case which is not so sensitive is absurd,\" he said. \"The reason why the case needs to be heard in the special tribunal is because it relates to undercover operations, arising out of personal or other relationships.\" 'Law needs reviewing' At the heart of the case is the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA), introduced in 2000 to regulate state surveillance - according to BBC home affairs corre\n\nSummary:","245":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The NASPA manages competitive Scrabble tournaments and clubs in North America. The decision is due after weeks of anti-racism protests in the US and around the world. Hasbro, owner of the rights to Scrabble in North America, told The New York Times on Tuesday that the NASPA had \"agreed to remove all slurs from their word list for Scrabble tournament play, which is managed solely by NASPA and available only to members.\" Hasbro has not allowed slurs in its dictionary since 1994. However the association has still permitted them. The NASPA advisory board is set to vote on Thursday. The removal of the words from its vocabulary list could affect online versions of the game. The association licenses its list of words to software developers, according to Mashable. NASPA Chief Executive John Chew told the BBC: \"The vote is at this point a necessary formality, and we will be removing all offensive words from our lexicon. We will be reviewing our candidate list of 236 such words carefully to make sure that they all need to be deleted, which may take an additional week or two after the decision.\" Addressing members in a letter, Mr Chew said: \"When we play a slur, we are declaring that our desire to score points in a word game is of more value to us than the slur's broader function as a way to oppress a group of people. \"I don't think that this is the time for us to be contributing divisively to the world's problems.

Before the vote, Fidesz officials had threatened to pull out of the EPP if it was suspended. However, Mr Orban reacted defiantly, saying \"we cannot be excluded\". Although the suspension stops short of complete expulsion, the decision comes as a blow for the Hungarian leader on the eve of an EU summit. After a heated debate and 190 votes in favour of suspension, the party decided to accept the result, with Mr Orban even suggesting that it was a \"joint decision\". But the penalties for Hungary's ruling leader are clear and immediate. He will not appear at a meeting on Thursday with other EPP leaders such as Germany's Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz ahead of the summit. \"Practically it means that Fidesz cannot any more present candidates for posts in the party, they cannot vote any more for any kind of EPP assembly and they are even not any more allowed to participate in any meeting,\" said EPP leader Manfred Weber. But the vote is also potentially bad news for the centre-right bloc, which faces European Parliament elections at the end of May. While the EPP is an alliance of about 80 parties, Fidesz has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, making it the country's dominant political force. The party will now be assessed by three \"wise men\" who will decide whether it is in breach of the centre-right bloc's values. The length of the suspension is unclear, but it will last beyond the European elections. Why has Fidesz been suspended? The final straw for many centre-right parties in Europe was an anti-immigration poster campaign that featured unflattering photos of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and billionaire philanthropist George Soros. Mr Soros is a regular target of Fidesz, which accuses him of encouraging illegal migration to Europe. Mr Soros funds civil society groups that help migrants or defend human rights.

Apple iPhones running its iOS software were bought by 28% of new smartphone buyers. Nielsen said the figures could change quickly if Apple launches the iPhone 5 next month as expected. Writing on the Nielsen blog, analyst Don Kellogg said the smartphone market as a whole was growing as more and more people plump for the sophisticated devices over feature phones. Among those who bought a phone over the last few months, 58% picked up a smartphone. Higher, noted Mr Kellogg, than the 43% seen among all phone buyers Nielsen has tracked since August 2010. Among all smartphone subscribers, rather than those new phone owners, Google's Android is the most popular platform with 43% owning one. Apple is second with 28% and Blackberry third at 18%. Other platforms, including Nokia, Microsoft, and Samsung are lumped into the remaining 11% share. Mr Kellogg speculated that the market share mix could see some volatility over the next few months in the run up to Christmas - typically a time when a lot of people splash out on new handsets. Apple's expected launch of the iPhone 5 could also bump up spending, though he added any expectations about growth should be \"tempered by the fact that many consumers are unwilling or unable to break their service contracts before they expire\".\n\nSummary:","250":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The report also said affordable extra help, such as advice on grants and loans, should be made available to common grazings committees, young and new entrants as well as more established crofters.

Dr Bruce Alberts, editor of Science, was asked by US security advisers not to publish parts of the work because of concerns it could help terrorists to develop a biological weapon. But he says it is important to get the research out quickly to scientists and health officials monitoring the virus. Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Vancouver, he said: \"Our position is that, in the absence of any mechanism to get the information to those scientists and health officials who need to know and need to protect their populations and to design new treatments and vaccines, our default position is that we have to publish in compete form.\" 'Academic freedom' The controversy is centred on two research papers - one of which was submitted to Science, the other to another leading journal, Nature, last year. They showed that the H5N1 virus could relatively easily mutate into a form that could spread rapidly among the human population. The studies prompted the US National Security Advisory Board for Biotechnology (NSABB) to ask both journals last November to redact some sensitive parts of the research, which it believed could be used by terrorists to develop such a virus. The request caused outcry among some scientists who believed that it was an infringement of academic freedom. Some pointed out that the scientists had given presentations about their work at conferences and the details were already widely circulated, so redaction would have little purpose. The scientists who carried out the research, and the journals concerned, have been considering the request and listening to suggestions as to how the research results could be redacted in the scientific journals, but distributed to bona fide researchers who urgently need the information\n\nSummary:","252":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

In March 2017, Albayrak emailed Apple's security team, claiming to have breached millions of iCloud accounts. He posted a video on YouTube that appeared to show him breaking into two accounts. He threatened to sell the account information, dump his database online and reset the accounts, unless Apple paid his iTunes gift card demand. Albayrak also said he would accept $75,000 worth of crypto-currency, but later increased this to $100,000. He was arrested at his home in north London about two weeks after sending his threat.

Going shopping was one of few \"channels of escape\" for victims, she said. Calls to domestic abuse help lines have increased in the past three weeks. The government has set aside an extra \u00a32m to support domestic abuse services while the Home Office has launched an initiative called 'You Are Not Alone' to help those experiencing domestic abuse. Speaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said those at risk would get the \"right support\", adding \"there are so many costs to this awful epidemic and this is sadly one of them\". Earlier, Dame Vera told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that the pandemic posed a unique challenge in terms of identifying and protecting vulnerable women and men. She said there was evidence of a marked increase in killings of women by men, including by current or previous partners, since strict restrictions on people's movements were imposed on 23 March. She said there had been, on average, five such deaths a week since then, much higher than the average of two a week over the equivalent period in previous years. She said the figures - which were based on research by the Counting Dead Women project - showed the \"scale of the crisis\".

John Cooper QC told the hearing at the Old Bailey the main issue was \"simply who pulled the trigger\". A first inquest in 2002 ended with an open verdict, but a fresh inquest is due to take place next year. Pte Gray was one of four young soldiers to die from gunshot wounds at the army base between 1995 and 2002. His family won the right to apply for a new inquest last year after Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC said he was satisfied fresh evidence had come to light. 'Drinking dens' Representing the Gray family, Mr Cooper said there was evidence of \"systemic failings\" at Deepcut and allegations of a \"lack of procedure and lack of protection for these young recruits\". He said some trainees were \"treated with a degree of favour\". Those soldiers were allowed off site to consume alcohol in \"drinking dens\" before returning to barracks, he said. \"With the problems drink brings there may be a problem here,\" Mr Cooper said. \"Here there is potentially a situation where another trainee pulled the trigger on Mr Gray.\" Mr Cooper added: \"There is a degree here of state involvement given that the trainee was, and could be argued to be, connected to the state - a trainee of the armed forces.\" The family's application for a jury inquest was rejected. Judge Coroner Peter Rook QC said: \"In my view, a reasoned decision and reasoned findings of fact by a coroner sitting alone will be in the best interests of the interested parties and the public.\" A further pre-inquest hearing will be held on 5 October.\n\nSummary:","259":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It includes 35,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. The figures have been revealed in a finance report, showing NHS services are heading for a \u00a3931m deficit this year, twice what was planned. The overspend by hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services has been partly blamed on the need to cover the vacancies with overtime and temporary staff. The accounts to the end of December also show higher than expected spending on paying the private sector to see NHS patients in an attempt to relieve the pressure on hard-pressed A&E units. Despite the overspend, the forecast is still some way short of the record \u00a32.45bn deficit accrued in 2015-16. Can't find your health trust? Browse the full list Rather search by typing?

Nigel Edwards of the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was \"dangerously\" short of staff. \"In some ways, the lack of crucial workers in the NHS is an even bigger problem than the lack of funding. \"We can sign a cheque and bring back more money on-stream if the will is there, but there is no button to push which will suddenly bring us tens of thousands of qualified extra staff.\" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies added: \"All the evidence shows that standards of patient care rise and fall as nurse numbers do. \"That was the lesson from Mid Staffordshire and we cannot afford to forget it.\" Ian Dalton, head of NHS Improvement, the regulator that released the accounts, said the health service was working hard to tackle the problems.

Lawyers argued her mother had poisoned her foetus but appeal judges ruled she had not committed a criminal offence. The case was brought by a council in the North West of England, which cannot be named for legal reasons. It had been argued the woman ignored warnings and drank a \"grossly excessive\" amount of alcohol while pregnant. She consumed eight cans of strong lager and half a bottle of vodka a day, the court heard. Three appeal judges at the Court of Appeal had to rule on whether or not the girl was entitled to a payout from the government-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as a victim of crime. But Lord Justice Treacy said an \"essential ingredient\" for a crime to be committed \"is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - grievous bodily harm on a foetus will not suffice\". 'Hugely important' case The girl, who cannot be named and was referred to in court as CP, suffers with learning, development, memory and behavioural problems. BBC News legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the case was significant because it centred on whether or not a foetus was considered a person, independent of its mother. He said: \"This case was hugely important, because campaigners argued that if the Court of Appeal had said it was possible for a mother to commit a crime by poisoning her foetus with excessive alcohol, it would have had the effect of criminalising pregnant women who drank excessively, knowing the dangers of alcohol to their foetus.\" Foetal alcohol syndrome Heavy drinking during pregnancy can lead to foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol passes across the placenta from the mother to the developing foetus. But the foetus cannot process alcohol effectively until the liver is fully developed and the high levels of alcohol can affect the development of organs and the brain. Children with FAS are born with a range of disabilities, are often shorter than average and some have le\n\nSummary:","261":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A bid had been lodged to add an extra 12 turbines to the 48 already operational on the site. However, the Scottish government has now rejected those as they would \"magnify, intensify and extend\" the impact of the current wind farm. The application to build the first phase was lodged in 2005, prompting a lengthy campaign against the project. Say No To Fallago claimed it was the \"final straw\" and would destroy the last \"unspoiled section\" of the landscape. They were joined by Prof David Bellamy on a protest march against the project. However, in 2011 they admitted defeat when a Court of Session ruling decided the development could proceed. It was opened in 2013 with developers claiming a \u00a33m investment into the local economy and more than 350 jobs created during construction. It has been estimated to meet the energy needs of up to 86,000 homes. Plans to expand the wind farm and extend its operational life were taken to Scottish Borders Council in 2016. It opposed the extension, leaving the final decision with the Scottish government which has now ruled the extra turbines should not be built.

Levy was born in 1956 to Jamaican parents who had travelled to England on the Empire Windrush in 1948. Sir Lenny Henry, who played a slave in the BBC adaptation of her novel The Long Song, said he had \"loved hanging out with this pugnacious woman\". Levy was best known for Small Island, about two Jamaicans who came to England after World War Two, and The Long Song, her last novel. The 2010 novel was nominated for the Booker Prize and was adapted by BBC One last year. Unlike her other four novels, The Long Song was not set in post-war Britain but reached back to early 19th Century Jamaica during the last years of slavery. Sir Lenny wrote in a tribute: \"She was funny, had attitude and was immensely smart.\" Her publisher Headline said it was \"hugely saddened\" by her death on 14 February, adding that she \"had been ill for some time\". The poet Benjamin Zephaniah said of Levy: \"In the future if anybody wants to have a look at how the Windrush generation arrived here and how we the sons and daughters of the Windrush generation survived and are surviving, they have to refer to Andrea's work .\" Actress and director Kathy Burke said Levy was \"such a great writer\" and that The Long Song had been \"the best thing on telly last Christmas\". Levy did not start writing until she was in her mid-30s, after enrolling in a creative writing class at an adult education college in London. In 1994 she published her first novel, Every Light in the House Burnin\u2032, a semi-autobiographical look at a young woman growing up in north London in the 1960s. Before that, little had been written about the lives of Jamaican immigrants and their families. It was not until the release of Small Island in 2004 that her writing really took off, with her fourth novel earning her the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize.

He said the society knew it must have existed as there was documentary evidence, but that it had not been able to find it until now. Mr Waterhouse said: \"In the summer we carried out a student excavation in the cemetery looking for [an] Iron Age and Roman settlement that was known to exist here. \"At the end of the investigation one of our trenches came up with a substantial stone wall while the one behind came up with a great mass of building rubble and medieval pottery. \"We put in a larger trench and came up trumps. We got a substantial medieval wall in the south west corner of the building.\" It is thought the wall belonged to the chapel of a priory founded by the Abbey of Mont St Michel in Normandy around AD1150. Neil Molyneux, Vice President of the Societe Jersiaise, said the priory would have been dissolved on the orders of King Henry V in 1413. He said: \"The site of the priory has been lost for several centuries, so this is a very exciting find and a considerable coup for the Archaeology Section.\" Mr Waterhouse said previously no small medieval priories had been studied in Jersey and only one in the Channel Islands.

But they added they were also responsible for selling all the merchandise on the site. However, debate continued around the slogan's possible effectiveness for promoting the Northern Territory, which has experienced declining tourism numbers since 2000. The word the ad plays on is generally considered misogynistic and highly offensive. But in Australia, it is often not taken as seriously as in other English-speaking countries, sometimes being used almost affectionately. \"Love the new ad\", said one tweet. \"If you need me, I'll be in the #NorthernTerritory,\" said another.

A third of female runners have experienced harassment while exercising alone, according to England Athletics. \"Someone jumped out of a side alleyway and started chasing me [once]. Luckily I was fairly close to home so I just ran as fast as I could,\" Ms Lee said. She recorded body camera footage showing a group of men saying \"I would\" - implying they would want to have sex with her - as she ran past. Fellow runner Lois England, 26, from City of Hull Athletics Club, said she is abused on \"pretty much every run\" when on her own. With restrictions on how many people you can meet during lockdown, many runners now exercise alone. \"Usually I run in a big group of people, so that does make you feel a lot more secure,\" she said. \"It's very rare that people shout at a big group.\" What US female joggers face on every run More stories from across Yorkshire Megan Hatfield, 17, said people make inappropriate comments when they see her exercising. \"Parkruns are cancelled, races are cancelled, you can't go to the track. \"You have no option than to go out on your own,\" she said. Ms Lee said she knew of women who had stopped running alone due to their fear of being harassed. \"I've got friends who this has happened to before and that's actually prevented them from going out running on their own and that's very upsetting,\" she said. England Athletics said half of the women runners it surveyed in 2017 feared for their personal safety.

It adds staff should have breaks often and cold drinks should be available. Ms O'Grady added: \"While many of us love to see the sun, it's no fun working in a baking office or a stifling factory. \"Bosses should do all they can to keep the temperature down. Nobody should be made to suffer in the heat for the sake of keeping up appearances. \"Workers who are unable to dress down in lighter clothing, or who work in offices without air-conditioning, fans or drinking water, are going to be tired, and lack inspiration and creativity.\" There are no laws in the UK about when it is too hot to work, but the TUC would like that to change. It wants the introduction of a new maximum indoor temperature, set at 30 degrees - or 27 degrees for those doing strenuous jobs - with employers obliged to adopt cooling measures when the workplace temperature hits 24 degrees. Fitting in with your peers Despite the TUC's call for staff to be allowed to dress more casually, is this practical in all workplaces? It very much depends on the organisation where you work, says H&M Group behavioural psychologist Prof Carolyn Mair. Vest tops and skimpy dresses may be fine for more progressive industries such as technology, but not appropriate for traditional financial services firms, she says. People wear certain clothes as a way of fitting in with their peers, and as a way of signalling that they identify with the aims of colleagues, she says. \"What we wear is very much a part of our identity,\" Ms Mair says. \"It's a way of saying: 'We expect you to behave in a certain way.'\" But dress codes can be seen as a form of social control, she says. \"The idea is to create uniform behaviour, as well as a uniform look.\" Personally, she is \"not a fa\n\nSummary:","282":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Last year 63% of exam centres signed up for students to get their results that way; this year the figure is up to 76%. Examinations board CCEA said on Twitter that almost 5,000 students in 35 countries logged on in the first 20 minutes after the results went online. Overall, girls achieved better results than boys. Other figures to emerge after the results were released include: Anne Marie Duffy, director of qualifications at CCEA, Northern Ireland's awarding body, said: \"Over time results can fluctuate and this year we have seen a small decrease in the percentage of entries gaining the top grades. \"This is in line with expectations, based on predicted performance for this group of students, and their performance in last year's GCE AS-level exams.\" Biology was the most studied subject, while Media Studies was the only subject to have a significant rise in those sitting the exam. Options Stormont Education Minister, John O'Dowd, said: \"This year there were a record 32,908 entries for A-levels here which represents a 10% rise in entries over the past five years. \"It is encouraging that more pupils are continuing on with their education after the age of 16 and I hope that this trend will continue in the coming years.\" Employment and Learning Minister, Dr Stephen Farry, said young people should investigate all available options. \"Our further education colleges offer a wide variety of foundation degrees and vocational qualifications and further study may prove beneficial, especially in the current economic times,\" he said. \"Apprenticeships are another way to develop specialist skills, giving you the chance to earn while you learn and gain qualifications that are recognised worldwide.\" It is expected that three quarters of pupils in Northern Ireland will use their results to go to university, a much higher proportion than in En\n\nSummary:","283":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Conservative leader of the council, Marco Cereste, said: \"It's going to be great for the city.\" However, Labour councillor Ed Murphy said the scheme would not assist those most in need. \"This is not going to be helping the low-paid and unemployed,\" said Mr Murphy. However, he said he would consider supporting the scheme if the council was to work with a mutual instead of \"private banks which brought the economy down.\" 'Unlock the chain' The LMA has been developed by Sector Treasury Management services, working with Lloyds TSB. In March, five councils in England said they would pilot the scheme. However, Peterborough council said it did not want to wait until a pilot is completed. \"I think it's a way to help people in our city get on the housing ladder, get themselves a home, and we should go for it,\" Mr Cereste said. The council wants to commit an initial \u00a31m and if it works it will invest a further \u00a39m. \"We'd calculated that we could help probably 400 people,\" he said. \"We are talking about first-time buyers, so it means... you're unlocking the chain in many instances. \"Sometimes there are two or three people in the chain so you could unlock 1,200 house sales.\" He also said it would not cost the city's taxpayers. \"We get a decent rate of interest on our money from the banks, and we would need about 10 times the normal amount of defaults for us to start losing money,\" he said. Mr Murphy however, would prefer the council to supply its own loans, which has been done in the past.

Ms Cho, a vice-president of the firm, forced the Incheon-bound flight to taxi back to the terminal in New York. The airline said checking service standards was part of her job, and she had the pilot's backing. But officials said she was a passenger at the time. Local media reports said that a junior attendant had offered Ms Cho macadamia nuts in a bag, instead of serving the nuts on a plate. Ms Cho, daughter of company boss Cho Yang-ho, then questioned the chief flight attendant over in-flight service standards and ordered him off the plane. Korean Air said the plane arrived 11 minutes late, and that the decision to expel the senior flight attendant had been made in consultation with the pilot.

The International Committee of the Red Cross warned in October that Madagascar was at risk of a plague epidemic. The disease is transmitted to humans via fleas, usually from rats. Bubonic plague, known as the Black Death when it killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle Ages, is now rare. Last year, Madagascar had 60 deaths from the plague, the world's highest recorded number. The Pasteur Institute of Madagascar confirmed on Tuesday that tests taken from bodies in the village last week showed that they had died of the bubonic plague. The BBC's Tim Healy in the capital, Antananarivo, says health officials have now gone to the remote area to investigate. There has been a programme to exterminate rats, fleas and cockroaches in Madagascar's prisons to avoid outbreaks of the plague, which is spread because of unhygienic conditions, he says. The Pasteur Institute said there were concerns that the disease could spread to towns and cities where living standards have declined since a coup in 2009 and the ensuing political crisis.

After writing the lyrics with her mother, Ms Cooper's music teacher Christopher Bond wrote the accompanying music. They posted a video of her performing the song online and it \"went through the roof\", Ms Morgan said. A post of her performance on the Autism World Awareness Day Facebook page was viewed 52,000 times and shared by hundreds. Ms Morgan said Mr Bond had been \"like a godsend\" to her daughter. Ms Cooper taught herself to play different instruments in her bedroom for years. She now plays the cornet in Gwaun Cae Gurwen Brass Band in Cwmgors near Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, and is less isolated as a result.

In a court filing last week, she asked for control of money stored in a trust fund set up for Britney's children. She requested the money be moved into accounts for which she is the custodian. If approved, it would transfer the financial assets of the fund to those accounts and require a judge's approval to release them. Britney Spears' finances are currently controlled by her father, James Spears, who has been his daughter's legal conservator for more than a decade due to concerns around her mental health. He temporarily stepped aside from the role overseeing her personal affairs in 2019, citing his own health problems. Some of Spears' fans believe she was forced into the arrangement, and have been running a #FreeBritney campaign. Jamie Lynn Spears has now asked that all the assets of the SJB Revocable Trust be moved into one or more accounts with Fidelity Brokerage Services, which she controls. The trust fund was established by the singer in 2004 to protect her children's future. The new court filing does not explain what role it could play in the singer's protracted conservatorship case. Such an arrangement is usually granted for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, such as those with dementia or some other mental health difficulties. For the last 12 years, Britney's father and attorney have managed her assets and personal life - including being able to restrict her visitors and communicate with doctors about her treatment. That conservatorship has been extended to 2021 despite the singer's lawyers telling the court earlier this month that she is \"strongly opposed\" to her father remaining the sole conservator of her personal and financial well-being. The conservatorship was set up when the star began behaving erratically in 2007 after her divorce from Kevin Federline, and she lost custody of their two children (although she has f\n\nSummary:","292":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Turkish military has stepped up operations against the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is fighting for Kurdish self-rule. The army says it has killed more than 200 PKK militants in the latest fighting. The PKK is regarded as a \"terrorist\" organisation by Turkey, the US and EU. 'Challenging the constitution' The HDP won 59 seats in Turkey's 550-seat parliament in the 1 November elections. It came third, behind Mr Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP). Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Erdogan said Mr Demirtas and other Kurdish leaders would be \"taught a lesson\" by the people and the law. He accused Mr Demirtas of challenging Article 14 of the constitution, which bans activities deemed to \"violate the indivisible integrity of the state\".

It was filmed in the mid-1950s at Castle Leslie in County Monaghan, three years before Sir Patrick began presenting The Sky at Night, one of the world's longest-running TV shows. As with many 1950s alien B-movies, the film has a flying saucer, although most amateur directors back then had to make do with using car hubcaps or frisbees for their special effects. Mr Leslie's resources were more grand; he improvised by putting a Spanish Renaissance shield from his castle on the end of a fishing line and shining mirrors at it. Although the film failed to put Castle Leslie on the showbiz map, it would later come to worldwide attention in 2002 when it was the setting for Sir Paul McCartney's marriage to Heather Mills. Sir Patrick, who would later return to Ireland in the mid-1960s as Armagh Planetarium's first director, says he has no memory of his brief movie career. \"Quite honestly I forget. It was more than 50 years ago - if I saw the film I'd remember,\" he says. The astronomer's interest in space may have been more scientific than Mr Leslie's but the pair remained friends and went on to co-write a spoof book in 1972, How Britain won the Space Race. Desmond Leslie wrote a number of books about UFOs and was an early adopter of electronic music, recording science fiction-inspired songs at his studio in Castle Leslie. He reached his widest audience in 1962 when he punched theatre critic Bernard Levin on live television programme That Was The Week That Was, after taking offence at Levin's review of a play starring his then-wife. He died in 2001.

The former - in Boles' opinion - is Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The latter is Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. It's as if the 2016 US presidential election, where both major candidates were deemed flawed and untrustworthy, is playing itself out again three years later, on the other side of the Atlantic. \"People are cynical and saying that they're fed up on the doorstep,\" Mary Roberts, a Labour candidate in the north Wales constituency of Ynys Mon, told supporters at a rally on Sunday. \"That makes it difficult sometimes.\" Canvassers and activists in the crowd echoed that sentiment. Voters want all of this - Brexit, the election, the nonstop drumbeat of political chaos - to be over and done with. Welcome to the 2019 general election, a pre-Christmas present few British voters seem anxious to unwrap.

It's an election he asked for, yet the campaign hasn't been without its bumps in the road. Critics have raised doubts about his trustworthiness - an important question, given that Johnson is trying to assure voters that he can get the UK out of the European Union by the end of January and then follow that up with successful negotiation for a new trade relationship. They cite a string of broken promises or misleading statements, including on healthcare and his Brexit plan for Northern Ireland. He has also been criticised for refusing to discuss the number of children he has, an issue that was even picked up in the US media. \"The theme running through our questions is trust,\" BBC broadcaster Andrew Neil said of an interview he had hoped to conduct with Johnson. \"And why, so many times in his career in politics and journalism, critics and sometimes even those c\n\nSummary:","296":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Nobody takes any notice of my notes!\" he storms with mock indignation. In reality, the former stand-up comedian has a lot to smile about. One Man, Two Guvnors, his twist on Carlo Goldoni's 1746 comedy The Servant of Two Masters, has been a runaway success since it first opened at the National Theatre in May 2011. One review described as \"the funniest show in the western world\". The play has just been nominated for five Olivier theatre awards. Bean's slapstick adaptation tells the story of gluttonous minder Francis Henshall juggling errands for two bosses in 1960s Brighton. The show has toured the UK and is now on its second West End run. The original London cast - led by James Corden - will open the show at New York's Music Box Theatre on 18 April. Last week the play opened in its new West End home with Corden's former understudy, Owain Arthur, taking over the lead role. \"We decided not to go with another big name because then it becomes Blur v Oasis,\" says Bean. \"People would say 'Owain's not famous' and we'd say 'Who gives a damn? Can the play stand up?' The play goes on, Owain's brilliant and that's it. Owain will be famous for what he's doing now.\" The imminent Broadway transfer means Bean's work on the play isn't over yet. \"I go for the previews, and rewrite the jokes for the morning afterwards when they don't work for the audience,\" he says. \"I'm just being pessimistic.

Shaz, 18, who was cared for by non-Muslims, told the BBC: \"I felt like I didn't belong and I had to be white.\" Children's minister Michelle Donelan said: \"I'm extremely concerned... I think we're letting down children.\" The BBC has analysed figures from Ofsted, which has data from 146 of the 153 local authorities that provide fostering services in England. As of 31 March 2019 there were 54,870 children in foster care in England - 76% were white, 23% were BAME. The analysis found 99 authorities - 68% of the 146 - had a shortage or undersupply of foster carers from a BAME background.

He was never placed with a Muslim foster family and many of his care staff were white. \"It was weird because, being Muslim, I eat halal meat and I go to the mosque and stuff like that, but then when I transitioned into being in care they didn't know what that meant. \"In quite a lot of circumstances they would give me pork and stuff but then I wouldn't eat it and I would explain to them I wasn't going to eat it but then I would get into arguments and it was like 'you can't force feed me'. \"It felt like there was something wrong with me, something wrong with the colour I was.

The Saltdean Lido Community Interest Company (CIC) has been granted a 60-year lease to operate the pool by Brighton and Hove City Council. The 1930s art deco structure is the UK's only Grade II*-listed lido. The lido is to be restored by Sir Terence Conran's design firm after it won a competitive tender in which a number of companies submitted proposals. The grant of \u00a3439,800 will be used to restore the main swimming pool, install a new plant room, landscape the grounds and for temporary changing rooms and toilets. 'Monumental step' The owners have already submitted a planning application to Brighton and Hove City Council for permission to renovate the site. They expect about 300,000 people will use the lido next summer after completion of phase one of the \u00a35m project. The CIC has also submitted a bid to the Heritage Lottery Fund for \u00a34.9m with a decision expected in January. Rebecca Crook, director and chair of Saltdean Lido CIC, said: \"This is a monumental step in us achieving our vision of restoring the entire site and bringing it back into full use for the benefit of local residents and visitors alike.\" Plans announced in 2010 to partially demolish the 1930s Grade II* listed complex and build flats were rejected.

When they were paid, some of the cash was put into one envelope, or two, and earmarked as savings. The stakes were raised for some when a picture of their children was attached to one of the envelopes. Dipping into those savings for everyday spending - by ripping through the image of their sons and daughters - made them feel guilty. So, as they tried to avoid this guilty feeling, the amount they saved increased. Can't save, won't save This is more than just a theory. In the UK today, millions of people set money aside in a separate savings account to stop them spending it day-to-day. Financial technology companies such as Wagestream, which allows workers to extract pay and save directly from their wages before payday, are trying out the use of reward and guilt. It allows users to load an image of their savings goal onto the app, such as a car or a holiday destination. The more they save, the clearer the image becomes. If they withdraw money, the picture starts to disappear. \"It subtly reinforces the reality of what they are doing and can materially influence their behaviour,\" says Peter Briffett, co-founder of Wagestream. The reality, and the concern for many, is that the UK has lost its savings habit. This graph shows that experts are not expecting it to return any time soon. The proportion of income left after taxes that we save is known as the savings ratio. For the last couple of years, the UK has saved about 4% of disposable income. In the 1990s, it came close to 15%. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts for the government, predicts it will stay at or around this 50-year low for the next five years at least. It is not all bad. The OBR, the Bank of England, and others expect interest rates to stay low too. Many people are deciding to pay off debts when the costs are low, rather than save when the rewards (in interest \n\nSummary:","300":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A court hearing on Wednesday heard Tower Hamlets Council failed to carry out an annual safety check which would have identified rot in the tree. The council was fined having previously admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. It was also ordered to pay costs of \u00a36,204. Alexia went into cardiac arrest and died in hospital about an hour after the equipment she was playing on collapsed on 17 July 2015. Last year, the council signed off a \u00a32m \"extraordinary cost item\" from its children's services budget to cover the potential fine and legal costs, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Speaking at a full council meeting on Wednesday, Tower Hamlets' chief executive Will Tuckley said he wanted to \"again apologise to Alexia's mother, friends and family for their unbearable loss and express our profound regret that Alexia died in Mile End Park where she should have been safe\". The Crown Prosecution Service previously ruled that while there had been a series of failings, it would not pursue manslaughter charges against the council over the child's death. An inquest in 2018 found \"inappropriate wood\" had been used in the swing's structure. The child's mother, Vida Kwotuah, previously said she was \"truly disappointed to learn how chaotic and disorganised management was within the council, which no doubt led to the missed annual inspection in 2014\".

They say molecular tests suggest one patient who died in Rio de Janeiro between 19 and 25 January had Covid-19. The first previously known death in Brazil was that of a man on 16 March. The scientists also say their research suggests the virus was being spread from person to person in Brazil in early February - weeks before the country's popular carnival street parties kicked off. According to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally, Brazil now has more than 170,000 cases of coronavirus, second only to the US in the Western Hemisphere. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the Americas are the currently at the centre of the pandemic. \"Around the world we have seen that the warnings we put out right from the start, very, very early on, were not seen as warnings about a very serious, lethal disease,\" WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said about the high number of cases in Brazil and the US. Difficult task of tracing outbreak When Brazil was preparing for carnival, coronavirus had already spread to more than 20 countries. But the sense was that this part of the world was not affected - so why call off Brazil's biggest party and its main tourism draw?

The Proud Boys are an all-male group of self-proclaimed \"Western chauvinists\" with a history of street violence. Verillas - the LGBT-owned brand - says the \"nightmare scenario\" has forced them to pull the kilts from the shelves. Extremist groups in the US often adopt or appropriate items of clothing as quasi-uniforms that indicate their allegiance and make them recognisable to others. Over the weekend, videos on social media showcased a row of Proud Boys in bright yellow Verillas kilts mooning the crowd gathered around them, with \"[expletive] antifa\" written on their bare bottoms. Antifa is a group of mostly far-left activists who have repeatedly clashed with the Proud Boys. Verillas owner Allister Greenbrier - a gay entrepreneur of Scottish descent - expressed shock and dismay that his brand was associated with the group. \"I was appalled, angry and frustrated because they are the opposite of everything our brand stands for,\" he told the BBC, noting that the men had initially claimed to be a metal band looking for kilts. \"I was quite angry. I had to calm down a bit, but we decided we really didn't want their money.\" In a message on Twitter, Verillas announced a donation of $1,000 (\u00a3745) - a sum exceeding the Proud Boys' purchase - to the anti-racism organisation National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Aside from pulling the offending garment off its racks, the company is also offering free colour exchanges for anybody who had previously purchased its yellow kilts.

It was found by a farmer in 1965 near the village where the artist spent his final days. It was approximately the right age, and used the same calibre of bullet van Gogh shot himself with. However, doubts have been raised about the authenticity of the gun. On 27 July 1890, the troubled Dutch artist walked into a field near Auvers-sur-Oise, a village a few miles north of Paris, and shot himself in the chest. The pocket-sized revolver had limited power, and it took days for van Gogh to die from his injuries. More than seven decades later, a corroded gun was found in a field behind the chateau where he stayed. Analysts suggested that the pistol had been in the ground for between 50 and 80 years. But doubt has been cast on whether the revolver, which had previously been kept at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, was the actual weapon van Gogh used to kill himself. The Van Gogh Institute, which oversees the house where he saw out his final days, criticised the auction. \"Nothing suggests that the remains (of the gun) are formally linked with the death of Van Gogh,\" it said in a statement, deploring the \"commercialisation of a tragedy which deserves more respect\". Art Auction, which sold the weapon, admitted that there was no way of guaranteeing the gun was the same one, but said the dates matched up. \"Technical tests on the weapon have shown the weapon was used and indicate that it stayed in the ground for a period that would coincide with 1890,\" it said. \"All these clues give credence to the theory that this is the weapon used in the suicide.\" Other strange historic items sold at auction A slice of the Queen's wedding cake A piece of cake from the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh - then Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten - was sold for \u00a3672 in 2013.

The position has been vacant since Douglas Bain's term of office ended in 2017. Mr Kennedy has been a solicitor for 37 years and is said to have \"extensive investigative experience\". The letter, sent to all MLAs on Tuesday, states that the assembly commission has asked the business committee to schedule a motion for debate on 21 July, and will require MLAs to approve the formal appointment. If MLAs support the motion, Mr Kennedy's appointment will be \"effective immediately,\" the letter adds. The role of the commissioner is to act independently to investigate formal complaints against MLAs for alleged breaches of the code of conduct. But the post has been empty since Douglas Bain stood down from the role in 2017 after his five-year term ended. The position could not be filled at that time because the power-sharing executive had collapsed and since then, complaints have continued to be made but there has been no-one to investigate them. The role has come back into the spotlight following complaints by some MLAs about Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill's attendance at the funeral of senior IRA figure Bobby Storey. Last week, Mr Bain said it was \"frankly ridiculous\" that the public could make a complaint about Ms O'Neill or any other MLA, but nothing could happen as the post remained unfilled. It is understood the standards commissioner will be able to retrospectively investigate any complaints made against MLAs before his term begins, so long as they were submitted within six months of the alleged breach of the code. Who is Paul Kennedy? Mr Kennedy has been a qualified solicitor for 37 years, engaged in private practice for 32 of those years and 28 as principal of his own firm. The letter from the assembly commission to MLAs says Mr Kennedy has \"extensive investigative experie\n\nSummary:","317":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It said 19 out of 70 were not working properly and that could increase depending on weather conditions. It added that the council should support police and communities wanting cameras and help them find funding. The study came after questions arose about the viability of the council continuing to provide and fund public space CCTV. It currently operates 70 cameras across Duns, Hawick, Galashiels, Kelso, Peebles, Eyemouth, Selkirk and Melrose. They are operated by Police Scotland but maintenance costs are met by the council. 'Becoming obsolete' The local authority's policy is currently to continue their upkeep until they are beyond economic repair. A council report said replacing the current analogue systems like for like was not recommended as the technology was old and \"becoming obsolete\". \"Replacing the current systems with the latest high-definition technology will require a large capital investment,\" it added. It said that police supported the use of CCTV as an \"effective tool for their work\" but were not in a position to fund them either. The council is being asked to note that its systems are no longer fit for purpose and agree to shut them down once they are beyond economic repair. However, it said it would help any communities wishing to install, extend or replace CCTV and \"help them find a solution fully funded by those communities\".\n\nSummary:","319":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A government anti-corruption bill that envisages setting up an independent ombudsman has stalled in parliament. Leading anti-corruption activist Anna Hazare says the bill is weak and should be withdrawn. Known as the Lokpal bill, it was passed by parliament's lower house last month but stalled in the upper house. It will now have to be taken up again in the next session of parliament. Parade Ahead of the 63rd Republic Day, Ms Patil said: \"While bringing about reforms and improving institutions, we have to be cautious that while shaking the tree to remove the bad fruit, we do not bring down the tree itself.\" Without referring directly to Mr Hazare, she said that although there were \"short-term pressures\", India could take pride in its democratic record. She added: \"All issues, therefore, must be resolved through dialogue and there can be no place for violence. Negativity and rejection cannot be the path for a vibrant country that is moving to seek its destiny.\" Mr Hazare has vowed to keep up his campaign for a strong Lokpal bill. In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this week, Mr Hazare said: \"Show some courage to bring Lokpal to fight corruption.\" His 12-day anti-corruption hunger strike in August in Delhi became the focus of a national campaign and put pressure on the government to act on the issue. In her address, Ms Patil also marked the \"growing aspirations of the people, coupled with their expectations of immediate solutions\". She said: \"There is also a growing quest for materialism.

Swansea-born, he stood twice in Welsh seats before landing the Lancashire constituency he has held since 1992. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant, who is also gay, welcomed the decision. Mr Bryant, who sits on the board of ParliOut, tweeted: \"Glad to see Nigel Evans is 'coming out'. An open secret in Parliament for years\". Gay rights charity Stonewall, which helped set up ParliOut, has welcomed Mr Evans' decision. Mr Evans's agent said the MP had given an interview to a Sunday newspaper to explain why he was being open about his personal life. It means the number of openly gay MPs in the Commons is 22, with more than half Tories. Mr Evans grew up in Swansea, graduating in politics from the city's University College and joined the Conservatives when he was 17. A member of the former West Glamorgan County Council from 1985-1991, he unsuccessfully stood for Parliament in Swansea West in 1987, Pontypridd in 1989 and Ribble Valley in 1991.

Many try repeatedly to pass the ENA's notoriously tough entrance exams, so desperate are they to get in. But the Strasbourg school's most powerful ex-pupil is reportedly turning against it. Determined to quell the gilets jaunes (\"yellow vest\") protest movement, President Emmanuel Macron has proposed abolishing the ENA, according to the text of an upcoming speech leaked to French media. \"If we want to build a society of equal opportunity and national excellence, we must reset the rules for recruitment, careers and access to the upper echelons of the civil service,\" he is quoted as saying. \"That's why we will change the system of training, selection and career development by getting rid of the ENA and several other institutions.\" The president's office has declined to comment on the leaked text. French media say it was to be in his address to the nation marking the conclusion of a two-month great debate. But the speech was postponed because of the Notre-Dame fire. What is the ENA? It was established in 1945 by then French President Charles de Gaulle, in the immediate aftermath of World War Two. It was created \"with a spirit of reconstructing France and renovating the state\", said anthropologist Ir\u00e8ne Bellier of France's National Centre for Scientific Research. \"The ideology was you'd raise a group of people capable of acting in the public interest.\" Prior to its creation, each ministry had its own hiring process and standards, resulting in closed networks that almost exclusively favoured the upper class.

The figure includes the \u00a344m spent on a public inquiry. Plaid Cymru said it was an \"obscene amount of public money\" but Transport Minister Ken Skates said it would not be wasted. Mr Drakeford said the scheme would damage the Gwent Levels, despite a planning inspector saying there was a compelling case for the project. Instead, a commission of experts will look at \"innovative\" ways of solving congestion issues, reporting back initial findings in six-months' time. Mr Skates said the commission will examine all 28 alternatives seen at the planning inquiry. All had been rejected by the inspector Bill Wadrup. Ministers will also look at the operation of the M4's junctions to reduce the load on the Brynglas tunnels in Newport. It will be part of a set of short-term measures, including more traffic officers, dedicated on-call recovery vehicles, and a driver behaviour campaign \"to make best use of the available road space\". It is understood that the Welsh Government will not rule anything out of the commission's deliberations - including shutting junctions. The commission will be chaired by Lord Burns - current chairman of media regulator Ofcom and a former permanent secretary to the UK Treasury.

It is believed the decision was taken at a meeting of the government's National Security Council on Tuesday. One minister said leaking from the council was \"simply not acceptable\". The senior minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that leaking the conversations was \"extraordinary...the security council is the holy of holies\". There were \"huge concerns\" over \"getting into bed\" with the telecoms giant, the minister said. What was the leak about? Ministers were deciding whether or not to allow equipment from Huawei to be used to construct the new 5G data network - a decision that could have long-term consequences for national security. There are fears that giving the Chinese company a key role could open the UK network to espionage. But Huawei has denied there is any risk of espionage or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. According to the Daily Telegraph, Huawei would be allowed to help build the \"non-core\" parts of the UK's 5G network, such as antennas. Prime Minister Theresa May chaired the meeting of the National Security Council on Tuesday, where it is believed the decision was taken. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and Number 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. Why does the leak matter? The National Security Council is where senior ministers with key security roles meet - and their talks are supposed to be confidential. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was \"real upset\" that the discussions had leaked. A senior minister said there had to be a \"full and proper leak inquiry\", with those responsible losing their jobs if necessary.

Mrs May told Hassan Rouhani she had \"serious concerns\" about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's imprisonment. The British-Iranian was jailed for five years in 2016 after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also had his first face-to-face meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif. \"I again pressed for Nazanin's swift release - she deserves to be back at home with her family,\" Mr Hunt said in a statement. He said it was \"not acceptable to detain innocent people arbitrarily at the cost of enormous human anguish\". Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 after visiting her family on holiday. She has always maintained the visit was to introduce her daughter Gabriella to her relatives. The mother-of-one from Hampstead, north London, was recently reunited with her four-year-old daughter during a three-day temporary release.

US President Donald Trump described the acceleration as \"amazing\", claiming it as proof his policies are working. But many analysts cautioned that growth could cool in coming months. \"In one line: Looks great; won't last,\" wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. What boosted growth? Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending rose by 4% in the second quarter, up from the 0.5% rate seen in the previous three months. Exports also grew by more than 9%, the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 2013. Economists say that figure, which contributed more than 1% to the GDP gains, was inflated in part by farmers seeking to get ahead of new trade tariffs on items such as soybeans. In July, the US and China imposed tariffs on $34bn of the other country's goods. Canada, Mexico and the European Union also imposed new duties in recent weeks on some US exports in retaliation for US tariffs on steel and aluminium. Is this \"amazing\"? The US economy expanded at an average annual growth rate of 2.2% between 2012 and 2017. That pace has picked up more recently after a long stretch of job gains that has driven unemployment to near record lows. President Trump said the White House had to \"do a lot of things\" to get the economy going again. He pointed to new tax cuts, de-regulation, increased government spending and the continuing trade negotiations. \"We've accomplished an economic turnaround of historic proportions,\" he said. While Friday's report showed the US economy accelerating, the gains were in line with analyst forecasts - and were not out of proportion with some quarters in previous years. In 2014, for example, the economy rose at an annual rate of 5.1% in the second quarter and by 4.9% in the third quarter. Compared with the second quarter of 2017, the economy grew by 2.8% in the April-June period.

The authority said the road was expected to remain closed until Saturday evening at the earliest. Traffic has been diverted from Dale End via the Buildwas bypass while engineers carry out stabilisation work. Jiggers Bank was closed for about two weeks last month while essential maintenance work was carried out. Mr Rushden, the council's structures and geotechnics team leader, said the location of the rock fall was not where the maintenance was done. Stabilisation work He said the incident was probably the result of \"recent weather changes we are having - particularly heavy rain fall and the start of a cold snap\". \"We had about a tonne of rock drop off the rock face down on to the carriageway. It's subsequently been cleared but obviously we are not prepared to open the road until such a time it's actually safe to do so,\" he said.

Four of the Greenpeace activists had tried to board a Gazprom oil rig on Wednesday, to protest against drilling. Russia accused Greenpeace of violating an exclusion zone around the rig, but the group said its ship was in international waters. Greenpeace published photos that it said showed Russian security personnel in balaclavas confronting the activists with guns and knives after abseiling from helicopters onto the Dutch-flagged Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace says planned drilling at Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya rig in the Barents Sea threatens a unique and fragile environment - a claim denied by Moscow. 'Entirely peaceful' \"The safety of our activists remains our top priority and we are working hard to establish what is facing them,\" said Ben Ayliffe, head of Greenpeace International's Arctic oil campaign. \"They have done nothing to warrant this level of aggression and have been entirely peaceful throughout,\" he said. Greenpeace dismissed claims that a safety pod on the ship in any way resembled a bomb. The group of activists being held includes six Britons. A spokeswoman for the Murmansk region's border guards told local media that the Arctic Sunrise's captain had already been questioned, and the activists were being taken to court for \"further legal procedures\". The Russian foreign ministry earlier accused the group of \"aggressive and provocative\" behaviour. Moscow also said that its coastguard vessel had to fire warning shots across Arctic Sunrise. The Gazprom project is Russia's first effort to extract oil from the Barents Sea. Prirazlomnaya is scheduled to begin production by the end of the year.

Guernsey's Treasury and Resources Department has asked the States for permission to guarantee a loan or lease for the airline. Flybe, the other carrier on the route, announced it would stop flying the route from 29 March 2014 after agreeing to sell its Gatwick slots to Easyjet. The security of links between the island and London was one of the main reasons behind the States' purchase of the Aurigny Group in 2003. By the end of 2012 the airline had made accumulated losses of \u00a312.5m. Treasury and Resources Minister Gavin St Pier said: \"Aurigny is already the market leader on the Gatwick route, carrying just under 200,000 passengers last year. \"However, whilst it does have some current spare capacity, there is no practical way for it to accommodate the 146,000 passengers carried by Flybe in 2012 without expanding its own services. \"Both the department and the airline recognise the strategic importance of the Gatwick route to the island. \"It is essential that there is confidence a good service capable of meeting current demand will be maintained and that passengers can see we are absolutely committed to ensuring this is the case.\" A treasury spokesman said the air links were a \"major factor in the long-term success\" of the island's finance and business services, which generate more than 50% of the island's gross domestic product.

The past week has seen increased violence. Israel retaliated for the rocket attack by Palestinian militants in Gaza, and three Palestinians died in border protests. The reopening of the crossings came amid mediation efforts by Egypt. Restrictions on fishing off the coast of Hamas-ruled Gaza have also been lifted, the Times of Israel reports. But the fragility of the \"calm\" negotiated by Egypt was illustrated by further overnight firing, though no-one was hurt. Israel said five rockets were launched from Gaza at the Eshkol region but it has not been confirmed which group carried out the attack. Israel fired on Hamas posts in response. The rocket attack which prompted Monday's border closure and the Israeli military response struck a house in a village near Tel Aviv leaving seven people injured. Tens of thousands of Palestinians protested along the Gaza border on Saturday, marking one year since the start of border demonstrations. The protests are to push for the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to ancestral homes in what is now Israel. According to Palestinian officials, three protesters were shot dead by Israeli troops during the protests, and another another was killed earlier on Saturday. The Israeli Defense Forces said explosive devices had been thrown over the border fence. Israeli forces had responded with \"riot dispersal means\" and live bullets. Israel says Hamas is a terrorist group and accuses it of using the demonstrations as a cover to cross into its territory and carry out attacks. According to the UN, at least 189 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed in similar protests between March and December 2018. The latest Egyptian-mediated negotiation saw Hamas agree to ensuring the protests do not escalate in return for Israel allowing the flow of goods across the Gaza border to resume, Palestinian officials say.\n\nSummary:","335":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Devon and Cornwall Police said additional officers were on duty. Firefighters, who were due to strike, may call off their action. The Fire Brigades' Union (FBU) said discussions were taking place and it was monitoring the Environment Agency's information about the threat of flooding. Recall to duty FBU members were due to take industrial action between 06:30 and 08:30 GMT as part of their ongoing dispute with managers over pension changes. There is an agreement that striking firefighters can be recalled to duty, on a voluntary basis, in the event of a major incident that includes a serious risk to public safety. An emergency management centre was due to open in Truro, Cornwall, at midnight. Two people died earlier this week - a woman in north Devon and a man in Cornwall - after they were swept out to sea in stormy conditions. The Environment Agency said people should protect themselves and their belongings, but should not put themselves in danger. \"The one piece of advice, given the fatalities we've had recently, I'd give is don't get close to the coast,\" area manager Alan Burrows told BBC News. \"Keep away and look from a distance. We've had wave watchers getting too close and it's really dangerous.\" In Cornwall, Falmouth Coastguard said a man, who is believed to have been watching the surf, managed to escape from his car shortly before it was washed into the sea at East Portholland, near Portscatho. He was not injured. Rest centres will also be set up across the region to accommodate people who are flooded or have to leave their homes.

Her organisation tracks media reports on school threats and incidents. It found a 12% increase in threats to schools between the autumn school semesters of 2016 and 2017, and a 59% rise in violent incidents. But what has alarmed the group is that they have tracked almost 400 cases since the 14 February attack. The Ohio-based network has seen up to 65 threats to US schools a day, compared with a daily average of 11 before. \"We always know there's an uptick after an event like [Florida's school shooting] - a contagion effect, a copycat effect,\" Ms Klinger, who has a 28-year career in education, said. \"But this is a significant spike.\" Ninety minutes after the gunman, alleged to have been Nikolas Cruz, killed students and three teachers in Parkland, Florida, there was a new threat in Brooklyn, New York. Two 16-year-old boys are alleged to have posted a picture on social media platform Snapchat. One was posing with what looked like an assault rifle, New York police told the BBC. They had threatened to attack their charter school and captioned the photograph with \"Don't come to school tmw\", prosecutors said according to local media. Two days later, a security guard at a California high school overheard a student threatening to \"shoot up\" his school in the next few weeks after a teacher took away his earphones. The student said he was joking, according to local media, but after a search of his home, police found two semi-automatic rifles similar to the AR-15 used by the Florida gunman, two handguns and 90 high-capacity magazines. 'We cannot afford to not act' While not every threat has proved credible, authorities across the country are not taking any chances. \"We cannot afford to not act on any threat,\" County Sheriff Jim McDonnell told the LA Times.

At its height, about 100 firefighters tackled the blaze at the site which held about 600,000 tyres. The Environment Agency has now said the notice had not been complied with. Firefighters were still tackling the aftermath of the blaze involving the tyres on 23 November 2020, a week after it started. Following a visit to the site on Thursday, the Environment Agency said in a statement: \"The operator has failed to comply with the legal requirements of an enforcement notice, compelling it to remove tyres from its illegal waste site on Spring Mill Street, Bradford. \"Failure to comply with the conditions of an enforcement notice is a criminal offence. This will be considered as part of the Environment Agency's ongoing investigation. \"The Environment Agency is now working with those that have legal responsibility for the land to seek removal of waste from the site.\" More than 20 schools were closed at the height of the fire due to air pollution caused by smoke from the blaze. Public transport services in and out of the nearby Bradford Interchange were also cancelled or diverted, with a number of nearby roads closed. A man aged 59 and a 48-year-old woman had been arrested in North Yorkshire in connection with the blaze. Both have been released on bail and inquiries were still ongoing, West Yorkshire Police said.

A similar project in Suffolk saw alcohol-related street crime drop by nearly 20% in six months, he said. He added vendors and communities were involved in consultations but no start date for such a scheme had been set. 'Sales are legitimate' The proposal would target sales of super-strength beer, lager and cider \"in parts of the city centre and areas around Mutley [two areas popular with revellers] where this might be a useful tool\", Mr Singer said. However, the force did not want to be seen to be meddling with the local economy, he added. \"That's a critical point. The sale is absolutely legitimate, so I'm slightly guarded, because it has to be done in cooperation with partners, vendors and communities,\" he said. \"It's not for the police to ride roughshod, and I don't want people to think that 'If we don't stop, the police are going to close us'. That's not the case at all.\" He said a firm evidential basis needed to be established before any such campaign was introduced. He added that he was talking specifically about the city, and could not comment for the whole force area. 'Wouldn't stop drinking' The idea has the support of police commissioner Tony Hogg. Gina Dormer, chief executive of Broadreach House, which works with alcohol and drug abusers in the city, said drinkers would \"would find a way\" around such a scheme.

But that is proving the prime minister's toughest task to date. Despite her offer to step down if MPs back the deal, the DUP insists it will not vote for it. The party's 10 MPs have voted against the deal twice before, warning that the plan as it stands poses a risk to the integrity of the union of the United Kingdom. They oppose the Irish border backstop in the Brexit deal - the insurance policy to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. The DUP believes if it took effect, it would cause trade differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and create a \"border down the Irish Sea\". As I have written before, the DUP takes pride in placing the union above all else. Although the party has been involved in negotiations with ministers to see what it would take for the DUP to back the deal, it has yet to inch towards giving the government the green light. DUP sources describe as \"offensive\" the suggestion that more money could sway them. The party came to prominence after 2017's snap election when it negotiated \u00a31bn for Northern Ireland in exchange for entering a confidence-and-supply pact. That arrangement is due to expire this year - but the DUP insists it has not asked for cash in these Brexit talks. But what has the party asked for? Officially, the DUP says it won't provide a running commentary while discussions are ongoing. In one sense, though, its stance has shifted slightly. Last November, at the party's annual conference, deputy leader Nigel Dodds demanded that the government \"bin the backstop\". He was supported that day by the appearance of ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who said it was time for the backstop to be \"junked\". More recently, that call has disappeared in favour of calls for legally binding assurances\n\nSummary:","340":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But the Pentagon said that Baghdadi's fate remained unclear. The IS chief allegedly broke a months-long silence in May by releasing an audio message in which he urged Muslims to emigrate to the \"caliphate\" that the group has proclaimed in areas of Syria and Iraq. But his only public appearance on video has been to deliver a sermon in Mosul after IS took the northern Iraqi city last year. Before then, there were only two authenticated photos of him. The IS chief also appears to wear a mask to address his commanders, earning the nickname \"the invisible sheikh\". But Baghdadi - a nom de guerre, rather than his real name - has good reason to maintain a veil of mystery, says the BBC's Security Correspondent, Frank Gardner. One of his predecessors, Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi who headed the most violent jihadist group in Iraq until his death, was a high-profile showman whose secret location was eventually tracked down. He was killed in a US bombing raid in 2006. He may be a shadowy figure, but the organisation he leads is pulling in thousands of new recruits and has become one of the most cohesive militias in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. Highly organised Baghdadi is believed to have been born in Samarra, north of Baghdad, in 1971. Reports suggest he was a cleric in a mosque in the city around the time of the US-led invasion in 2003. Some believe he was already a militant jihadist during the rule of Saddam Hussein. Others suggest he was radicalised during the four years he was held at Camp Bucca, a US facility in southern Iraq where many al-Qaeda commanders were detained. He emerged as the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, one of the groups that later became Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), in 2010, and rose to prominence during the attempted merger with al-Nusra Front in Syria.

Both died from burns after the crash on 10 February, which killed three others. Lawyers for Philip and Marlene Udall, of Southampton, said Papillon and Airbus Helicopters negligently failed to install a crash-resistant fuel tank. The parents' lawsuit said their son could have survived and would not have sustained \"severe and catastrophic burns\" if the Airbus EC130 B4 had been fitted with such a system. Their lawyer Gary Robb said: \"Mr and Mrs Udall deeply grieve for the loss of their son but their primary motivation now is to prevent anyone else from having to suffer the deadly burn injuries as their son did.\" He said the fuel system could have allowed their son to walk away \"injury-free\". After the crash, Papillon announced it would fit 40 of the crash-resistant tanks to its fleet, but Mr Robb said it was \"too little, too late\". The system is not currently mandatory in the US for helicopters certified before 1994. Those named in the action against Papillon Grand Canyon Helicopters and manufacturer Airbus Helicopters are: The family want $195,000 (\u00a3141,000) in damages, plus punitive damages and a jury trial.

Home Office rules say anyone convicted of an offence which could attract a prison sentence cannot be a candidate. Tony Roberts has been confirmed as the Conservatives' new nominee. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 disqualifies a person from standing for election as a police and crime commissioner (PCC) if they have, at any time, been convicted of an imprisonable offence. A number of candidates across England and Wales have been forced to stand down because of previous crimes. Earlier in August, Labour's Bob Ashford said a crime committed when he was 13 had blocked him from the candidacy in Avon and Somerset. And Labour's candidate for Derbyshire, Alan Charles, initially stood down but was reinstated after lawyers advised him a conditional discharge he received for stealing a woman's purse 47 years ago would not bar him from standing. 'Challenge ahead' Speaking at the annual general meeting of the Nottingham Area Conservatives, Mr Quigley said: \"It is with regret that I must stand down following confirmation that an offence committed more than 44 years ago, for which I was fined, bars me from the post.\" Mr Quigley did not disclose what the offence was.

This could open the door to better ways of diagnosing psychiatric conditions including depression, according to lead author Dr Andres Herane-Vives. He has also developed a new type of swab which won't damage the eardrum. Cortisol is known as your \"fight or flight\" hormone. When it sends out alarm signals to the brain in response to stress, it can influence almost every system in the body, from the immune system to digestion and sleep. But its role in disorders including anxiety and depression is not fully understood. Dr Herane-Vives, a psychiatrist at University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, wants to understand what raised or lowered levels of cortisol might indicate. It's early days but he hopes this could eventually help him establish an \"objective biological measure\" for psychiatric conditions. In theory, people with mental health symptoms could have their levels of cortisol tested, and this could help to inform their diagnosis. Currently, mental health diagnosis is largely subjective, so this could provide professionals with an additional tool to help make their assessments more accurate. And a good diagnosis is \"the only way to provide the right treatment\", said Dr Herane-Vives. It could potentially be used to inform who might or might not benefit from anti-depressants. Cortisol can be measured in blood, but this only gives a snapshot of an individual's levels of the hormone in that moment. And since blood tests themselves can be stressful, this can potentially give false positives. Dr Herane-Vives wanted to see if a patient's chronic cortisol levels - what they looked like over a longer period of time - could be measured by looking at tissues in the body where it accumulates. He previously studied whether cortisol could be measured from hair follicles, but to do tha\n\nSummary:","346":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the government was determined to deliver a \"green revolution\". But environmental groups criticised the decision not to include a scrappage scheme or immediate clean air zones. The plan to stop all sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is part of the government's intention for almost every car and van on UK roads to be zero emission by 2050. The government report includes the promise of \u00a340m immediately to start local schemes rolling, which could include changing road layouts, retrofitting public transport or schemes to encourage people to leave their cars at home. The funding pot will come from changes to tax on diesel vehicles and the reprioritising departmental budgets - the exact details will be announced later in the year. If those measures do not cut emissions enough, charging zones for the most polluting vehicles could be the next step. While air pollution has been mostly falling in the UK, in many cities, nitrogen oxides - which form part of the discharge from car exhausts - regularly breach safe levels. Mr Grayling said the new plan showed the government was \"determined to deliver a green revolution in transport and reduce pollution in our towns and cities\". But campaigners say these are the measures that need to be implemented now to tackle environmental and health problems, with air pollution linked to about 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK.

Is this a sign of how those who get a certificate stating they've already had coronavirus might use their privileged position in society? In New York, people are using antibody tests - showing that they have been exposed to the virus and have recovered - as a way of suggesting they are safe to date.

Bailiffs and police moved in at about 0100 BST, although a handful of activists tied themselves to scaffolding. They have now been removed and a fence has been put up around the square. A group of people have continued their protest on the pavement with some brandishing banners emblazoned with \"the dispossessed\". They say they will go back when the fence comes down. However the eviction order is not to be applied to the best-known protester in Parliament Square, Brian Haw. Mr Haw, from Redditch, Worcestershire, who has camped there since 2001, successfully fought to be allowed to continue his demonstration after it was made illegal to hold an unauthorised protest within a square mile of Parliament in 2007. It took about 60 bailiffs four hours to remove all the protesters. Londoner Maria Gallastegui, 51, said: \"No-one was hurt but people were forcibly removed. \"There are certainly a few bruises.\" She added that at least one protester was chained to the scaffolding and another was on top of a lorry containing fencing which was to be put around the square. Anti-war demonstrators and climate change activists had been among those who set up camp in the square, opposite the Houses of Parliament. London Mayor Boris Johnson, who took legal action to remove the Democracy Village, had criticised the spectacle as \"nauseating\".

Georgia Republicans vowed to strip a bill of a jet fuel tax exemption that would benefit the carrier as a result. Delta is one of several firms to end relations with the NRA in recent days. The state House of Representatives and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, passed a sweeping tax package within hours of each other on Thursday that was amended to exclude a $50m (\u00a336m) sales-tax exemption. Governor Nathan Deal tweeted on Friday that he had signed the bill into law. He made no mention of the Delta controversy. Delta irritated state lawmakers on Saturday after it dropped its discount for NRA members in the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. The suspect in the 14 February attack, Nikolas Cruz, was said to be obsessed with guns and bought the semi-automatic rifle he allegedly used at the school in Parkland legally last year while aged 18. The shooting has renewed a national debate on gun control. Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle who spearheaded the pro-NRA initiative warned he would kill the bill if it did not include blocking Delta from tax exemptions. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump met the NRA's top lobbyist at the White House on Thursday. Both sides said they had a \"great\" meeting. The meeting came a day after President Trump stunned members of Congress by accusing them of being \"petrified\" of the NRA. In a departure from his anti-gun control stance, he urged lawmakers to come up with a \"strong\" reform bill. NRA lobbyist Chris Cox tweeted that the president supported the right to bear arms.

He says Ubers have transported key workers to and from their jobs and \"any holiday pay will be a welcome gesture\". \"The pensions are an added bonus,\" he says. However, he views Uber drivers as providing a freelance service, and says they shouldn't be paid while they are waiting for fares. \"Everyone should be entitled to the same benefits. It's greatly welcome, but why should we be treated differently?\" he says. Abul added that he can't see why Uber is guaranteeing a minimum wage. \"I can't ever be on a job for an hour and not be getting \u00a38,\" he says. 'It will make a difference' Zafar Iqbal stopped working for Uber in October last year after a dispute over pay. The Birmingham-based taxi driver could not make Uber work financially, especially with the family commitments that he has. \"The fare was always too little,\" he says, and the commission was \"not cheap\". \"Taxi costs are rising day after day and they [Uber] keep the fares low,\" he says. \"If you go outside the city you're unlikely to get a fare back.\" He says the Uber concessions on holiday pay and pensions \"will make a difference, and it will help\". He adds that taxis are \"really struggling at the moment - there is not much work available\". 'Uber has flooded the market' Abduzak Hadi, who is based in London, was one of the claimants in the court case against Uber. He says that Uber has not gone far enough in its concessions, and that the Supreme Court ruling directed Uber to pay drivers from when they logged onto the app, not from when they \n\nSummary:","352":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He echoed other cabinet members as he warned against complacency, but said things were \"moving in the right direction\" because of the party's decision to go into coalition. Mr Clegg said he wanted to showcase the achievement at his party conference. The Lib Dems meet next week in Glasgow for their annual autumn gathering. He said going into the conference he was \"very proud\" of sticking with the coalition and helping to \"pilot the economy through its darkest hour\". \"A dawn appears to be breaking,\" he went on. \"You shouldn't be complacent but it is moving in the right direction and I don't think that would've happened if we hadn't been there.\" Not about personality Vince Cable, the Lib Dem business secretary, warned earlier this week the government still had more to do to secure a recovery. His intervention came after the chancellor said the UK was \"turning a corner\" and had won the argument with Labour over austerity. Mr Clegg is due to address activists in Glasgow on Monday as he seeks their backing for a motion praising the government's economic record and attacking \"Labour's mismanagement\". But asked on LBC if he could do a deal after the next election with Ed Miliband, he said would not have a problem working with either party in a future coalition. \"It's really very little to do with personal preferences - whether you like this person or that person, or you like this party or that party. \"You've got to follow the instruction manual handed to you by the British people.\" He said he told Gordon Brown after the 2010 election their parties could not go into coalition \"even if we want one\". \"There was no numerical majority for the Liberal Democrats and Labour,\" he added.

Prime Minister Theresa May had called a snap election nine days earlier. It brings the total amount the Weirs have donated to the SNP since 2011 to \u00a34.5m. The couple also donated \u00a33.5m to the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign ahead of the 2014 referendum. The latest figures also showed the Weirs loaned the SNP \u00a3100,000 during the second quarter of 2017. The party has received \u00a32.1m of loans from the couple since 2015 and has paid back \u00a31.6m. 'Lifelong supporters' Mr and Mrs Weir have also used their fortune to fund a number of good causes, including buying a 13-year-old boy a prosthetic leg, and have established a charitable trust to help fund health, sport, cultural, recreational and animal welfare projects. They describe themselves as \"lifelong supporters of independence\". The Electoral Commission said the SNP also received \u00a363,000 as a bequest, and a further \u00a323,000 from leading artist Gerard Burns. Overall, the figures show the party reported \u00a3596,000 in donations between April and June of this year. The figures showed that political parties across the UK were given a record \u00a340.1m in donations ahead of June's general election - with the Conservatives receiving more than all their rivals combined.

The review found five cases where there was avoidable harm and one death. The trust has offered \"sincere condolences and apologies\" but not given further details around the cases. Diane Wake, the trust's chief executive, said they had been open with the families who were given the opportunity to actively engage in the review process. The trust has three hospital sites across the Black Country and maternity services help deliver about 4,600 babies annually. Investigations 'inadequate' The maternity unit's neonatal mortality and stillbirth rates \"compared favourably\" with national figures in 2014-15, the report said. It was also rated as good by the Care Quality Commission at its last inspection. However, in early in 2016, NHS England alerted Dudley Clinical Commissioning Group to concerns about the high number of \"serious incidents\" in maternity services between April 2014 to December 2015. An internal review group was set up along with input from an external consultant to review the 25 cases. The report said that after an \"incident\", it was necessary to establish what happened, what went well and what did not and what actions should be taken as well as involving the patient and their family. Improvement plan The review confirmed investigations were \"inadequate, learning was not identified appropriately, and that there was harm in some cases\". Other findings included cardiotocography heart rate monitoring was misinterpreted in some cases and the wellbeing of an unborn baby was compromised. There were also delays in concerns being escalated in a \"timely manner\" to senior obstetricians and staff being too slow in responding to urgent situations. The report said the trust had since introduced a comprehensive improvement plan for maternity services, including a new training programme around \"serious incidents\". \"This addres\n\nSummary:","355":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The cause of the accident is still unknown.

A petition launched by his father, Mark, to name the bridge at The Myrke as \"Michael's Bridge\" attracted more than 2,500 signatures. He said he hoped the naming would educate people about the dangers of open water swimming. Eton Town Council initially opposed the naming of the bridge, which is owned by the borough council and partially on land owned by Eton College, but voted in favour after a plea by Mr Scaife. Last summer, his son jumped into the river with two friends. When one of the got into trouble he went to their aid but got into difficulty himself. His friends were able to swim to safety. \"Our family hopes that by naming this bridge in Michael's memory it will have the necessary effect to educate and warn people of the dangers of open water swimming and to ensure no other families have to endure the pain we are feeling,\" Mr Scaife said.

Penalties for the guilty are up to 10% of annual revenue. Euribor is a cousin to Libor, which is used to set trillions of dollars of financial contracts from complex financial transactions to car loans. In December, the Commission imposed fines totalling 1.04bn euros on Deutsche Bank, RBS and Societe Generale as part of the same investigation. Barclays escaped a fine as it had notified the Commission of the existence of the cartel, and the others were granted a 10% reduction in their fine for agreeing to a settlement. The EU's competition body said: \"The Commission has concerns that the three banks may have taken part in a collusive scheme which aimed at distorting the normal course of pricing components for euro interest rate derivatives.\" JP Morgan said it had \"co-operated fully with the European Commission throughout its investigation.\" The bank said it believed that the competition concerns were \"without merit\", and added it intended to \"defend itself fully\". HSBC said: \"We intend to defend ourselves vigorously.\" Cartel? The Commission's investigation has centred around concerns that the banks may have manipulated the pricing of interest rate derivatives - financial products which are used by banks to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. The products derive their value from \"Euribor\", a benchmark interest rate which is the eurozone equivalent of Libor. In March 2013, the Commission opened proceedings regarding Credit Agricole, HSBC and JPMorgan, and the investigation as whether they were part of a Euribor rate-rigging cartel is continuing. Should the banks be fined, they will not receive any reduction in penalties, competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said.\n\nSummary:","360":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch expressed concern over the scheme. TfL said the benefits could be \"enormous\". From 8 July data will be collected from devices as they log-on to the wi-fi in more than 260 London Underground stations. By using this data, TfL said it will gain a more accurate understanding of how people move through stations, interchange between services and how crowding develops. The pilot scheme, which cost \u00a3100,000, focused on 54 stations and saw data collected from 5.6 million mobile devices. It revealed a number of results that could not have been detected from ticketing data or paper-based surveys, TfL said. Data will be be made available for app developers, academics and businesses to create new products and services, TfL said. Clear signage, based on TfL's signs about the CCTV across the network, will shortly be installed. Customers who do not want their data to be collected can opt out by turning off the wi-fi on their devices. TfL said it has worked with Information Commissioner's Office to address privacy and transparency concerns. How TfL say the data could help passengers The data collected could in future be used to work out how busy incoming trains are, and help commuters plan their journeys accordingly. If you are starting from Camden Town, for example, and trying to get to Victoria, you could choose the quickest route changing at Warren Street. However, if you are in no rush, an app using the kind of data collected could tell you that you could take the slower but much less crowded route via Embankment, and you may get a seat. This could help people make much more comfortable journeys across the capital at rush hour.

But a report in September found that only 155 out of 455 high-rise buildings with similar cladding to Grenfell have had it replaced. To speed up the process, the Commons Housing Committee said the government should foot the bill for the work in the short term, looking to recover costs from those responsible for historic construction failures at a later date. 'Good faith' Mr Betts, the committee's chair, said the issue had dragged on for too long and urgent action was needed. \"Leaseholders should not have to pay any of the costs.

BAA was told to sell off Stansted and Gatwick, but by then it had already started the process of finding a buyer for Gatwick. It was also ordered to sell off either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports. BAA said it had decided not to challenge the Stansted ruling in the Supreme Court, the last opportunity it had to appeal. \"We still believe that the Competition Commission ruling fails to recognise that Stansted and Heathrow serve different markets,\" it said. Ryanair, which has long been critical of the way BAA ran Stansted and the prices it charges airlines to use the airport, welcomed BAA's decision to proceed with the sale. \"The BAA's seven failed court appeals were nothing more than a blatant attempt to delay the sale while BAA and its Spanish owners, Ferrovial, fattened up its monopoly profits at the expense of airlines, passengers and British jobs,\" said Stephen McNamara from Ryanair. The Irish airline blames lack of competition for the declining passenger numbers at Stansted, which carried 6 million fewer passengers in 2011 than in 2007. Market dominance When the inquiry process was launched five years ago, BAA owned seven UK airports, carrying 60% of all UK air passengers. It had a virtual monopoly over airports in the South East of England, where Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted and Southampton carried 90% of air passengers in the area. Its Scottish airports - Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen - accounted for 84% of airport passengers in Scotland. BAA has recently completed the sale of Edinburgh airport. The Competition Commission said it was \"very pleased\" the sale of the UK's fourth busiest airport could finally go ahead, and would remain closely involved to ensure a suitable buyer. \"We believe that both passengers and airlines will benefit from the introduction of new ownership and increased competition,\" said Laura Carstensen\n\nSummary:","367":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It does not, however, annul his criminal record. Stone was convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He had been due to report to a federal prison in Georgia on 14 July. Speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity on Monday night, Stone said he believed his reprieve had saved him from \"a near-death sentence\". \"I was literally hours away from being sent to a Covid-infested prison in violation of the current Bureau of Prisons and DoJ [Department of Justice] policies,\" he said in his first TV appearance since Friday's presidential clemency. He added: \"I'm 67 years old, I've had a lifelong problem with respiratory problems.\" He also told ABC News he had spoken to Mr Trump on Friday night: \"[He] was very kind; it was a normal conversation. It wasn't stilted, it was brief. He asked how my wife was doing. \"He told me he signed an act of clemency which was a full commutation. He also said that it was a commutation rather than a pardon because Trump believes I did not get a fair trial, and he believes I have a good chance of being exonerated in an appeal - in other words, vacate my conviction, then it's up to the Justice Department if they want to retry the case.\" A presidential pardon would have removed Stone's criminal conviction. Earlier on Monday, Mr Trump told reporters at the White House: \"I am getting rave reviews for what I did for Roger Stone.\" However, some key political figures have expressed shock at the decision: The clemency order was released in full on Monday after US District Judge Amy Jackson had ordered the government to explain the \"scope\" of President Trump's commutation of Stone.

Conwy council deputy leader Ronnie Hughes said: \"I'm not going to lie down like a lap dog and let people stroke my stomach. \"It's foolish to start any negotiations with any other authority at the present time. \"Nowhere in the Williams report does it mention the costs of council mergers. Who picks up that bill? It's an absolute disgrace. \"We've had partnerships (with Denbighshire) in the past over highways - it was a disaster. I vote we stay as we are.\" Councillor Mike Priestley added it would be \"premature\" to begin talks to create a new authority. He said he was worried that council tax bills in Conwy county borough would go up if the two authorities merged. 'Spectators' Council tax bills for a band D home in Conwy council are currently \u00a3918.93, compared to \u00a31,074.09 in Denbighshire. Officials at Conwy council say that a merger of the two councils would probably mean a \"blending\" of the council tax levels, with Denbighshire's council tax coming down and the bill in Conwy going up. They had calculated that the rise in Conwy would be 7.34% at current levels. \"Why should we merge with Denbighshire - they charge more for worse services,\" said Councillor Dave Cowans.

Earlier this month, the government gave the go-ahead for the plant which will power nearly six million homes. It will be the UK's first new nuclear plant in a generation. The meeting was a second attempt at finalising the deal after Prime Minister Theresa May unexpectedly announced in July that she wanted time to scrutinise it. With her approval now granted and the contracts updated, the formal signing took place at a ceremony attended by Business Secretary Greg Clark and French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. China's National Energy Administration director, Nur Bekri, and the chairman of Chinese firm CGN, He Yu, also attended. Mr Clark said that signing the contract was a \"crucial moment\" and that Hinkley played \"an important part in ensuring our future low-carbon energy security\". Mr Ayrault said he was pleased that the UK government had decided to go ahead with the project. Q&A: What is Hinkley Point and why is it important? How much would Hinkley C cost bill payers? What does China get out of Hinkley? Dozens of contracts running to thousands of pages for the huge project in Somerset are believed to have been prepared ahead of the event. The key document is the Contract for Difference, or CfD, which gives a guaranteed price for the electricity Hinkley will generate for 35 years. In return EDF, along with CGN, will finance the project and shoulder the risk of any delays. Critics say the guaranteed \"strike price\" - which is more than twice the current wholesale cost of electricity - will provide a windfall for EDF for decades to come. The formal go-ahead for Hinkley also cements China's foothold in Britain's nuclear industry. The last government signed a series of co-operation agreements in civil nuclear power with Beijing which opened the UK's market to Chinese firms.

It is thought Lossiemouth could lose its Tornado fleet to RAF Marham. Michael Moore, speaking in the Commons, promised help would be provided to the local area but insisted no final decision had been made. Later, during Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron denied accusations of concentrating defence spending in the south of England. Meanwhile, First Minister Alex Salmond has written to Defence Secretary Liam Fox setting out concerns about the RAF bases in Moray. Mr Salmond said: \"I fully appreciate that tough decisions must be made in times of financial constraints. \"However these sorts of decisions must also be fair, balanced and responsive to wider long-term social and economic impacts, particularly where these cannot be absorbed easily within local communities.\" It is feared the base's Tornado fleet could be transferred to RAF Marham in Norfolk, where engineering work for the aircraft is already based. It has been suggested RAF Kinloss could be retained as a barracks for soldiers returning from Germany. Defence sources have already said the troops would not arrive until about 2015 at the earliest. Moray's two RAF bases contribute more than \u00a3150m to the local economy annually and support about 5,700 jobs, a report said earlier this year.\n\nSummary:","375":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

One story had received almost 300 comments of a \"sexist tone\", it said. Abusive comments aimed at players have plagued the sport for months. Women began playing Australian rules football professionally in 2017. Last year Prime Minister Scott Morrison referred to online trolls who attacked star footballer Tayla Harris as \"cowardly grubs\". On Thursday, an article in the Herald Sun explained why comments had been removed from articles about women's Australian rules football (AFLW). Herald Sun head of sport Matt Kitchin said: \"The least offensive of the comments runs to the tune of 'get back in the kitchen' and the worst cannot be repeated they are so objectionable. \"Players, commentators, fans and clubs have all appealed to the Herald Sun to shut off the comments. And we've heard them.\" The move comes two weeks after Harris, a football player for Carlton, offered to give up her wage in order for the AFL to employ someone to monitor online bullying. \"God damn I'll give up my AFLW wage to employ someone to monitor this, public bullying is a ripple effect to young people in schools and communities that lead to mental health issues and suicide,\" she wrote on Twitter. She called on the sports governing body the AFL to \"be a leader in this space\". \"Ignoring these comments is not a solution. Fight back,\" she urged. Last year Harris was targeted with derogatory comments underneath a picture of her playing for the Carlton Blues posted on social media.

And with ballot papers going out in the next few days, this enormous decision could be settled very soon indeed. In the baking sunshine of a pub garden in Kent this afternoon, we spent time with a group of activists, some of those who'll make that huge decision on all our behalf. 'He's my man' It won't surprise you to read that among the group, Mr Johnson was the clear favourite. And several of the group talked about him in the way fans talk about some kind of rock god - \"he electrifies the room\", \"there are spontaneous cheers\", wherever he goes, \"he connects - he's my man,\" said Jackie Perkins. Another talked about queuing up for three hours to listen to him speak at party conferences, expressing disbelief that there seemed even to be a question about who gets the big prize. And his backers dismissed doubts about his character, suggesting there was a \"bash Boris\" campaign, that his opponents love \"jumping on bandwagons\" or, in remarks that the Johnson camp would probably love, the flaws that he might have in his character are the kind that that Winston Churchill might have had in 1939. This completely unscientific, of course, sample of Tories stacked up with the widely held view inside the party that the membership tilts clearly to backing the former foreign secretary, whatever the controversy, whatever the doubts.

It has pledged to bring forward legislation later in the year. The move comes after the vast majority of people who responded to a consultation backed the measure. Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon said more than 80% of slaughterhouses in Scotland had already installed CCTV cameras voluntarily. But she said the standards of CCTV coverage could vary, and added that the new rules were needed to \"improve further the already high standards being followed by the livestock sector in Scotland.\" She formally unveiled her plans in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon. 'Open and transparent' Animal rights groups have claimed that the abuse of animals is widespread in slaughterhouses, and believe independently-monitored CCTV cameras will help to limit their suffering. The Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers welcomed the Scottish government announcement, but said more than 95% of animals slaughtered in Scotland go through abattoirs that already use CCTV systems. It also insisted the industry had an \"open and transparent approach\" with the veterinary authorities and follows the strict welfare controls which are monitored by Food Standards Scotland. A spokesman for the association said some existing CCTV systems may need to be upgraded or completely replaced under the proposals, and called for assurances that the industry will be given help to meet any additional costs as has already happened in Wales.\n\nSummary:","378":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The pledge from a nation of 1.3 billion people is the most ambitious of the global plans against plastic pollution. The UN report also reveals that the Galapagos will ban single-use plastics, Sri Lanka will ban styrofoam and China is insisting on biodegradable bags. But the authors warn that far more needs to be done to reduce the vast flow of plastic into rivers and oceans. Action against plastic waste has many drivers across the world. In the UK it has been stimulated by media coverage. In many developing countries, plastic bags are causing floods by blocking drains, or they\u2019re being eaten by cattle. The report says policies to combat plastic waste have had mixed results. In Cameroon, plastic bags are banned and households are paid for every kilo of plastic waste they collect, but still plastic bags are being smuggled in. In several countries, rules on plastic exist but are poorly enforced. The report presents an A-Z of 35 potential bio substitutes for plastic. It runs from Abaca hemp (from the inedible banana Musa textilis) to Zein (from a maize protein). The list includes rabbit fur, sea grass and foam made with fungus. It mentions QMilch, a firm that create casein textile fibres from waste milk. It also highlights Pi\u00f1atex, a plastic alternative made from pineapple leaves. Some policy-makers, though, are wary about hyping the potential of bio alternatives. Early optimism by some environmentalists about biofuels backfired when rainforests were felled to grow palm oil to fuel cars.

The borough council, which led the project, called the reopening a \"major milestone\" for the park. Business leaders hope the Grade II-listed attraction will \"give new life\" to the seafront. The Venetian Waterways were opened in 1928, having been commissioned by the borough council as a way to create work after World War One. Restoration began in June and has been supported by 78 volunteers from the Green Gym, who have contributed nearly 1,300 hours of work. The island cafe and pergolas have been renovated, and the original planting - celebrated at the 1928 RHS International Exhibition of Gardening Design - has also been revived. Work is continuing on the neighbouring boating lake and will be finished by summer.

Priority is being given to at-risk and younger children, with P4-7 pupils facing the most disruption. A UK-wide shortage of the nasal spray Fluenz Tetra has meant health boards are receiving fewer vaccines than needed. How many children have been affected? Programmes started in Scotland in October to vaccinate against flu, which typically circulates in December, January and February. All Scottish primary schoolchildren are currently entitled to the vaccine, however some will see it pushed back. It is difficult to tell how many children have been affected, but 12 out of 14 health boards in Scotland have reported delays so far. The health boards are following advice from the Scottish government to prioritise younger children aged two to five as well as five to 18-year-olds who have underlying health conditions. NHS Grampian estimated 163 schools had been affected by the delays, meaning approximately 27,000 pupils in the region could face disruption. NHS Lothian, NHS Dumfries & Galloway and NHS Shetland all confirmed they had faced some disruption to their flu programmes. NHS Highland said deliveries UK-wide were between two and four weeks behind schedule, meaning primary school vaccination sessions due to start on 11 and 18 November had been postponed. Pupils in P3-7 from 28 schools in the NHS Borders region will also face similar delays of about two to four weeks, according to the health board. NHS Fife and NHS Forth Valley both said the schedule for children in P4-7 had been delayed due to the shortages. Some vaccine sessions at primary schools in Ayrshire and Arran due to begin on 18 November will be postponed, according to the health board.

It is thought that around 4,860 homes in England will experience extra noise as a result of the proposed train line, according to a study by the Department for Transport. An estimated 10 properties will suffer from high noise levels and another 150 will need noise insulation. So just how loud will the proposed trains be? The government is yet to indicate the volume level, but according to the Telegraph, the Department for Transport has hired engineering firm Arup to demonstrate the noise to concerned members of the public. A simulation of the train's noise when it passes through various points can be heard through headphones at a series of roadshows. The simulated sound has been created by using a recording of the 217mph high-speed trains in France and then adjusting the sound to take into account Britain's potentially even faster trains. The government believes 250mph trains could be available by 2020. The recording is tweaked to take into account the ambient sounds from various locations along the route. Despite an absence of official numbers, the chairwoman of the Stop HS2 group, Lizzy Williams, estimates at 50m from the track, the noise from the trains will be \"between 95 and 97 decibels every two minutes if the line runs at capacity\". But speed isn't the only determinant of train noise. How bothersome the noise is depends on the pitch and the quality of the sound, says Royal Academy of Engineering network rail research professor Roderick Smith. \"A freight train on a poorly maintained track will create a lot more noise for a longer time,\" he explains.

Jason Furman, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to President Obama, spoke to the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. He said President Trump had a tough job on his hands. \"Reform has winners and losers, and often the losers feel the pain in a very specific concentred way, the winners are more diffuse and that makes it easier for the losers to organise,\" Prof Furman said. \"[Also] I think there are some benefits to tax reform but I don't think they are so huge that it absolutely has to happen.\" Loopholes President Trump made tax \"reform\" a cornerstone of his economic policy during his election campaign, and has continued to stress its importance amid the administrative chaos and apparent policy failures of his presidency so far. The idea of changing the complicated US taxation system, for both companies and people, has been bandied about for many years. But the last substantial change was 30 years ago, indicating, according to Prof Furman, how hard it was to achieve. And he pointed out that in fact there are two broad conceptions of what \"reform\" actually means, and that it was still not clear to which one the president was referring. \"The president has been on both sides of that issue so it's a bit unclear exactly what his motivation is,\" said Prof Furman, who is now Professor of Economic Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. He said the first conception involved taking away a lot of loopholes and a lot of inefficient parts of the US tax code and lowering the overall tax rate. That would benefit the United States, especially US companies, which currently have to pay a corporate tax rate of 35%. \"Much higher than in the UK, or almost any other country in the world,\" the professor said. The second idea of tax cuts, he explained, involved believing in shrinking the size of the government and changing the distribution\n\nSummary:","392":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The officers involved in the beating were acquitted the following year, sparking clashes in which 50 died. King was found dead at the bottom of a swimming pool last month at the age of 47. There was no sign of foul play. 'Symbol of forgiveness' The funeral service was held at Los Angeles' Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills on Saturday. \"People should not be judged by the mistakes that they make, but by how they rise above them,\" Rev Al Sharpton said. \"Rodney had risen above his mistakes. He never mocked anyone - not the police, not the justice system, not anyone.\" Mr King's famous words during the riots \"Can we all get along?\" were embroidered on the lid of the coffin, next to his portrait. \"He became a symbol of forgiveness,\" Rev Sharpton said. A number of donors helped to pay for the funeral. LAPD racism Rodney King's beating at the hands of the police, which left him with brain damage, was filmed by a bystander and shown by media outlets across the world. He had been stopped for speeding on a dark street on 3 March 1991. The four LA police officers who pulled him over hit him more than 50 times with their batons, kicked him and shot him with stun guns. The iconic images of his beating had a huge impact at the time on an already tense Los Angeles. Eventually, the whole chain of events had a profound impact on the way race was dealt with in the US. King recently told the Los Angeles Times that while he had come to terms with his broader legacy, dealing with the past had not been easy. \"Some people feel like I'm some kind of hero,\" he said. \"Others hate me. They say I deserved it. Other people, I can hear them mocking me for when I called for an end to the destruction, like I'm a fool for believing in peace.\" A later trial resulted in two of the four officers being jailed.

It found that levels of MDMA, the active drug in ecstasy, varied by more than 250% in the same batch. Scientists also found a huge difference in how long it took the tablets to release MDMA into the body. They claim it's the first time ecstasy tablets have been found to disintegrate at different rates. \"Fast releasing\" tablets released 95% of their MDMA within 30 minutes, according to the study, with slower ones taking 100 minutes - which they warn increases the likelihood of someone taking a second dose before the effects of the first are fully experienced. Drug analyst Trevor Shine says his team were \"surprised\" at the \"huge\" difference in MDMA levels between pills, as well as the difference in disintegration rates. He says this study shows that MDMA affects people differently, and that it's impossible to predict what varying amounts will do. The team say the \"vast majority of people using MDMA do not come to harm, but there is at present no way to predict, determine or prevent who will.\" \"I suspect many\/most users will still view it as something that happens to others, not them,\" Trevor tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Experts say there's been a \"resurgence in use of MDMA in Europe\" as well as an increase in strength. \"Our research clearly demonstrates that taking MDMA is a far more risky activity than perhaps thought,\" says Dr Lewis Couchman from St George's. \"It is prone to unpredictable dosing with toxic effects and potentially lethal consequences, of which users and drug workers need to be aware and should be warned.\" What happens in your body when you take MDMA? \"When MDMA gets absorbed into your blood stream, it hits your brain and causes it to release a whole bunch of chemicals,\" addiction psychiatrist Dr Adam Winstock, who also runs the Global Drug Survey, previously told Newsbeat. \"Mainly serotonin but also things called noradrenal\n\nSummary:","395":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Doctors at the hospital in Lewisham put him in a medically-induced coma, from which he woke on 13 July.

Earlier he had tweeted pictures of himself with his children - which also showed the dressing on the tracheotomy cut in his throat to help him breathe. Another message showed him holding his wife's hands and saying \"Every facet of my life would be worse without Rebecca in it. How will I ever thank her? \"I was in a coma for nine or ten nights (I just learned). That's a lot of staring at your husband and his pipes. And a lot of worry.\" When first taken ill he had originally joked on social media he was getting in on the celebrations for the 70th birthday of the NHS. \"I hate to miss a party,\" he posted.

There's an even bigger bonus for people who can harvest 15 tonnes - they'll be allowed to skip the long waiting list for a locally made car, according to the region's website. It says all cotton pickers will be paid in cash, and the prizes are an extra incentive for \"the most hard-working people\". Buying a new car can be a drawn-out process in Uzbekistan, with waiting lists of up to six months and deposits as high as 85% for some Chevrolet models, which are made in the country. Second-hand cars can be bought more easily at markets, but many people prefer a new set of wheels. While Sirdaryo is dangling a carrot, Uzbekistan's interim President Shavkat Mirziyoyev seems to have opted for the stick. According to US-backed Radio Ozodlik, he's threatened to jail farmers who don't meet their cotton-picking targets. Uzbekistan's annual cotton harvest is not only carried out by agricultural labourers - public sectors workers including teachers and medical professionals are all expected to join in.

In response, Turkish PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan said similar protests in Europe would be dealt with more harshly. Turkey has seen a week of civil unrest sparked by a police crackdown on a local protest over an Istanbul park. Fresh clashes between protesters and police broke out in the Istanbul suburb of Gazi on Friday evening, Reuters reported. Demonstrators hurled stones at police who responded with smoke grenades. Hundreds of anti-government protesters are still camped in Istanbul's Taksim Square and correspondents say further demonstrations are expected over the weekend. Mr Fuele and Mr Erdogan were both speaking at a conference in Istanbul on Turkey's relations with the EU. The EU enlargement commissioner said the EU had no intention of giving up on Turkey's accession, but Turkey had to maintain values of freedom and fundamental rights. He urged a \"swift and transparent\" investigation and those responsible should be held to account. \"Peaceful demonstrations constitute a legitimate way for groups to express their views in a democratic society,\" he said. \"Excessive use of force by police against these demonstrations has no place in such a democracy\". Defiant In response, Mr Erdogan accused the EU of double standards, saying police in Europe and the US used the similar methods. \"Similar protests have taken place in Britain, France, Germany and bigger ones in Greece,\" he said. His government was open to \"democratic demands\", he added, but would not accept \"terrorism, violence and vandalism\". The Turkish leader also complained about the slow pace of the EU accession process, saying Turkey faced \"unjust obstructions\".

Announcing Smith's time off, the show's producers said in a statement: \"The entire team at Funny Girl is thinking of Sheridan, and know she is getting the rest and support she needs during this very difficult and stressful time. \"We will all miss her enormously and send her our love and best wishes - and we are looking forward to her return to the show in due course. \"Meanwhile, we are thrilled to support the wonderful Natasha J Barnes who will be taking on the role of Fanny Brice until Sheridan's return.\" The statement also said Barnes has received \"high praise from audiences on the occasions that she has appeared\". On Wednesday, Barnes thanked the show's audiences via her Twitter account. Smith, who has received rave reviews for her performances in the show, has previously written on Twitter that she was \"not strong enough\" and apologised to audiences for the shows she had already missed.

And then his testimony to Congress in February offered further clues. Here are five potential lines of inquiry Mr Mueller could be pursuing and why. Trump tower meeting It's been more than 16 months since the first public disclosure of the 9 June, 2016, Trump Tower meeting between a Russian team lead by lawyer Natalya Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr, Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner - three of the top members of the Trump campaign. The meeting has continued to loom in the background as either a smoking gun of collusion in plain view or campaign business as usual, depending on who's doing the talking. Although Mr Mueller reportedly learned about the meeting at the same time as the rest of America, it's now clearly a point of interest in the special counsel's larger investigation into possible co-operation or co-ordination between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. According to multiple media outlets, the special counsel's office asked the president about whether he had advance knowledge of the meeting in written questions that Mr Trump answered last week. The president supposedly denied - as he has in public - any prior knowledge of the Trump tower get-together, which was presented to his son as both part of an effort by the Russian government to help the Trump campaign and an opportunity to gain \"incriminating information\" about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. If the Trump Tower meeting is evidence of the Trump campaign team's interest in gaining information from Russia, the big question becomes what - if anything - happened next. Ms Veselnitskaya is reported to have ties to senior members of the Russian government.

The papers show how accountancy firms mapped out strategies to minimise or avoid every significant tax. Blackstone said its investments were \"wholly compliant with UK tax laws\". Paradise Papers - Tax secrets of the ultra-rich Property deals Blackstone is one of the world's biggest private equity groups and its founder and chief executive Stephen Schwarzman is a close confidant of President Trump. Leaked documents from the offshore law firm Appleby, seen by BBC Scotland, show for the first time how the group structured two major UK property deals. Top accountancy firms issued long documents to Blackstone outlining how it could use trusts in the tax haven of Jersey and a complex structure of companies in Luxembourg for the purchase of both Chiswick Park and the St Enoch Centre. There is no suggestion that the plans were illegal but campaigners the Tax Justice Network described the structures Blackstone used as an \"economic fiction\". They told the BBC it was clear from the data in the papers that the principal purpose of the structures, which are virtually identical, was to avoid tax. 'Losing revenue' US tax expert Reuven Avi-Yonah, from the University of Michigan law school, said the documents gave a \"rare\" insight into company structures that even tax authorities did not often see. \"If HMRC becomes aware of the fact that this is a common type of structuring then they are more likely to challenge it because they will be aware they are losing a lot of revenue,\" he said.

It is unsurprising, therefore, that many people are fearful of going out, returning life to normal or even letting children go back to school. People want to be safe. But the problem is we are no longer as safe as we once were. There is, after all, a new virus around that can have catastrophic consequences. The need to balance competing risks So what should we do? Some have argued restrictions need to continue until safety can be guaranteed. But those arguments generally ignore the fact that continuing to do so carries risk in itself. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty often describes these as the \"indirect costs\" of the pandemic. They include everything from poor access to healthcare for other conditions through to rises in mental illness, financial hardship and damage to education. So as restrictions ease, society and individuals themselves are going to have to make decisions based on balancing competing sets of risks. Why you should not expect to be 100% safe Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at Edinburgh University, says the question we should be asking is whether we are \"safe enough\". \"There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community it's about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling.\" She was referring to the row over schools, but the concept can equally be applied to many other scenarios.

He added that passengers he had spoken to at Waterloo had been \"pleasantly surprised\" by their morning commute. Stations elsewhere on the network were also quieter than normal. Winchester station was described as a \"ghost town\" while passengers at Esher station, who had been told to expect lengthy queues, instead found empty platforms. About 1,000 workers are taking part in the upgrade work. When the works began on Saturday, services were also hit by a signal failure. Network Rail CEO Mark Carne apologised for the disruption to trains but said there was \"no other way to do this\". \"There will be three weeks of disruption but decades of fantastically improved services,\" he said.

West Yorkshire Police said people had waded across a section of river to gain access to the reserve, sparking concerns for their safety. A local community group said they also disturbed nesting birds and could have trodden on some of the young birds. Supt Chris Bowen said the force wanted to encourage people to play by the rules, but would use enforcement powers where necessary. \"We would urge people to consider their own safety and the safety of others, particularly during the warmer weather and the ongoing period of lockdown,\" he said. Sound equipment was also seized by officers. The reserve is a protected area and is used as a nesting ground for several species of birds. Posting on Facebook, the Kirkstall Valley community group, which campaigns against fly-tipping and anti-social behaviour, said it was appalled. The group said the revellers would have scared off many waterfowl species, leading to their young being abandoned. Follow BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

What makes his performance all the more remarkable is that he hardly utters a word. The film's only real spoken lines come in a voiceover at the start when Redford's character - known only as Our Man - reads out a valedictory letter to his family and friends. After that he faces high seas and violent storms with an almost silent stoicism. \"If you'd cast Jack Nicholson in the role it would have been a different movie and I'd have rewritten it with a running commentary,\" explains director and writer JC Chandor. \"But Redford has an... innate ability to communicate complex emotional transitions non-verbally.\" Chandor made his name with 2011's talky financial crisis drama Margin Call, a debut feature that earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. All is Lost couldn't be more different. Chandor's screenplay was 31 pages of prose description, with no dialogue. A typical film script might have 120 pages. Chandor was inspired to write the film's opening letter on a train journey along the US coast, while he was hard at work editing Margin Call. \"I was taking train rides up and down the eastern seaboard where I could see these middle-class towns where everyone has boats. I wrote this longing, sad letter on one of those train rides.\" Chandor had the idea of casting Redford for All is Lost while at Redford's annual Sundance Film Festival in Utah. During Redford's welcoming speech, a technical hitch meant that a speaker close to Chandor stopped working and robbed the actor of his voice. \"I was struck by the contrast,\" says Chandor. \"Here was this guy across the room I could barely hear. A month later, I couldn't get it out of my head. I offered him the role and expected not to hear anything.\" Five days later Chandor was summoned to meet Redford in Los Angeles.

Accounts of his behaviour were recorded in the clerk's appraisals but no one in the Commons intervened to protect her. Mr Vaz denies breaching any of the rules of the House and denies bullying. Jenny McCullough served as a clerk in the House of Commons from 2002 to 2011. She has claimed Mr Vaz repeatedly bullied and undermined her position in the House while he was chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee.

They said that the Leicester East MP was prone to bullying clerks, particularly those who tried to stand up for the standards of the House. Ms McCullough alleges that Mr Vaz said she was a poor clerk because she was \"not a mother\". He also made jokes about whether Ms McCullough was a security threat, on account of her Northern Irish background and accent. Mr Vaz was chairman of the home affairs committee from 2007 until his resignation in 2016 - the Sunday Mirror reported he was caught hiring prostitutes and showing willing to pay for drugs. An inquiry into that is ongoing. Ms McCullough's relationship with Mr Vaz deteriorated rapidly on an official committee trip to Russia and Ukraine in 2008, when Ms McCullough raised concerns with Mr Vaz about his compliance with the rules and protocols of the House.

They found that the average risk was 18%, not 3-10% as estimated before. An autism charity says genetics only play a part in the disorder. Autism is a complex disorder which affects a child's ability to think, communicate, interact and learn. The study involved infants from 20 different places across the US and Canada, who were six to eight months old at the start of the research. They all had older siblings with autism. The researchers, from the Mind Institute in California, followed the children's development up to the age of three years, when they tested for autism. Of the 664 participants, a total of 132 children were found to meet the criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder. Of these, 54 received a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 78 were considered to have a milder form of autism. All the children were tested using an autism diagnostic tool, which measures non-verbal cognitive, language and motor skills. Among the study participants, 26.2% of male infants compared to 9% of female infants were diagnosed with a form of autism. Previous studies have shown that autism is more common in males than females - 80% of all affected children are male. In families with more than one older sibling with autism in the study, the average risk was 32%. Unknown factors Prof Sally Ozonoff, lead study author and professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Mind Institute, University of California, explained the higher average risk figures in her study. \"Previous studies used different diagnostic criteria. This is the largest study of the siblings of children with autism ever conducted, the first to follow families up to the time of diagnosis as opposed to looking back once they have been diagnosed.\" But she was careful to emphasis that the figures were estimates averaged across all of the families. \"So for some families the risk will be greater th\n\nSummary:","416":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Conservative-run council wants to sell the \u00a32m statue citing high insurance and security costs. Asked for a response, the council will only say it \"is in discussion about the statue's sale\". The opposition Liberal Democrat group said the council had failed to keep it up to date on the sale. Group leader Brendan Glynane said he would ask what the council meant by \"discussions\" and would seek more clarity on the sale at the next council meeting. 'No right to sell' The ruling party had earlier said it could not comment during talks with the legal advisers of the present Marquis of Northampton, but \"will issue updates when appropriate\". The sale has been challenged by Lord Northampton, who said the council did not have the right to sell the statue under the original deed of gift. The 30in (76cm) limestone figure clutching beer, bread and cake - items for the afterlife - is believed to have been acquired by Spencer Compton, the second Marquis of Northampton during a trip to Egypt in 1850. It was presented to the museum by his son.

Thousands of homes have collapsed, along with hospitals, hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way, though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide, and a key bridge is out of action. 'Many bodies along the shoreline' Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed, but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured, and 29 are listed as missing. \"Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami, but the numbers are still unknown,\" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told Reuters. \"When the threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,\" he told a news briefing. \"The tsunami didn't come by itself - it dragged cars, logs, houses - it hit everything on land.\" Some survived by climbing 6m (18ft) trees to escape the huge waves, the spokesman said. A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu, hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake, and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600,000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies.

While some candidates are keener to push local issues, others are more willing to talk about Brexit. The election was triggered by the death of veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn, who served the constituency since 1987. Labour will be hoping to hold on to the seat, but the Tories have had a sizeable vote in the seat in recent years. Mr Flynn had a majority of 3,510 in 2015, which rose to 5,658 in 2017. It is a crowded field and the ballot paper will feature 11 candidates - including much smaller parties looking to make an impact. A major topic has been whether the M4 relief road should be built. That is despite the fact the issue is not being dealt with by the Parliament the winner would be elected to, but is devolved to Cardiff Bay's National Assembly. Candidates were interviewed by BBC Wales during the week of the second attempt to pass the Brexit deal through the Commons, in March. Ruth Jones is standing for the Labour party. The candidate grew-up in the Newport West estate of the Gaer. She is a trained physiotherapist who became a full-time trade union official in 2016. Ms Jones said voters wanted to send a message that \"austerity was not working\". \"There is a danger that the national papers and the media will see it as a Brexit by-election, but the people of Newport West will be looking to replace their much-loved MP,\" she said. \"We can't accept a damaging Tory Brexit or a no-deal outcome\" she argued, adding: \"I would support preparing for a public vote just in case Parliament isn't able to achieve a sensible Brexit. Issues raised on the doorstep, she said, included levels of crime and the M4 relief road, which she has backed. \"Whatever is going on in Parliament at the moment, people in Newport West want to make sure they are safe, and their jobs are safe\", she added.

Mr Nolan has taken on the role of interim head teacher, together with Jackie Powell. The report said: \"Teaching is inadequate.

But that was better than the previous month's reading of 51.1, which had marked a 16-month low. The eurozone economy has seen 18 months of continuous, albeit weak growth. Markit said its latest PMI survey, which combines the results of individual surveys of the construction, services and manufacturing industries, suggested the eurozone economy grew by just 0.1% in the last three months of 2014. Persistently low inflation since the start of last year has led consumers and business to hold off making purchases or making investments in the expectation that prices will continue to fall. The problem has been exacerbated since the summer by the falling price of oil. Brent crude has fallen by more than 50% since August to $51.54 per barrel. The fear of deflation led the European Central Bank (ECB) to lower interest rates to 0.05% and begin an asset purchase programme to inject cash into the economy in August. However, the ECB has resisted taking the same action as central banks in the US, UK and Japan by buying government debt. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the weakness of the latest PMI surveys would \"add to calls for more aggressive central bank stimulus, including full-scale quantitative easing, to be undertaken as soon as possible\".

Following outrage against his \"vulgar\" comments about the temple, which features erotic sculptures, he quickly clarified that the tweet was a joke, and the sculptures were \"exquisite\". The other tweets appear to be making fun of the people of the state and another of its famous temples. Two locals filed police complaints saying the tweets had hurt the sentiments of the 40 million people who live in Orissa, which is known for its historic temples, sun-washed beaches and delicious cuisine. It's another matter that there has been no public agitation against Mr Iyer-Mitra for his comments and that one of his offending tweets got just seven likes and one retweet.

Camacho was being treated at the Rio Piedras medical centre in San Juan.

Flamboyant Camacho was shot in the head on Tuesday while sitting in a car outside a bar in his home city of Bayamon, outside the capital San Juan.

Camacho was known for his flamboyant style and skill in the ring. He was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in New York where he made his professional debut in 1980. He went on to win four world titles across three weight divisions, beginning with the WBC super featherweight title in 1983. His last fight was an attempted comeback against Saul Duran in 2010, which he lost. By then he had become known for his troubled personal life and run-ins with the police. Camacho was sentenced to seven years in prison for burglary in 2007, though the sentence was later suspended. He was found in possession of drugs and was the subject of a restraining order brought by his ex-wife, who complained of domestic abuse. At the time of his death he held a career record of 79 wins, 6 losses and three draws, with 38 knockouts.\n\nSummary:","429":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Not far off the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, and just to the north east of the famous coastal city is the area in question. It is an almost unimaginably large oil deposit; 1,500 sq km (579 sq miles) and 326m (1,070ft) deep. Although it lies well beneath the sea bed, under a thick layer of rock and salt, the find is said to be relatively risk-free. Estimates vary but it could hold as many as 12bn barrels of oil. The find has been called \"Libra\" and Brazil is about to auction off the rights to develop the site, with some pretty tight strings attached. Magda Chambriard is the Director General of Brazil's National Oil Agency. For her it's a win-win situation. We discussed Libra and its implications for Brazil as a global oil producer, in her Rio de Janeiro headquarters. She dismissed, with a wry smile, suggestions the country didn't have the experience or infrastructure to cope with such a huge undertaking as the development of the Libra field. \"Everything is very well planned. There are new platforms, new pipelines, more infrastructure,\" said the woman who trained as an oil engineer but is now one of the most powerful figures in the industry. \"Everything here in Brazil is happening in the correct way so we are very confident that everything will be OK.\" Just to the north of Rio de Janeiro, the once small fishing village of Macae is the closest land point to the offshore fields. It's not quite El Dorado but property prices here are already among the highest in the country and these days the noise of helicopters ferrying workers out to the existing rigs is much louder than the chug of fishing boats around the mangroves.

He feared it could mean a long delay or that Brexit \"may never happen at all\" and said the UK must be prepared to walk away without a deal. The PM said she was focused on leaving the EU with a deal on 29 March. Mr Eustice is a longstanding Brexiteer, who stood as a UKIP MEP candidate before joining the Conservatives. He told the BBC he would back the withdrawal deal the prime minister has negotiated with the EU, despite some reservations. \"I do think it's preferable to have an orderly Brexit and crucially, it's preferable to get Brexit done,\" he said. \"We have to get legally out of the European Union as quickly as possible within this window. If we don't and we end up with a long delay of two years, as some would like, then I really do fear we will be in a disastrous situation and Brexit may never happen at all.\" Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who himself quit the government in November, suggested any delay to Brexit would reward the EU for its \"intransigence\" and reduce the chances of getting a deal. \"The issue with delay is at this point in time it weakens our leverage - why would the EU make concessions now?\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. \"I think from the EU's point of view it signals to them that actually their intransigence pays off and that's the wrong message for the UK to be sending to Brussels at this moment.\" Mr Eustice, the MP for Camborne and Redruth in Cornwall, is the 14th member of Theresa May's government to resign over Brexit and said he was doing so with \"tremendous sadness\".

Her son, Graham, was worried what the two doses would do, but said his mother seemed \"her normal self\". A governing body member for NHS Kernow in Cornwall said: \"We apologise to the family that this incident has occurred.\" Mr Wright contacted the emergency services after his elderly mother, 89, had received the vaccine at her home on both 21 and 23 January. \"They'd [a paramedic] never heard of anybody having two Covid vaccines within such a short period and they didn't really know what to do,\" he told the BBC. He has shared the story as he does \"not want this to happen to anybody else\". Rob White, NHS Kernow's clinical lead for the Covid-19 vaccination programme, said receiving two doses in a short space of time \"will not cause the patient any harm\" and they were investigating what had happened. The UK's chief medical officer has said the second dose of the coronavirus vaccine will be given up to 12 weeks after the first dose. Two doses are needed to offer the best protection against the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab \"is much more preferable\" as it provides the \"great majority\" of initial protection. Mr Wright said a nurse and a doctor from the same practice had both injected his mother. A doctor from the practice apologised to him and blamed the mistake on a \"computer glitch\", he explained.

The action has been coordinated by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (Ifpi), which represents record labels worldwide. VK has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. The labels have accused VK, the second biggest social network in Europe, of creating a \"huge library\" of music it does not have the rights for and offering it as a service within its site. The labels are seeking a court order in Russia to make VK to remove a number of files from its service. In a statement announcing the action, Ifpi chief executive Frances Moore said:\"We have repeatedly highlighted this problem over a long period of time. \"We have encouraged VK to cease its infringements and negotiate with record companies to become a licensed service. \"To date the company has taken no meaningful steps to tackle the problem, so today legal proceedings are being commenced.\" 'Notorious' The labels argue that the popularity of VK, and the existence of the music library, make it difficult to set up a legal service in Russia. \"This is an action which can benefit the whole music industry in Russia,\" said Leonid Agronov, chief executive of the National Federation of the Music Industry, a Russian trade body for the recording industry.

Agents said people were compromising on where they live to make ends meet. The government said it was increasing spending on affordable housing. Data from 20 areas of England and Wales relating to two-bedroom houses and flats advertised on OpenRent, and shared with BBC News, reveals: Types of property for rent also vary in size. The average London one-bed flat for rent measures 51 sq m, according to the data. By contrast, in rural Shropshire and mid Wales, the average is 77 sq m. The amount of space you get for your rent is reflected in the space you get for your money when buying. The Office for National Statistics said 1 sq m of floor space - about the size of a red phone box - costs \u00a319,439 in Kensington and Chelsea, while in Blaenau Gwent the same amount of space costs \u00a3777. 'A room with a sink and a microwave' For Ed Stennett \u00a31,000 a month, almost twice the national average rent, should have been plenty. Yet when the app designer moved to central London from Winchester he struggled to find anywhere bigger than a one-room flat for his money. \"Winchester is an expensive place, but even there your money goes further,\" he said. \"When I was looking in London, \u00a31,000 would get me a studio. \"For some of those it was little more than a room with a sink, a kettle and a microwave. \"Some of the nicer ones might have had space for a double bed, but nothing you'd call a living space.

Nor did he walk, preferring to scamper on all fours, picking the pockets of courtiers and stealing kisses. Peter had been found living alone and naked in a German forest in 1725, presumably abandoned by parents who struggled to cope. The following year - aged about 12 - he was brought to London by George I where he became a \"human pet\" at Kensington Palace. There was much fanciful speculation that he had been raised by wolves - or perhaps bears - and this was why he ate with his hands, disliked wearing clothes and could not be taught to speak, says Lucy Worsley, curator of Historic Royal Palaces. \"At the time, people assumed Peter acted the way he did because he was a wild child. They didn't suspect that something else could have been afflicting him.\" She initially assumed autism, but found more clues in this portrait of Peter, by court painter William Kent, that hangs in Kensington Palace. New analysis of this portrait suggests Peter had a rare genetic condition known as Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome, indicated by: At Worsley's request, Professor Phillip Beales, of the Institute of Child Health, plugged these characteristics into his database of conditions caused by chromosome abnormalities. The closest match is Pitt-Hopkins, a genetic condition only identified in 1978, which has severe neurological effects, says Professor Beales. \"It's severe learning difficulties, developmental difficulties and the inability to develop speech.\" Contemporary accounts chime with his diagnosis, such as this description of Peter's first appearance at court: \"The wild boy played with a glove of Caroline's [the Princess of Wales], grew fascinated by a pocket watch that struck the hours and, as was usual with him, attempted some mild pickpocketing.

With lockdown in England having come to an end, gyms and swimming pools across the country are allowed to reopen from Wednesday, regardless of what tier their area is in. \"While it's extremely positive that millions of swimmers up and down the country can return to the activity they love, it's unacceptable to even think that so many people or clubs will not have a much-loved swimming pool to visit,\" Swim England's chief executive Jane Nickerson said. She said more investment was needed to keep swimming pools and leisure centres open, adding despite a government grant for the industry \"financial pressures have not gone away\". Four times world champion triathlete Barbara Holmes, from Lancashire, said: \"People need their pools, especially the children.\" Ms Holmes, who is the over-60s world champion, has been backing campaigners trying to reopen Fleetwood swimming pool. \"The community needs to be heard,\" she said.

Over the last five years, his sight has deteriorated severely. He now has just 10% vision in his left eye and is registered blind.

He works with the NHS in all four nations of the UK on issues around eye health and fits in training around his job, which involves frequent travel.

The Fulton County Medical Examiner's office in Atlanta released an initial statement ahead of the full post-mortem report - eight months after her death. A judge in Atlanta issued an order on Thursday to unseal the report, following requests from the media. The medical examiner's office said it reviewed medical records, investigative files and other documents to determine how Brown died. The exam concluded cannabis and alcohol were involved in her death, along with medication used for sedation or to treat anxiety, citing the \"underlying cause\" of death as \"immersion associated with drug intoxication\". The statement said: \"Death was clearly not due to natural causes, but the medical examiner has not been able to determine whether death was due to intentional or accidental causes, and has therefore classified the manner of death as undetermined.'' The state reportedly requested the post-mortem documents originally be sealed in September 2015 in order to protect an ongoing investigation into Brown's death. Media lawyers argued the sealing order should be lifted because it was made without a public hearing, in violation of the long-standing rules that post-mortem results are public records. \"We would hope that news agencies and the media receiving the report would do so with the discretion and dignity a family who has lost a loved one deserves,\" said district attorney Paul Howard, who argued for the sealing of the report last year. \"Our investigation into the death of Bobbi Kristina Brown will continue.\" Brown was the only child of singer Whitney Houston; her father was R&B singer Bobby Brown.

Officials said there could be a link to a similar incident in Roraima state. There, 10 inmates died in clashes on Sunday between a gang calling itself First Command of the Capital, or PCC, and their rivals, Comando Vermelho (Red Command), the state authorities said. Police initially said 25 inmates had been killed, but the figure was later revised down. The incident in Roraima happened during visiting hours. About 100 visitors were taken hostage and later freed. Police said they had regained control of both jails. Brazil has the world's fourth largest prison population, with more than 620,000 inmates. The PCC is a powerful criminal gang first established in a Sao Paulo prison in 1993.

Hundreds of people marched through Tokyo, waving banners to celebrate what they hope will be the end of nuclear power in Japan. Power shortages Since the Fukushima disaster, all the country's reactors have been shut down for routine maintenance. They must withstand tests against earthquakes and tsunamis, and local authorities must give their consent in order for plants to restart. So far, none have.

However, regional authorities would still have to give their approval. Ministers have warned Japan faces a summer of power shortages. The BBC's Roland Buerk, in Tokyo, says the government could force the issue, but so far has been reluctant to move against public opinion. Organisers of the anti-nuclear march in the capital estimated turnout at 5,500. Demonstrators carried banners shaped as giant fish.

About 40% of carers are thought to be at risk of depression or stress because of their caring role. Charity Carers UK said GPs had a vital role to play in supporting carers. It is estimated that seven million people in the UK currently provide unpaid care to a sick or disabled child or an adult who could not otherwise live independently. Many of them are already known to GPs, but the RCGP says more should be done to improve the support and services offered to carers. It says the \"screening\" process for depression should involve \"a small number of general, non-invasive, questions about mood and mental wellbeing\". The RCGP has also drawn up a list for clinical commissioning groups - groups of GPs that plan local care - of measures to ensure carers' needs are taken into account: Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said carers often found it hard to admit they were struggling. \"Carers often neglect their own healthcare needs and in many cases it is only a matter of time before they themselves become ill. \"GPs can play a crucial role in identifying potential problems in the early stages and 'screening' for depression is something that many GPs are doing already. \"Commissioners need to invest in supporting carers as a critical asset. \"They already save the public purse \u00a3119bn a year and this initiative could save even more by ensuring that carers stay well enough to keep on caring.\" Fear and anxiety Eileen Skidmore, from Birmingham, has been caring for her mother for more than 20 years.

By the time he made his first film appearance five years later, he had established himself as a leading Shakespearean actor thanks to his work at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario. In 1964, Plummer played the title role in a production of William Shakespeare's Hamlet that was filmed at Elsinore Castle in Denmark, the setting for much of the play's action. Sir Michael Caine, who played Horatio in the televised production, recalled in his autobiography how Plummer had to race through his soliloquies lest they be interrupted by a persistent nearby foghorn. The 1965 film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical The Sound of Music remains Plummer's best-known and best-loved film. Set in Austria in the late 1930s, it saw him play a widowed former naval officer who falls in love with the guardian who comes to look after his seven children. In 1975's The Return of the Pink Panther, Plummer played Sir Charles Litton, an urbane aristocrat suspected of being a jewel thief, opposite Peter Sellers' bumbling Inspector Clouseau. Catherine Schell played his wife in the film, which Blake Edwards - the husband of Plummer's Sound of Music co-star Julie Andrews - co-wrote and directed. Plummer did his own sleuthing in 1979's Murder By Decree, which saw him play Sherlock Holmes opposite James Mason's Doctor Watson. The film saw the fictional detective investigate the real-life murders perpetrated by the notorious killer nicknamed Jack the Ripper. In 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, Plummer donned an eye patch and extensive make-up to play the sinister Klingon general Chang. The film took its subtitle from Hamlet and saw Plummer's character quote extensively from the Bard's works.

Listed building consent is required from the local authority, before any work is done to the fabric of a listed property. The holes drilled in the wall around the mural could be seen a contravention of the regulations. Gloucestershire Police said its officers were present when council officials went into the house but \"purely from a public safety perspective\" to ensure there was \"no breach of the peace in the area\". Restoration hope After the holes appeared, businessman Hekmat Kaveh - who has offered funds to buy the house to ensure the mural stays in the town - said he thought an attempt was being made to remove it. Since the end of June campaigners have been working to reverse a plan to remove and sell the mural by raising up to \u00a31m to buy the building and the graffiti on it. The GCHQ-themed mural remains covered in silver and red graffiti, after it was vandalised two weeks ago. A professional art conservator has visited the mural and said it could be saved but might take months to restore. \"We've established it's possible to get the [graffiti] tags off safely without unduly affecting the materials underneath,\" said Tom Organ. \"Now we have to also look at the anti-graffiti coating, and assess whether that, in itself, might cause any problems in the long term.\" Mr Organ added it would take \"weeks if not months\" to restore the mural. Campaigners have spent months trying to keep the artwork in situ on the corner of Fairview Road and Hewlett Road, after the owners of the house claimed it had been \n\nSummary:","447":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

An intervention assessment by the Further Education Commissioner (FEC) said \"very swift action\" was needed. The college said a full structural review would take place, but there had already been a \"turnaround\". The FEC intervention was its second in 13 months, prompted by inadequate ratings by Ofsted. Ofsted inspectors visiting last year had said too many of its 5,000 students failed to achieve their qualifications or left their courses early. The FEC then visited in November and said \"expectations of a significant improvement in student outcomes have not materialised\" since its previous visit in July. \"To provide an improved experience for students this year there needs to be very swift action to immediately improve attendance rates, tracking of student progress and, most significantly, the quality of teaching and learning,\" it said. Governors had not held senior leaders to account and achievement rates were still well below the national average, the report states. It added: \"The college and board need to put in place sufficiently skilled and experienced quality improvement personnel... to ensure there is not a further repeat of an inadequate judgement when the college is next inspected.\" The college said a consultation process would take place and a recommendation would then be made by the FEC to the government and to the college board, between Easter and early summer. Principal Jane Townsend added: \"The latest assessment was completed over three months ago, since when we have been very pleased to see a turnaround in a number of areas. \"We are focusing on maintaining this momentum in everything we do.\" Chairman Mark Pendlington said it wanted to make the college \"a regional and national champion for teaching\".\n\nSummary:","448":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Mr Pompeo, who has just returned from Pyongyang, said he had \"good\" talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Mr Kim and President Donald Trump will meet in Singapore on 12 June. The two leaders, who had previously exchanged insults and threats, made the announcement after landmark talks between North and South Korea in April. What did Mr Pompeo say? \"If chairman Kim chooses the right path, there is a future brimming with peace and prosperity for the North Korean people,\" he said after Friday's talks in Washington with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha. Mr Pompeo urged Pyongyang to take \"bold action to quickly denuclearise\". But he stressed that this would require a \"robust verification\" programme by the US and other nations. During his surprise visit to North Korea this week, Pyongyang released three US detainees. How do North and South Korean economies compare? Daily life in the two countries couldn't be more different. After the end of the Korean war in 1953 the South, an ally of the US, embraced a capitalist philosophy. It has developed into one of Asia's most affluent nations. A government-sponsored industrial push in the 1960s led to huge corporations like Samsung and Hyundai being created. Key figures: South Korea is one of the world's top 20 economies, with GDP of $1.4tn (\u00a31tn). By contrast, North Korea's GDP is less than $20bn, placing it well outside the top 100 economies. It has a communist system, but capitalism is creeping into the country. There are things to buy - but only for some people, those who have money.

What has the past year been like for them, caring for people during unprecedented circumstances? 'A steep learning curve' Through all the lockdowns, Food4, run by YMCA Bedfordshire, said the demand for food never ceased. In 2019 it helped 1,915 households, but that number jumped to 9,083 last year. The charity hands out fresh fruit and vegetables, baked goods and larder items donated by supermarkets, which were otherwise destined for landfill. It handled about 16 tonnes of food in 2019, but last year it increased to 112 tonnes. Rebecca Ireland, its business operations manager, said: \"Last year was a steep learning curve for us all; a nearly fivefold increase in our outputs combined with a premises move and all that Covid has brought in terms of staff shielding, isolation and infection control measures. \"But we have had some heart-warming, tear-jerking feedback and thanks from our clients, which has made all our efforts worthwhile.\" She said the food handed out was a \"weight lift\" for families as they were no longer \"going without basic items\". It learned lessons from a busy year and introduced a ticketing system, so timeslots were handed out to avoid long queues. \"We're now in a position to serve the volume of people we're currently seeing, and the team has bonded together really well,\" said Ms Ireland. \"We have formed strong relationships with other food and support charities, from Bedford Foodbank to PBIC, Faces and Age UK Bedfordshire, and with statutory authorities such as the Borough council hub and Public Health, so we are uniquely placed to refer our clients to other support they may need.\" 'Generosity at all-time high' The way charities are \"working together\" has been \"amazing\", said Sarah Broughton, the project manager of Bedford Foodbank. \"This past year we've been busy but there's no surprise there.

BSkyB sales boss Nick Milligan, 51, and his eight-year-old daughter Emily were thrown from the boat in the Camel Estuary, off Padstow, on Sunday. Four other family members struck by the boat were taken to hospital. Police said Mr Milligan's 39-year-old wife Victoria and their four-year-old son Kit remain in hospital with \"serious, potentially life-changing injuries\", while their two other daughters Amber, 12, and Olivia, 10, suffered minor injuries in the accident. The family are from Wandsworth in South West London. 'Much-loved pupil' Adrian Floyd, the headmaster of Finton House School in Tooting, said Emily was a \"bright, lively and much-loved Year 4 pupil\". He said the family had a \"long and close\" association with the school, which was also attended by Emily's brother and one of her sisters. Mr Milligan was one of the school governors and had been managing director of Sky's advertising sales division, Sky Media, since 2004. The injured family members were hit by the 8m (26ft)-long Cobra rigid inflatable boat (rib) - which can reach speeds of about 50mph (80km\/h) - while it was going round in circles.

Baron Cohen is a clever man (Cambridge University, incidentally) who would not ask such a question without a good reason. Which is why I'm taken aback. Am I his latest fall guy? It is unusual, too, to interview the comedian as himself. He has not previously given a formal interview to a British broadcaster, preferring instead to appear in character - Ali G, Borat, Bruno and now General Admiral Aladeen in The Dictator. It's not as if his new film needs extra publicity. It has had some decent reviews and has been \"tracking\" well as far as advance box office is concerned.

The comments come in response to Beijing's release of a paper blaming Washington for the setback in talks. The US reignited the trade war last month by raising tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate. The two countries have been in an escalating conflict over trade for the past year. The scope of the battle has expanded in recent months as Washington has tightened trade restrictions on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei. Hopes for an imminent trade deal were shattered in May after the Trump administration more than doubled tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3157.9bn) of Chinese imports and threatened additional duties. \"Our negotiating positions have been consistent throughout these talks, and China backpedalled on important elements of what the parties had agreed to,\" a statement from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) said. The statement said the US was \"disappointed\" the Chinese had chosen in recent public statements \"to pursue a blame game misrepresenting the nature and history of trade negotiations between the two countries\". Beijing released a \"White Paper\" on Sunday, which set out China's position in trade talks including some of its prerequisites for a deal. In the paper, China said in order to reach a deal \"the US should remove all additional tariffs imposed on Chinese exports\". While China was willing to work together with the US to reach a \"mutually beneficial and win-win agreement\", the paper said \"mutual respect\" was key. \"One side should not cross the other's 'red lines'. The right to development cannot be sacrificed, still the less can sovereignty be undermined,\" it said.

Sita is working with local farmers Michael Blakenham and Stephen Wright who operate under the name Sterling Suffolk. They own the land between Great Blakenham and Bramford where the greenhouses would be built.

On Sunday, Chinese authorities announced Mr Liu was under investigation for \"serious disciplinary violations\". Mr Liu has also been fired from his position as the deputy head of China's central National Development and Reform Commission. Last December, Caijing, the respected business magazine where Luo Changping, 32, serves as deputy editor, published an article accusing Liu Tienan's wife and son of illegal business dealings. The article did not mention Mr Liu by name. Instead, it simply stated he was a high-ranking official with the national economic planning committee. The investigative journalist, Luo Changping, was not so reserved. In three hard-hitting posts on weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, Mr Luo argued Liu Tienan and his family had enriched themselves by obtaining illegal loans from Chinese banks. Mr Liu was also accused of lying about his education and issuing death threats to his former mistress. Then, for months, both Mr Luo and the Chinese media fell silent on the topic. That is, until China's anti-corruption agency announced it was investigating Liu Tienan. After that, the floodgates opened. The Chinese media published reports on Liu Tienan's investigation and Mr Luo's own newspaper, Caijing, reposted his allegations on Caijing's weibo account.

Some 116 migrants remained aboard the Gregoretti for close to a week. On Wednesday, a majority of senators voted for the trial of the anti-immigration League leader to go ahead. Mr Salvini has repeatedly said he wants to go to court. He told the chamber he wanted \"to tell the world\" that his migration policies \"saved tens of thousands of lives.\" \"I am absolutely calm and proud of what I have done. And I'll do it again as soon as I get back into government,\" he said later. Senators from his League party left the chamber rather than take part in Wednesday's vote. Under Italian law, ministers have parliamentary immunity for actions taken while they were in office. But a committee voted last month to strip Mr Salvini of his immunity - leaving the final decision in the hands of the Senate on Wednesday. The upper house Senate voted 152-76 in favour of lifting the immunity. After the tally was announced, Mr Salvini compared himself to US President Donald Trump, who was impeached in December and accused opponents of undermining his electoral success through the courts. \"I, like Trump? He has a few more billions and a few more years, but it's a bad little habit of the left, going around in the world, to try to win by judicial means,\" he wrote on Twitter.

But tech news site Buzzfeed has found that videos sent to iPhones can be stored using a workaround. Snapchat said such \"reverse engineering\" was always going to be possible. Media browser Using a widely available file-browsing computer program Katie Notopoulos, a staff reporter at Buzzfeed, found that Snapchat and its Facebook equivalent Poke could be used to copy videos temporarily stored on handsets before the apps have been used to view them. The ability to send video via Snapchat was introduced on 14 December. When videos were loaded but not opened Ms Notopoulos discovered it was possible to get at and view these copies when users connected their iPhone to a computer and used a file browser to look through its internal memory. If videos were not viewed, she found, they were stored in a folder called \"tmp\" by Snapchat or \"mediacard\" on Facebook's Poke. Copying the files in these folders to a hard drive stopped them being automatically deleted. Snapchat is also available on Google Android phones. Ms Notopoulos did not try to find out if videos were preserved in the same way on such smartphones. However, earlier in December Snapchat did issue a patch for a bug that put permanent versions of unwatched videos into the media gallery on Android phones. Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel told Ms Notopoulos that those who enjoyed the service the most would not go to such lengths to view videos. \"There will always be ways to reverse engineer technology products - but that spoils the fun!\" he wrote.

The organisation has faced criticism for under investment in the city, once home to the fabled Pebble Mill studios. The BBC said the plans meant a \u00a310m boost for \"fresh talent and innovative digital content for young audiences\". The new investment is on top of an existing \u00a3125m already tied to the second city base in The Mailbox, it said. Under the plans, the commissioning, publishing and some production of BBC Three's short-form content, along with the social media team that supports it, would relocate to Birmingham by 2018. The channel, which targets 16 to 34-year-olds with a mix of comedy, documentaries and current affairs, went online only in February, to save \u00a330m. It will also still be based in London. A new youth team will also be set up at The Mailbox site, which will be the main suppliers of news content for the channel's Daily Drop, BBC Three's new, mobile-first platform. The local newspaper partnerships - outlined in September by director general Tony Hall as a pool of local reporters who will share work with local papers - are expected to be based in Birmingham alongside the English Regions HQ. \"These teams, together with Birmingham's young and diverse demographic, will be harnessed to act as part of the hub for the identification, development and commissioning of new diverse talent and programmes as announced in the BBC's Diversity and Inclusion strategy last month,\" a spokesman said. \"To support this, the BBC Academy will launch a new scheme, the Birmingham Production Apprenticeship, for new off-air talent from diverse backgrounds.\" Lord Hall said Birmingham had benefited from recent extra investment, but there was more to do. \"Now we're putting Birmingham at the heart of our innovation with BBC Three and making it home to a new youth team for BBC News. \"The city's incredible diversity also means it's the perfect place to lead our work to ensure we \n\nSummary:","461":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Over the past three years, gangs are said to have killed more than 800 rhinos for their horns, which can fetch \u00a322,000 ($35,055) per kg on the black market. Poachers use a chainsaw to cut away the rhino's horns, after darting it with a tranquilizer - drugged and helpless the animal bleeds to death. Large syndicates are involved in this multi-billion dollar trade worldwide - exporting the horns from Africa to parts of Asia and the Middle-East. Despite many anti-poaching measures 310 have been killed in South Africa this year, more than 330 had been killed at the end of last year - and the numbers are set to increase, experts warn. In the five years up to 2005, an average of 36 rhinos were killed each year. Some say today's efforts are \"too conventional\" and are not enough. Now South Africa has commissioned a study into whether legalising trade in rhino horn could in fact help to bring down poaching, the Department of Environmental Affairs announced recently. \"We are impartial at this stage but we are looking at all the suggestions which could help us in the fight against poachers,\" the department's spokesperson, Albie Modise, told the BBC. \"We are awaiting submissions and would consider this if we get authentic scientific backing that this would be effective,\" he said. The idea is that legalising rhino horn trade would make South Africa directly responsible for meeting the demand for the horns - taking power out of the hands of poachers and placing it in the hands authorities who would also be sensitive to current conservation efforts. These authorities would do market research into global markets of the trade, said Mr Modise. The department says rhino horn stock piles could also be sold to fund further rhino conservation efforts.

Malaria is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes, so protecting them could in turn protect people. The researchers are now investigating whether they can release infected mosquitoes into the wild, or use spores to suppress the disease. What is this microbe? The malaria-blocking bug, Microsporidia MB, was discovered by studying mosquitoes on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya. It lives in the gut and genitals of the insects. The researchers could not find a single mosquito carrying the Microsporidia that was harbouring the malaria parasite. And lab experiments, published in Nature Communications, confirmed the microbe gave the mosquitoes protection. Microsporidias are fungi, or at least closely related to them, and most are parasites. However, this new species may be beneficial to the mosquito and was naturally found in around 5% of the insects studied. How big a discovery is it? \"The data we have so far suggest it is 100% blockage, it's a very severe blockage of malaria,\" Dr Jeremy Herren, from the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) in Kenya told the BBC. He added: \"It will come as a quite a surprise. I think people will find that a real big breakthrough.\" More than 400,000 people are killed by malaria each year, most of them children under the age of five. While huge progress has been made through the use of bed nets and spraying homes with insecticide, this has stalled in recent years. It is widely agreed new tools are needed to tackle malaria. How does the microbe stop malaria? The fine details still need to be worked out. But Microsporidia MB could be priming the mosquito's immune system, so it is more able to fight off infections. Or the presence of the microbe in the insect could be having a profound effect on the mosquito's metabolism, making it inhospitable for the malaria parasite. \n\nSummary:","464":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The damning quotes were corroborated independently by The Associated Press. Veterans' groups are among those condemning Mr Trump, less than two months from the 2020 election. Progressive group VoteVets posted a video of families whose children had been killed in action. \"You don't know what it is to sacrifice,\" says one. Paul Rieckhoff of the Iraq & Afghanistan Veterans of America, tweeted: \"Who is really surprised by this?\" A small group of protesters waved placards at the president's motorcade on Saturday near the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. Mr Trump has often staked a claim to strong support among the military, and last year Pew Research Center found that veterans were generally supportive of him as commander-in-chief, with 57% in favour. Three-fifths of the veterans identified as Republican, the research found. What is Trump reported to have said? According to The Atlantic, when Mr Trump cancelled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery outside Paris in November 2018, 100 years after the end of World War One, he said it was \"filled with losers\". Four sources told the magazine he had rejected the idea of visiting because the rain would dishevel his hair, and he did not believe it important to honour America's war dead. During the same trip, the president also allegedly referred to 1,800 US soldiers who died at Belleau Wood as \"suckers\". The battle helped to prevent a German advance on Paris during World War One and is venerated by the US Marine Corps. The Atlantic's reporting was based on anonymous sources but a \"senior Defense Department official with first-hand knowledge of events\" and a \"senior U.S. Marine Corps officer who was told about Trump's comments\" confirmed the cemetery comments to AP.

The couple were on the Gold Coast as Hanks made a film about Elvis Presley. Production has been put on hold. There are currently 375 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia. Hanks, 63, said last Thursday on Instagram he had come down with the virus. \"We felt a bit tired, like we had colds and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too,\" he said in a post. He later followed up with another post, thanking \"everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us\". The Oscar-winning actor is not the only celebrity to have tested positive for the virus. British actor Idris Elba on Monday revealed he had tested positive. \"I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far. No panic,\" he said in a tweet. He was tested because he was \"exposed\" to someone who had tested positive, he said. He has been self-isolating since Friday. \"We live in a divided world, we all feel it...now's the time for solidarity,\" he added. According to Australia's Department of Health, there are currently 68 confirmed cases in Queensland, where Hanks is located. Australia's prime minister on Monday ordered a 14-day self-isolation period for anyone arriving in the country. \"We know that the virus cannot be absolutely stopped... but we can slow the spread,\" said Scott Morrison.

Its Harvard University developers say tiny robots like theirs may eventually be used in rescue operations. It could, for example, navigate through tiny spaces in collapsed buildings. The development is reported in the journal Science. Dr Kevin Ma from Harvard University and his team, led by Dr Robert Wood, say they have made the world's smallest flying robot. It also has the fly-like agility that allows the insects to evade even the swiftest of human efforts to swat them. This comes largely from very precise wing movements. By constantly adjusting the effect of lift and thrust acting on its body at an incredibly high speed, the insect's (and the robot's) wings enable it to hover, or to perform sudden evasive manoeuvres. And just like a real fly, the robot's thin, flexible wings beat approximately 120 times every second. The researchers achieved this wing speed with special substance called piezoelectric material, which contracts every time a voltage is applied to it. By very rapidly switching the voltage on and off, the scientists were able to make this material behave like just like the tiny muscles that makes a fly's wings beat so fast. \"We get it to contract and relax, like biological muscle,\" said Dr Ma. The main goal of this research was to understand how insect flight works, rather than to build a useful robot. He added though that there could be many uses for such a diminutive flying vehicle. \"We could envision these robots being used for search-and-rescue operations to search for human survivors under collapsed buildings or [in] other hazardous environments,\" he said. \"They [could] be used for environmental monitoring, to be dispersed into a habitat to sense trace chemicals or other factors.

Their cost would be capped at \u00a3250m each. Harland and Wolff's Jonathan Guest said the company could bring its \"commercial edge\" to the plans. \"These are meant to be really good ships that have an export capability,\" he said. \"The idea of being able to build them in different shipyards around the country is really the essence of what the national shipbuilding strategy is trying to do - getting multiple industrial partners involved and we'd very much like to hope that Harland and Wolff would be one of those. \"Unfortunately, Harland and Wolff haven't been part of any of the naval shipbuilding to date, we have found that a little bit of a closed shop to try and break into. \"So certainly we have turned our efforts into the much more commercial areas in the oil and gas space and more recently the renewable space. \"We would like to bring the commercial edge that we have to the MoD and we could see that as being only a win-win situation for them.\" The Ministry of Defence accepted recommendations from the former chief executive of Harland and Wolff about its strategy for building navy ships.

UK rules state more than 25% of shares should be listed to stop a single shareholder having too much dominance. But proposals put forward by the FCA in January could allow for exceptions. The regulator has proposed waiving a number of requirements for sovereign-owned companies. What's the fuss about Saudi Aramco and the London market? These include the need to provide independent shareholders with their own separate vote on the appointment of independent directors, which can potentially delay the process by up to 90 days. An FCA consultation on the proposed changes will close on 13 October and the regulator will make a policy statement before the end of the year. According to reports, Saudi Aramco could be valued at $2tn (\u00a31.5tn) when it lists - a huge price tag that would also generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for investment bankers, lawyers and other professional firms involved in stock market flotations. 'Diminished' standards The call for clarity comes in a letter addressed to FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey and signed by Nicky Morgan and Rachel Reeves, who chair the Treasury and business select committees respectively.

In May of this year, Theresa May accompanied the boss of the London Stock Exchange to Riyadh on a charm offensive and one of questions underlying Nicky Morgan and Rachel Reeves' letter to the FCA is whether there was any improper influence exerted on an independent watchdog by government.

Sajid Javid said the fees had been waived. A spokesman for the translators said they were \"delighted\" with the news. But the group asked that their families be allowed to join them. Currently, the interpreters' wives and children are not allowed to live in the UK unless they travelled at the same time as those given permits. The group called this a \"miserable injustice\" because it was not possible for many families to gain the necessary documents to travel at the time. The group also said they were having to pay more than \u00a31,000 to get proper documentation for children born in the UK. The home secretary said about 400 former Afghan interpreters had relocated to the UK as part of the government scheme. Mr Javid said: \"The local Afghan interpreters worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk. \"We have always been clear that they will be able to stay in the UK with their families and today I have announced that they will be able to do this for free.\" He added that the Home Office was \"looking again at what can be done\" to make it easier for the interpreters to bring their wives and children into the country.

The Archibald Knox Forum hopes to display pieces held by museums and dealers and in private collections. The display is planned for 2024, the 160th anniversary of Knox's birth. The forum's Chris Hobdell said holding the exhibition on the Isle of Man would allow people to see \"the island that inspired him\". Born in 1864 in Tromode, Knox chose not to follow in his father's engineering footsteps and instead, enrolled at the newly-opened Douglas School of Art at the age of 16. He went on to become the primary designer for Liberty of London and his pioneering work was key to the company's success and influence upon UK and international design. Alongside the exhibition itself, guided tours and lectures will be held outlining the places that the artist depicted in many of his artworks and the cultural heritage behind several of his designs. Mr Hobdell said: \"I want people to see what about the history and culture and landscape of the Isle of Man, what effect it had on him, and how it inspired him to do the wonderful works he did because all his work is bound up in Manx and Celtic history and tradition.\" The forum previously held an exhibition of the designer's work at the Manx Museum in 2018.

GoFundMe had removed \"multiple\" campaigns for Mr Fields, a spokesman told Reuters. \"Those campaigns did not raise any money, and they were immediately removed,\" said director of strategic communications Bobby Whithorne. Kickstarter and Indiegogo, fellow crowdfunding platforms, said they had not seen any campaigns in support of Mr Fields and a spokesman for Kickstarter pointed out that the site did not allow fund-raising for personal needs or legal defence. Both platforms added that they were monitoring the situation. A check by the BBC found no evidence of such fundraising efforts on any of the three sites. There are several GoFundMe campaigns in support of victims injured while protesting against the white nationalist march. However, there are at least two campaigns in support of those who marched at Charlottesville at an \"alternative\" crowd-funding site called Rootbocks, which uses the slogan: \"No Censorship.

He told BBC Wales: \"There are fewer people waiting overall in the Welsh NHS than before. \"The number of people waiting over 26 weeks has come down but I am disappointed to see the rise in people waiting over 36 weeks. \"I've made it clear to local health boards, even in the difficult period over the winter, I expect them to concentrate on those longer waiters and I do expect to see those figures coming down.\" 'Increasingly worsening crisis' Official figures also show 88% of people waited less than 26 weeks to start treatment. The target is 95%. Mr Drakeford said it was up to the local health boards to manage the situation and speeding up waiting times \"has to be the priority\" for the Welsh NHS. But Conservative health spokesman Darren Millar described the situation as an \"increasingly worsening crisis\". \"The minister's only answer is to review his own targets.

Scanning the company's blog, I found that I was one of a select few. Just 250,000 out of 200 million active users have been warned that \"limited information\" may have fallen into the hands of hackers. Early adopters Twitter is emphasising that it acted rapidly to warn people the moment that it spotted the danger - but there is still little information about the nature of the attack or why just one small section of users is in danger. From what I can see, most of the people who've received the email are early adopters, those who joined Twitter in 2007 or earlier. Is there an early database which is not as secure as the systems brought in as Twitter took off? Who is behind the attack? Twitter is linking it to those on the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal which have been widely blamed on Chinese hackers.

That has a subtle impact on the choices people make when signing up and picking a word or phrase to form a supposedly super-secret password. It's just one of the many quirks to be found in the password-picking habits of us humans. There are plenty of others. For example studies suggest red-haired women tend to choose the best passwords and men with bushy beards or unkempt hair, the worst. These studies also reveal that when it comes to passwords, women prefer length and men diversity. Big data These facts have come to light thanks to the vast number of passwords that have been stolen from websites and online services, says security researcher Per Thorsheim. Adobe, LinkedIn and game website RockYou have all been hit in breaches that involved the theft of login names and passwords. Add to this the steady drip of security breaches at other firms and you have a vast corpus of data that can shed light on what passwords people pick. The number one conclusion from looking at that data - people are lousy at picking good passwords. \"You have to remember we are all human and we all make mistakes,\" says Mr Thorsheim. In this sense, he says, a good password would be a phrase or combination of characters that has little or no connection to the person picking it. All too often, Mr Thorsheim adds, people use words or numbers intimately linked to them. They use birthdays, wedding days, the names of siblings or children or pets. They use their house number, street name or pick on a favourite pop star. This bias is most noticeable when it comes to the numbers people pick when told to choose a four digit pin. Analysis of their choices suggests that people drift towards a small subset of the 10,000 available.

The vice-president of the United States also told the Ireland Fund's gala dinner in Washington on Thursday what was wrong with the Northern Ireland peace process: there was still too much fear, too much mistrust, and too many missed opportunities. Mr Biden had shared a table with the first and deputy first minister in the Ronald Reagan Centre. And in his address, he praised their courage and acknowledged it was a struggle to bring to fruition the Good Friday Agreement. His words of praise were mixed with encouragement, poetic advice and prayerful wishes. But the message was firm. It was time to move on and break out of the nightmare of the past. \"Dignity like peace doesn't live on paper. It lives in our hearts. It's about treating people with respect regardless of the past, regardless of our ancestry, regardless of what has gone before. It's universal.

The pair have teamed up together to work on a new underwear line as part of Skepta's MAINS fashion collection. For the GQ cover shoot, both Skepta and Naomi Campbell are pictured in the brand's boxer shorts. GQ haven't released any more pictures or details of the interview with the pair but says they talk about \"race, sex, love and power\". Although they've never confirmed an official relationship, fans have speculated for a while that they're more than friends. Skepta, whose real name is Joseph Junior Adenuga, has had a meteoric rise and is currently viewed as one of the trailblazers of the grime music scene. That was cemented last year when the 35-year-old's album, Konnichiwa, won the Mercury prize for album of the year. As for Naomi Campbell, 47, she remains one of the most iconic supermodels on the planet. Her CV includes being the first black model to open for fashion house Prada when she walked during Milan Fashion Week back in 1997. She's now a contributing editor for British Vogue and spends a lot of her time campaigning for various charities and causes around the world. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

It said its intention was to stop Cuadrilla drilling during the event, between 16 and 21 August. The energy firm is drilling boreholes at the site as demonstrations continue. No Dash For Gas members occupied two 300ft (90m) chimneys at the EDF Energy gas-fired facility at West Burton in Nottinghamshire in October and November last year. 'Upping the ante' Twenty one people were charged with aggravated trespass after the sit-in, with 16 receiving community orders and five being conditionally discharged at Nottingham Magistrates' Court. The group said it expected up to 500 people to attend its Reclaim The Power action camp and was in discussions with local landowners about a location. Spokeswoman Ewa Jasiewicz said: \"We will be taking a diversity of action. Our intention is to stop Cuadrilla and to stop drilling in Balcombe, the local people want that. \"We believe that Balcombe is a test case for rolling out fracking across the country. We felt that it was far more relevant for us and local people to come to Balcombe. \"Obviously some people will be concerned. There will be a big influx of people into the area and we'll be upping the ante [on Cuadrilla] but people have called for that.\" She added: \"We're putting letters through the letterboxes of hundreds of residents from today.\" The group said it had not yet spoken to Sussex Police about the action camp but they were planning to \"have dialogue with them\". 'No threat to village' More than 30 people have been arrested at the demonstration in Balcombe, mainly on suspicion of obstructing deliveries, including the daughter of Kinks star Ray Davies and Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde's daughter, Natalie Hynde. Campaigners fear the test drilling at Balcombe could lead to hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking. Cuadrilla has said it would need fresh permission to carry out fracking.

The dig continues until 18 July. Lead archaeologist Tony Roberts said: \"The walls uncovered so far are some of the best preserved that I have witnessed in a number of years excavating.\" He said an \"older, hitherto unknown building\" could be beneath the ground. Mr Roberts said a geophysical survey indicated there were a lot more walls and rooms under the front lawn than just those of the old wing that housed the 18th Century stables. The walls that have been uncovered are about 1.5 ft (0.5m) high, with the floor levels yet to be reached. The excavation is being conducted by archaeologists Archeoscan.

It's leading to an increase in hospital admissions, according to researchers, because users are not always aware of purity levels. And young women are more likely to end up in an emergency department. Dr Adam Winstock from the Global Drug Survey, or GDS, explained to Newsbeat why the new higher levels are such a problem. \"A dose of about 80mg of MDMA for most people, without tolerance and assuming average body weight, gives them the pleasurable effects of energy, euphoria and empathy,\" he explained. \"[These] outweigh the negative effects that become more common with bigger doses such as nausea, panic, paranoia, agitation and gurning. \"Higher doses tend to leave people feeling too wasted for too long and being less able to enjoy the people around them and their environment. \"The current average dose of MDMA used in a session across many countries is over 200mg. \"GDS thinks for most people this is too much.\" It says higher dose pills and high purity MDMA powders can make it very easy for users to take too much. This backs up a major report from international drug experts. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction warned in May that ecstasy and MDMA is getting stronger with dangerously \"pure\" pills and crystals in circulation. Its latest report highlights a \"recent resurgence in use of MDMA in Europe and increased availability of high-strength MDMA tablets and powders\". \"2016 might be the worst time to start taking MDMA in a generation,\" Dr Adam Winstock told Newsbeat. \"MDMA has never been so plentiful and as GDS trend data shows, more and more people are using it. \"The rising popularity of EDM and dispersion of MDMA from the dance floor to mainstream drug culture has coincided with resurgence of MDMA availability.\" The authors of the reports say it is time people learned how to be safer.

Her mother Sharon Lee from Gosport, Hampshire, has questioned the Royal Military Police (RMP) investigation and said she felt \"brushed over\". In a letter, David Cameron said \"considerable resources\" were assigned to re-examining the case. Katrice went missing on her second birthday while she and her family were shopping for party food in a NAAFI shop in Paderborn. Her father, from Teesside, was stationed at the base at the time. Gosport Conservative MP Caroline Dinenage asked for an inquiry into the \"chronic mishandling\" of the case by the Royal Military Police (RMP). The family maintain the military police failed to interview key witnesses quickly enough after the disappearance. During Prime Minister's Questions in April, David Cameron had agreed to look into the case. In a subsequent letter to Ms Dinenage, the prime minister said: \"I can only imagine the grief and heartbreak that Katrice's disappearance must be causing.\" He said the RMP had \"considerable resources assigned to re-examining this case and are using modern investigative techniques to try and identify anything that was not identified by the initial investigation and subsequent reviews\". The letter stopped short of offering the independent inquiry into how the military police initially handled the case which Mrs Lee has been demanding. Mrs Lee also said she had not been given access to a review carried out by South Wales Police in 2002 which has not been made public. \"I really cannot comprehend why we seem to be stonewalled every avenue we try to go down to find out the truth about Katrice's case. \"That's all I'm asking for, the truth about how the initial investigation was carried out. \"We have to regroup and think of another avenue but I'm not giving up,\" she said.

The Scottish government has already ended right to buy for new tenants, amid concern over a shortage of rented affordable homes. Right to buy has also been suspended by a number of local authorities. Ministers are currently considering proposals to protect and increase the supply of affordable housing. The government's consultation on the issue got 169 responses in total from registered social landlords, tenant and resident groups, councils, charities and others. Of the 161 respondents which answered the question on ending right to buy altogether, 83% said the policy - introduced in the early 80s - should go. In all, 92% of social landlords, 81% of councils and 80% of tenant and resident groups which responses said right to buy should be scrapped. Policy suspended The policy was introduced by the Thatcher government to make owning a home more affordable and, since its introduction, more than 500,000 homes have been sold in Scotland. But in recent years councils have been forced to suspend the policy, as their stock of social housing to rent has dwindled. The Scottish government's 2010 Housing Act brought in several changes, including ending right to buy for new council and social housing tenants, alongside a three-year \u00a31.5bn house-building plan. Ministers said stopping all new tenants from buying their homes could see up to 18,000 properties retained over 10 years. The Scottish government said it would respond to the consultation in due course.\n\nSummary:","488":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The spectacle at Richmond Park in south-west London often draws crowds of camera-carrying nature lovers. \"The most I've seen is 60 photographers encircling a stag,\" said Adam Curtis, the park's assistant manager. He explained that the photographers' behaviour in the deer mating season could \"disturb natural selection\". \"The stags or bucks try to keep groups of females in one place, which is physically exhausting,\" he said. \"If they are disturbed while trying to entertain their harem, the dominant stags don't get the opportunity to mate and when the females come into season at a later date, young bachelors mate with the females instead. \"This could affect the quality of the herd. \"If they mate later, the females could also give birth over a longer period of time, which means they would be more vulnerable for longer,\" he said. Richmond Park has the \"most photographed deer in the world,\" said Mr Curtis. Typically, he sees \"20 to 30 people crowding around a deer\" on a daily basis during mating season, with more at weekends. He warned that people and their dogs risk serious injury if they get too close. \"This year, a deer caught sight of its own reflection in a car and head-butted it, thinking it was another deer,\" Mr Curtis said. \"It must have been scary for the person inside.\"\n\nSummary:","489":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Federation of Master Builders said the planning system was too \"complex, difficult and costly to navigate\". The government said last year saw the largest percentage increase in new homes in nine years. Overall, some 217,000 new homes were built in 2016-17, two-thirds of the government target of 300,000. These include conversions of existing buildings, as well as new homes. Our analysis also found: James Prestwich, head of policy at the National Housing Federation, said around 340,000 homes should be built in England every year. He said: \"We haven't been building the homes the country needs for some considerable time. It's been about 40 years or more since we last built enough homes to keep pace with demand,\" he said. Four ways to tackle the housing crisis 1. Simplify the planning process Andrew Dixon, of the Federation of Master Builders, said: \"Since the financial crisis, finance has been harder to come by. \"The planning system has become much more complex, difficult and costly to navigate. It's disproportionately costly for small builders. The planning process is essentially the same for a five unit development as it is for a 500 unit development. \"But the biggest factor is the lack of availability of smaller sites and smaller development opportunities, and I think the planning system has played a major role in that.\" 2. Build in cities Anthony Breach, of the Centre for Cities think tank, said: \"There's been a massive failure to build enough housing in the cities where demand has been highest over the past 25 or 30 years. \"It's not even just a big city problem.

Health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the SNP had pledged to increase bed numbers but they were now falling. The Scottish government said the figures reflected shorter stays and better treatments and that Labour had cut 1,300 hospital Scottish beds. The figures showed a drop of 1,148 beds between 2007 and 2010. The biggest decline was in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which had cut 333 beds in the past three years. NHS Grampian cut 180 beds and NHS Highland 162. Ms Baillie said: \"Although advances in medical practice mean patients don't need to spend so long in hospital and more people with long-term conditions are treated in the community, the health secretary, Nicola Sturgeon, promised in opposition to increase the number of hospital beds. \"Instead, the number of beds has fallen by over 1,100 in the last three years. The SNP are also planning to cut 1,500 nurses jobs this year. The fact is that they are guilty of the most staggering hypocrisy.\" Out-patient treatment Ms Sturgeon said one of the reasons Labour were thrown out of office in Scotland was because of their \"wretched\" record on health, cutting hospital beds by 1,300. She added: \"The truth is that there is record investment in Scotland's NHS under the SNP. If Labour had been returned to office in 2007, they would have closed the A&E units at Monklands and Ayr, and they were pledged to cut Scotland's health budget and transfer the cash elsewhere. \"In contrast, the SNP government saved the A&E units, and are building a brand new Southern General Hospital.\" Ms Sturgeon said fewer long-stay beds for elderly or disabled people were needed, through care in the home or community, and that medical advances had reduced the length of hospital stay, with many procedures done on an out-patient basis.\n\nSummary:","491":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

In March, Mr Garmston was given 12 months notice by Shropshire Council of their plans to evict him. He asked a cat rehoming charity for help with the 30 cats that have formed a colony on the farm. Shropshire Street Cats said thousands had seen the post with many offering to take in the felines. Jane Jones, from the group, said: \"I think it is nearly 150,000 [views] so far... so let us hope that translates into some good accommodation for the cats.\" \"I have got to find somewhere to live, go out and get a job, give up my business, my livelihood, all my animals and I am finding it difficult,\" Mr Garmston said. He sold his milking herd last year when his contract with a milking company ended but still has 10 cows alongside the cats, who he feeds biscuits and cat food. The authority defended its actions after some Facebook users criticised the council's treatment of Mr Garmston. Director of place, Mark Barrow, said they had to make difficult decisions, \"If there was to be a renewal [of the tenancy], it would need a substantial amount of money investing in it that we could not justify.\" The council has offered to help Mr Garmston and give him a grace period.

Legal action was taken against Whatton, HMP Stafford and the Ministry of Justice after the couple were only allowed to communicate through letters. A High Court judge said the restrictions were \"disproportionate\". The 45-year-old who brought the claim was given an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence in 2006 for sexual assault of a child under 13, with a minimum term of just over one year. Her 32-year-old wife was also given an IPP in 2009 for possessing indecent images, with a minimum term set at 18 months. Soon after the pair married, the claimant said she was moved to a different prison without warning and given no chance to say goodbye to her wife. After all contact was initially banned, the pair, who have not been named, were allowed to write letters to each other, but phone calls and visits remained prohibited. Mr Justice Morris said the video links from their respective prisons during the case were the first times they had seen or heard each other in almost four years. 'No explanation' Both prisons and the Ministry of Justice argued the couple posed a risk to each other and the wider community, and that the risk was too great to allow face-to-face or telephone contact. However, in a judgement on Friday, Mr Morris said the restrictions were \"unnecessary and disproportionate\", adding there was a lack of \"firm evidence\" for putting them in place. While acknowledging the ongoing risk the claimant provides and the \"challenges for those entrusted with their care within prison\", he said \"no explanation\" had been given for why the couple had been placed in separate prisons. \"It is not clear how restricting contact with the claimant is likely to reduce her ongoing sexual interest in children,\" he said. \"There is no evidence to suggest that it will.\" The judge also awarded the claimant an unspecified amount in damages, finding she had suffered \"substantial anxiety, frustration\n\nSummary:","493":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Now, the area has one of the lowest infection rates in Wales - and it currently ranks 185th in the UK's list of hardest hit areas, as analysed by the BBC. But for two weeks running in August, Wrexham had more deaths involving Covid-19 than anywhere else in the UK. The consequence of that earlier spike was showing itself. That is why public health officials are closely watching any part of Wales which shows signs of a jump in cases. What are we looking for? Daily blips can happen, so health officials look at the case rate over the last week - the proportion of positive tests per 100,000 population. They also look at the positivity rate - how many people tested actually turn out to have Covid-19 - and with more than 9,000 being tested a day now, when that gets above 4% it becomes concerning. In Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), this rate is currently 5.7% - the highest proportion in Wales and double the national average. Health officials are also looking closely at where people with infections are living. Is it confined to their circle of family and friends or in the wider community? With the easing of lockdown, pockets and clusters of cases were expected. The Welsh Government's track and trace system so far has a very high success rate, so knowing exactly where the infections are, and keeping a lid on the problem when it occurs, is key. Officials can access micro-data, so they can tell which neighbourhoods are affected. When they start to see a lot of cases that they can't track back to a source case then that's a strong indicator that there's community transmission. It means efforts to specifically isolate groups or individuals have failed to contain the virus. When that occurs it makes the prospect of a local lockdown far more likely. This is what happened in RCT. When cases move up too fast - and too high - loc\n\nSummary:","494":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He said: \"Alistair Carmichael has been found by the court to have lied to his electorate. \"The fact that he has won has not exonerated him.\" A spokeswoman for the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards confirmed an inquiry into Mr Carmichael was ''ongoing''.

The plan aims to remove barriers to membership of the assembly - with additional support for AMs on parental leave and those with disabilities. Plaid Cymru AM Bethan Sayed said she was \"deeply uncomfortable\" with a childcare plan for AMs but not others. Members of the public can have their say on the changes until March 2020. If they go ahead the changes will come into force in May 2021, when the next assembly term starts. Dame Dawn Primarolo, chairwoman of the Remuneration Board, said the proposals were aimed at contributing \"towards achieving diversity within the Senedd's membership which in turn will deliver better representation for the people of Wales\". AMs are currently paid \u00a367,649 a year, changing annually according to how much average wages in Wales rise or fall. That system would continue. The board is not recommending a significant pay rise like it had in 2014, when the board sparked a row by backing a \u00a310,000 increase. Under the plans, members would be able to claim up to \u00a3297 for the care of children or adult dependants outside of normal working hours - classed as between 9am and 6pm. AMs would need to produce evidence of using registered care providers. The board also proposed allowing AMs going on parental leave to take on an additional staff member while they are off work. There were calls for more help for assembly members on parental leave earlier this year. Ms Sayed, who is currently pregnant, said extra money for politician's childcare \"needs to be part of wider legislation that would benefit the public at the same time as any such proposal - or even before any such proposals - for AMs\". \"I feel deeply uncomfortable with the idea of having an extra financial offer for AM's, when other women and parents are not afforded that same right, even though they too may be working un-social hours,\" she said. \"I agree that we need a plan for attracti\n\nSummary:","498":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Of 146,247 votes cast, she originally polled about 9,800 ballots to Mr Ozouf's 10,062. In the recount, his vote increased by 18, while hers went up by nine. Mr Ozouf said international election observers would help reinforce the island's democratic standards. He said: \"The thing I am now going to be pressing for is for our law to be changed in Jersey to allow international election observers to be present for the whole of the election and not just the count. \"Then for the day after the election to make a statement as to whether or not the election has been carried out in a free, fair and accurate way.\"\n\nSummary:"},"true_label":{"0":true,"1":true,"2":true,"3":true,"4":true,"5":true,"6":true,"7":true,"8":true,"9":true,"10":true,"11":true,"12":true,"13":true,"14":true,"15":true,"16":true,"17":true,"18":true,"19":true,"20":true,"21":true,"22":true,"23":true,"24":true,"25":true,"26":true,"27":true,"28":true,"29":true,"30":true,"31":true,"32":true,"33":true,"34":true,"35":true,"36":true,"37":true,"38":true,"39":true,"40":true,"41":true,"42":true,"43":true,"44":true,"45":true,"46":true,"47":true,"48":true,"49":true,"50":true,"51":true,"52":true,"53":true,"54":true,"55":true,"56":true,"57":true,"58":true,"59":true,"60":true,"61":true,"62":true,"63":true,"64":true,"65":true,"66":true,"67":true,"68":true,"69":true,"70":true,"71":true,"72":true,"73":true,"74":true,"75":true,"76":true,"77":true,"78":true,"79":true,"80":true,"81":true,"82":true,"83":true,"84":true,"85":true,"86":true,"87":true,"88":true,"89":true,"90":true,"91":true,"92":true,"93":true,"94":true,"95":true,"96":true,"97":true,"98":true,"99":true,"100":true,"101":true,"102":true,"103":true,"104":true,"105":true,"106":true,"107":true,"108":true,"109":true,"110":true,"111":true,"112":true,"113":true,"114":true,"115":true,"116":true,"117":true,"118":true,"119":true,"120":true,"121":true,"122":true,"123":true,"124":true,"125":true,"126":true,"127":true,"128":true,"129":true,"130":true,"131":true,"132":true,"133":true,"134":true,"135":true,"136":true,"137":true,"138":true,"139":true,"140":true,"141":true,"142":true,"143":true,"144":true,"145":true,"146":true,"147":true,"148":true,"149":true,"150":true,"151":true,"152":true,"153":true,"154":true,"155":true,"156":true,"157":true,"158":true,"159":true,"160":true,"161":true,"162":true,"163":true,"164":true,"165":true,"166":true,"167":true,"168":true,"169":true,"170":true,"171":true,"172":true,"173":true,"174":true,"175":true,"176":true,"177":true,"178":true,"179":true,"180":true,"181":true,"182":true,"183":true,"184":true,"185":true,"186":true,"187":true,"188":true,"189":true,"190":true,"191":true,"192":true,"193":true,"194":true,"195":true,"196":true,"197":true,"198":true,"199":true,"200":true,"201":true,"202":true,"203":true,"204":true,"205":true,"206":true,"207":true,"208":true,"209":true,"210":true,"211":true,"212":true,"213":true,"214":true,"215":true,"216":true,"217":true,"218":true,"219":true,"220":true,"221":true,"222":true,"223":true,"224":true,"225":true,"226":true,"227":true,"228":true,"229":true,"230":true,"231":true,"232":true,"233":true,"234":true,"235":true,"236":true,"237":true,"238":true,"239":true,"240":true,"241":true,"242":true,"243":true,"244":true,"245":true,"246":true,"247":true,"248":true,"249":true,"250":false,"251":false,"252":false,"253":false,"254":false,"255":false,"256":false,"257":false,"258":false,"259":false,"260":false,"261":false,"262":false,"263":false,"264":false,"265":false,"266":false,"267":false,"268":false,"269":false,"270":false,"271":false,"272":false,"273":false,"274":false,"275":false,"276":false,"277":false,"278":false,"279":false,"280":false,"281":false,"282":false,"283":false,"284":false,"285":false,"286":false,"287":false,"288":false,"289":false,"290":false,"291":false,"292":false,"293":false,"294":false,"295":false,"296":false,"297":false,"298":false,"299":false,"300":false,"301":false,"302":false,"303":false,"304":false,"305":false,"306":false,"307":false,"308":false,"309":false,"310":false,"311":false,"312":false,"313":false,"314":false,"315":false,"316":false,"317":false,"318":false,"319":false,"320":false,"321":false,"322":false,"323":false,"324":false,"325":false,"326":false,"327":false,"328":false,"329":false,"330":false,"331":false,"332":false,"333":false,"334":false,"335":false,"336":false,"337":false,"338":false,"339":false,"340":false,"341":false,"342":false,"343":false,"344":false,"345":false,"346":false,"347":false,"348":false,"349":false,"350":false,"351":false,"352":false,"353":false,"354":false,"355":false,"356":false,"357":false,"358":false,"359":false,"360":false,"361":false,"362":false,"363":false,"364":false,"365":false,"366":false,"367":false,"368":false,"369":false,"370":false,"371":false,"372":false,"373":false,"374":false,"375":false,"376":false,"377":false,"378":false,"379":false,"380":false,"381":false,"382":false,"383":false,"384":false,"385":false,"386":false,"387":false,"388":false,"389":false,"390":false,"391":false,"392":false,"393":false,"394":false,"395":false,"396":false,"397":false,"398":false,"399":false,"400":false,"401":false,"402":false,"403":false,"404":false,"405":false,"406":false,"407":false,"408":false,"409":false,"410":false,"411":false,"412":false,"413":false,"414":false,"415":false,"416":false,"417":false,"418":false,"419":false,"420":false,"421":false,"422":false,"423":false,"424":false,"425":false,"426":false,"427":false,"428":false,"429":false,"430":false,"431":false,"432":false,"433":false,"434":false,"435":false,"436":false,"437":false,"438":false,"439":false,"440":false,"441":false,"442":false,"443":fal

This is an ancient legal principle that requires at least two pieces of evidence to prove guilt in a criminal trial. The top prosecutor, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, thinks that this requirement is denying access to justice to victims of crimes committed in private. In particular, he points to the high number of rape and sexual assault cases that do not proceed to trial because of insufficient evidence. However, some legal experts fear that this move could increase the likelihood of miscarriages of justice. In particular, the former Lord President of the Court of Session, Lord Hamilton, and the former senior judge, Lord Cullen, have expressed concern about the risk of wrongful convictions without corroboration.

The study also found that the French military underestimated the amount of radiation exposure that the local population experienced as a result of the nuclear tests conducted between 1966 and 1974. The 41st test in 1974 was particularly significant as the atomic cloud took a different trajectory than planned, exposing the local population to significant amounts of ionizing radiation. The area where the tests were conducted was home to 110,000 people, and the radiation exposure from the tests was between two and 10 times higher than the estimates provided by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) in a 2006 report. One of the reasons for the discrepancy between the CEA report and the study's findings is that the CEA did not always take into account the drinking of contaminated rainwater when calculating the dose of radiation that individuals were likely to have been exposed to. The study also found that eight members of one family developed cancer as a result of the nuclear tests conducted in French Polynesia.

The Gwent Levels form part of the Severn Estuary floodplains, an internationally recognized area of special environmental value, and contain numerous wetlands, meadows, and other ecosystems that are home to many rare and protected species of plants and animals. Natural Resources Wales (NRW), the government agency responsible for environmental regulation, has been consulting on the project since it was first announced, and raised several concerns about the project's environmental impact on the Gwent Levels. In particular, NRW expressed concerns about the loss of habitat, the disturbance of wildlife, and the degradation of water quality that could result from the construction of the motorway. The agency also raised concerns about the potential for increased pollution from road traffic, and the risks to human health from exposure to air pollution and other hazardous materials. Despite the efforts of government officials and NRW staff to resolve the issues raised by the agency, some of the concerns could not be addressed to NRW's satisfaction.","75":"riot police\" unit.

Those on the party\u2019s left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worried whether the party\u2019s positioning on the issue is right. Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir\u2019s call for any council tax increases to be scrapped. But in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families. And in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives.

The court found that the information provided by the company was inaccurate at times and made false representations about the risks of the mesh products. The ruling is one of a series of lawsuits that J&J faces over the mesh products, which have been linked to severe complications such as chronic pain, bleeding, and discomfort during sexual intercourse. The court awarded damages to the claimant, Julie Davis, who had suffered as a result of the mesh products. Ethicon defended its record and said it would consider appealing the decision, but the Australian government issued a national apology to women affected by the mesh in 2022, acknowledging decades of pain and suffering caused by the mesh products. Mounting lawsuits over the mesh products in other countries, as well as lawsuits over other products such as opioids and talc, continue to pose a threat to the company's reputation and financial stability.","84":"The prime minister of the United Kingdom has been in power for over a month, and in that time he has been in power for over a month.

This decision comes in the wake of a series of political setbacks faced by the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), including losses in state parliament elections in Bavaria and Hesse. The CDU and its national coalition partners, the Social Democrats, saw a ten point drop in support in the recent election in the state of Hesse. This is the latest in a series of losses suffered by the major centre parties following the 2017 general election, as parties like the left-leaning Greens and the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) have gained in popularity. Merkel has faced criticism from some in her party over her decision to welcome over a million refugees into the country in 2015, and the growing support for right-wing populist parties has been seen as a backlash against this policy. Despite these setbacks, Merkel has insisted that she will continue to lead the country until the end of her term in December, and has said that she will not make any decisions about her political future until that time.","96":"North Korea has recently tested its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, in a provocative move that has heightened tensions in the region.

The Queen\u2019s Speech, the first of the new Parliament, contained a number of proposals that Labour had opposed, including the continued implementation of the pay cap. The government won the vote on the issue, but Labour\u2019s amendment to the Queen\u2019s Speech, which also called for an end to cuts to the police and emergency services, was defeated by a majority of 14. This showed that the Conservatives still have a majority in the House of Commons, but the defeat on the Queen\u2019s Speech issue demonstrated that the party is still vulnerable on the issue of austerity.","121":"Barbaric forces of evil and destruction.

She left the plantation, in Dorchester County, Maryland, in September and travelled by night. Her exact route is unknown, but she probably walked along the Choptank river and journeyed through Delaware, guided by the North Star. Years later, she recalled the moment she entered Pennsylvania, where slavery was illegal: \"When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through the trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven.\" In the years that followed, Tubman returned again and again to Maryland to rescue others, conducting them along the so-called \"underground railroad\", a network of safe houses used to spirit slaves from the South to the free states in the North.

This incident has raised awareness about hazing, a practice in which members of a group, often a sports team or fraternity, subject new members to physical or emotional harm in order to initiate them into the group. Hazing can include physical violence, sexual coercion, and other forms of emotional or physical abuse. Despite its harmful effects, hazing is still widely practiced in many organizations, including fraternities, sororities, and sports teams. In fact, a recent study found that 55% of college students experience some form of hazing, whether in fraternities, sororities, marching bands, varsity sports, or intramural sports. Hazing is often seen as a rite of passage or a means of building group solidarity, but its negative consequences, particularly in cases of extreme physical abuse or sexual assault, are becoming more widely recognized. In recent years, several high-profile hazing incidents, such as the death of Robert Champion, have led to increased scrutiny of hazing","241":"##### Do you need a similar assignment done for you from scratch?

The decision comes after weeks of protests, and the NASPA has been under pressure to make the change since last year, following the death of George Floyd. However, the NASPA still allowed offensive terms in its word lists, despite Hasbro, the owner of Scrabble in North America, banning the same terms since 1994. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the NASPA had agreed to remove offensive language from its lexicon, which is overseen by the NASPA Advisory Board and is available only to members. This move could also affect the online versions of the game, as the NASPA licenses its word lists to software developers. The NASPA Advisory Board is set to vote on Thursday to officially remove the offensive terms from its vocabulary. This decision could take additional time to implement, as the NASPA will need to carefully review the terms to ensure that they are indeed offensive.

This could open the door to better ways of diagnosing psychiatric conditions including depression, according to the lead author, Dr. Andres Herane-Vives. He also developed a new type of swab that won't damage the eardrum. Cortisol is known as your \"fight or flight\" hormone. It sends out alarm signals to the brain in response to stress and can influence almost every system in the body, from the immune system to digestion and sleep. However, its role in disorders including anxiety and depression is not fully understood. Dr. Herane-Vives wants to understand what raised or lowered levels of cortisol might indicate. It's early days, but he hopes this could eventually help him establish an \"objective biological measure\" for psychiatric conditions. In theory, people with mental health symptoms could have their levels of cortisol tested, and this could help to inform their diagnosis. Currently, mental health diagnosis is largely subjective, so this could provide","346":"#### Why Choose Us - 100% non-plagiarised papers - 24\/7 \/365 Service Available - Affordable Prices - Why Choose Us - 100% non-plagiarised papers - 100% non-plagiarised papers - 24\/7 \/365 Service Available - Affordable Prices","347":"Britain\u2019s Sajid Javid has admitted frictionless trade with the EU will be \u201cover\u201d but said Britain would have a \u201cbetter future\u201d.

The article focuses on the performance of Robert Redford, who is the only cast member in the film. Redford's character, known as Our Man, faces high seas and violent storms with an almost silent stoicism. The film's only real spoken lines come in a voiceover at the start when Redford's character reads out a valedictory letter to his family and friends. Chandor made his name with 2011's talky financial crisis drama Margin Call, a debut feature that earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. Chandor was inspired to write the film's opening letter on a train journey along the US coast, while he was hard at work editing Margin Call. Chandor had the idea of casting Redford for All is Lost while at Redford's annual Sundance Film Festival in Utah. During Redford's welcoming speech, a technical hitch meant that a speaker close to Chandor stopped working and robbed the actor of his voice.","412":"Election chief in India says he opposes death penalty for rape convicts and wants change in law if he wins power, says party chief in Uttar Pradesh rally, criticised by media and websites.&nbsp;...&nbsp;&nbsp;","413":"Ms McCullough's mother and she was told to \"stop being so dramatic\" and that he would pay for it if she did not pay for the dinners and drinks she was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks,\" said Ms McCullough. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying for the dinners and drinks I was having. \"I was worried about who was paying","414":"A Grade I listed building in Halifax has been reopened after a \u00a327m refurbishment project, which is due to be completed in the spring of next year, has been completed by a council..&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&","415":"A new study from the University of California Davis has found that the average risk for autism is 18% not 3-10% as estimated before. 2.

The earthquake, which was measured at 7.5 on the Richter scale, caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure in the city. The tsunami waves that followed reached up to 3 meters high, causing further damage and displacing thousands of people. The aftershocks continued to rock the city, making it difficult for rescue teams to access the affected areas. The government has responded quickly to the disaster, deploying relief aid and rescue teams to help the victims. However, the magnitude of the disaster is such that it is difficult to provide immediate assistance to everyone who needs it. The authorities are working hard to provide medical assistance and shelter to the survivors, but there is still a long way to go. The loss of life and property in this disaster is a reminder of the fragility of human life and the importance of being prepared for natural disasters. It is important for governments and communities to have disaster preparedness plans in place to minimize the impact of such events. This includes having evacuation plans, emergency shelters, and a coordinated response from emergency services.","419":"$2.49 per ticket - \u00a32.49 per person - \u00a37.49 - \u00a37.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49 - \u00a32.49","420":"Summary: The article highlights a touching story of a community coming together to help an elderly couple stuck in their sixth-floor apartment without a working elevator.

The microbe, Microsporidia MB, was discovered by studying mosquitoes on the shores of Lake Victoria in Kenya. The researchers found that mosquitoes carrying the microbe were not harbouring the malaria parasite, and lab experiments confirmed that the microbe gave the mosquitoes protection against malaria. The discovery is significant because malaria is a deadly disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, most of them children under the age of five. While progress has been made through the use of bed nets and spraying homes with insecticide, this has stalled in recent years. The article states that new tools are needed to tackle malaria, and this discovery could be a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly disease. The article does not provide any specific information on how the microbe blocks malaria, but it states that the researchers are investigating whether they can release infected mosquitoes into the wild, or use spores to suppress the disease.

The robot's wings are powered by a special substance called piezoelectric material, which contracts when voltage is applied to it. By rapidly switching the voltage on and off, the scientists were able to make this material behave like the tiny muscles that make a fly's wings beat so fast. The main goal of this research was to understand how insect flight works, rather than to build a useful robot. However, the researchers envisioned that the robots could be used for search-and-rescue operations to search for human survivors under collapsed buildings or in other hazardous environments, as well as for environmental monitoring and assisting with pollination.","467":"Harland and Wolff, a shipbuilding company in Belfast, has expressed interest in the project, saying it could bring its \"commercial edge\" to the plans.
