## 🔬 Research Overview

This repository presents **CLSA (Cross-Lingual Summarization Attack)**, a novel black-box attack against LLM watermarking schemes that combines the effects of translation and summarization to evade detection. Unlike existing translation-based attacks, CLSA simultaneously compresses and translates watermarked text, creating a dual disruption to watermark signals.

### 🚨 Key Findings

- **Effective Evasion**: CLSA pushes detection AUROC toward chance levels (≈0.5) across multiple watermarking schemes
- **Cross-Language Impact**: Attack effectiveness persists across high-resource (English→Chinese, English→Spanish) and lower-resource languages
- **Practical Threat**: Collapses true positive rates at 1% false positive rate to near-zero levels
- **Quality Preservation**: Maintains reasonable summary quality while degrading detectability

## 🧪 What CLSA Does

**Problem**: Current LLM watermarking schemes embed detectable patterns in generated text, but these signals can be disrupted by various text transformations.

**Our Approach**: CLSA leverages cross-lingual summarization models (mT5, mBART) to:
1. Take a watermarked English summary as input
2. Generate a compressed summary in a target language (Chinese, Spanish, etc.)
3. Optionally translate back to English for detection analysis
4. Significantly reduce watermark detectability while preserving semantic content

**Why It Works**: The dual effect of compression (reducing text length) and translation (changing linguistic patterns) disrupts the "green-list" token bias and semantic clustering that watermarking algorithms rely on for detection.

## 🔍 Experimental Setup

### Watermarking Schemes Tested
- **KGW**: Green-list watermarking with vocabulary partitioning
- **SIR**: Semantic-Invariant Robust watermarking
- **XSIR**: Cross-lingual extension of SIR
- **Unigram**: Unbiased watermarking variant

### Models and Datasets
- **Summarization Models**: mT5-multilingual-XLSum, mBART-50
- **Translation Models**: M2M100 for cross-lingual evaluation
- **Datasets**: XL-Sum (44 languages), CrossSum (1,500+ language pairs)
- **Hardware**: Single RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM), 64GB RAM, ~3 days runtime

### Attack Scenarios
1. **Direct CLS**: English watermarked text → Target language summary
2. **Round-trip CLS**: English → Target language → Back to English
3. **Baseline Comparisons**: Paraphrasing, translation-only attacks

## 📊 Detailed Results

### Detection Performance Degradation

| Detector | Language | Baseline AUROC | CLSA AUROC | Performance Drop |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------|------------------|
| KGW | English→Chinese | 0.892 | 0.523 | -41.4% |
| KGW | English→Spanish | 0.892 | 0.507 | -43.2% |
| SIR | English→Chinese | 0.835 | 0.548 | -34.4% |
| XSIR | English→Chinese | 0.798 | 0.592 | -25.8% |

### Additional Metrics

![Equal Error Rate](scripts/plots/eer_table.png)

*Higher EER values under CLSA indicate reduced separability between watermarked and non-watermarked content.*

![AUPRC Results](scripts/plots/auprc_table.png)

*Area Under Precision-Recall Curve shows consistent degradation across all detector-language combinations.*

## 🛡️ Implications for Watermark Security

### Attack Effectiveness
- **Broad Impact**: Affects multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes
- **Cross-Lingual Vulnerability**: Exploits the multilingual nature of modern LLMs
- **Practical Feasibility**: Uses readily available summarization models without specialized training

### Defense Considerations
- **Ensemble Detection**: Combining detection scores across languages and translations provides partial mitigation
- **Robustness Gap**: Current watermarking schemes lack sufficient cross-lingual robustness
- **Quality-Security Tradeoff**: Stronger watermarks may impact text generation quality
