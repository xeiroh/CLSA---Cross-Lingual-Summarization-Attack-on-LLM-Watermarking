suicide. Mr Nicklinson wanted someone to actually kill him without being prosecuted. However, he lost his high court case last week around the same time that he started refusing food. The life he described as a \u201cliving nightmare\u201d came to an end on Wednesday. But even though he failed in the courts, it is possible that his case may change society\u2019s views on assisted suicide. Mr Nicklinson\u2019s case sparked a large amount of personal sympathy from many people who disagreed with his view. His despair was captured on film when the High Court decision was announced. The judges said that the courts could not decide if the law on assisted dying should change but that this is an issue for Parliament to decide. The British Medical Association does not want laws to change allowing doctors to legally end patient\u2019s lives. However, more cases will continue to come forward and there may be a debate on this topic in the future.","2":"1. The article highlights the history and significance of Radio Caroline, an illegal (or \"pirate\") radio station that was founded in 1964.\n2. The station broadcast from ships until 1991, when one of its vessels was shipwrecked off the Kent coast. The station has since continued to exist as an internet and digital service.\n3. After a successful application to Ofcom, Radio Caroline has been given the medium wave frequency of 648kHz, previously used by the BBC World Service to relay broadcasts to Eastern Europe. The frequency change will take effect from Friday, noon.\n4. The article notes that the BBC World Service frequency, previously used to relay broadcasts to Eastern Europe, is an \"ironic twist\" for the current iteration of Radio Caroline. The station was founded in 1964 as a pop music station, operating in a time when radio broadcasting was dominated by the BBC and pop music was played for only an hour a week.\n5. Radio Caroline is one of five stations granted a community radio license by Ofcom, awarded in June 2021. The award comes 50 years after the station was rendered an illegal (or \"pirate\") station under the 1967 Marine Broadcasting Offences Act.\n6. The current Radio Caroline is aimed at Suffolk and Essex, though test transmissions have reached further afield and can be received along much of the East Coast.","3":"There have been many repeated calls for a vaccination against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) to be offered to all boys as well as girls in the UK. However, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) only recommended the vaccine to gay and bisexual men, in addition to cervical cancer protection for girls. The recommendation was based on data about HPV-related cancers for men, as well as genital warts. The government has recently announced a pilot programme to extend the vaccine to gay and bisexual men up to the age of 45. The programme will be launched in England, while a similar one will be launched in Wales. However, some experts have criticized the decision as a cynical stalling tactic and have called for the vaccine to be offered to all adolescent boys.","4":"The move comes amid increased security concerns, particularly following the death of the Labour MP Jo Cox. Until now, MPs who wanted to install security had to apply through the parliamentary expenses watchdog Ipsa. But the BBC's Norman Smith said MPs had decided to strip the watchdog of its authority over security decisions amid concerns over delays to MPs' requests. Following a decision by the Estimates Committee of MPs on Tuesday, all MPs will automatically be offered extra security - such as panic buttons, extra lighting, additional locks and emergency fobs - and will not have to apply to have them installed. Previously, MPs wanting enhanced security arrangements had to have to a risk assessment carried out by the police and written estimates before any work could be carried out. Jo Cox died last month after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency, the first MP to be killed for more than 25 years. The safety of MPs outside the Houses of Parliament is the responsibility of local police forces but Ipsa has responsibility for approving funding for security procedures and dealing with requests from individual MPs. 'Providing assurance' The watchdog's chairman wrote to MPs in the aftermath of Ms Cox's death to say the way in which it handled applications would be \"reviewed and accelerated\" in response to concerns about its role. In January, the security measures available to MPs at their constituency offices and homes were \"standardised\" - to try to speed up the process and ensure all 650 members of the Commons receive a consistent service. They were divided into two packages: routine and enhanced claims. The former is based on MPs filling in self-assessment forms although MPs must obtain two separate quotes from locksmiths. Those seeking additional protection in response to a specific threat must consult local police commanders who are expected to make recommendations based on a security and intelligence review.

After the decision not to allow the ship to dock, Salvini declared that the boat was \u201cillegal\u201d, despite the ship rescuing more than 60 migrants and transporting them to Italian waters. The Spanish ship has rescued over 200 migrants and was forced to divert from their original destination of Sicily. Salvini, as well as Five Star, Italy\u2019s left-wing anti-establishment government party, have both been accused of breaching international law. Salvini, however, has argued against this accusation, declaring that his actions do not violate any humanitarian laws. Salvini declared that the Italian island of Lampedusa was \u201cclosed\u201d, demanding to know why the ship, Open Arms, had failed to divert from their original course of the Italian island of Sicily. Salvini also criticised the decision of the Italian Government to allow 27 migrants who were on board to disembark, accusing them of \u201cbreaking all sense of law and order\u201d.\nSalvini declared that, although he had allowed the ship to disembark, it would not be a regular occurrence, stating, \u201cEvacuation of unaccompanied minors completed.

The BPI is an organisation that is trying to show how the number of music consumers has increased, since it was found that in 2011, only 20% of music consumers preferred digital music downloads to CDs or Vinyl records.

She further says that the issue is not just that black women hold lower-paying jobs but they also earn less even in fields of technology, finance, entertainment, law, and medicine. She also says that even black women who have earned graduate degrees get paid less at every level. The article also talks about how the pay gap exists even in inner cities as well as in Silicon Valley.

Chief Constable Nick Gargan said in August custody suites, prisoner transport and identification services may be run by a private firm in future (2).

In a joint statement Mr Savage and Mr Levy said the chief constable's plan to privatise police custody suites \"has not been scrutinised or challenged by the current police and crime commissioner\" (3). Mr Levy said: \"The chief constable has described custody suites as 'support' services. In our view nothing could be further from the truth\" (4). \"It is a frontline service where the police service is at most risk and under most scrutiny if something goes wrong\" (5). The statement also said there was concern over \"the political closeness\" of Nick Gargan and Sue Mountstevens (6). \"Close working is essential for both jobs to work, but it must never be forgotten that the police and crime commissioner's job is to use her democratic mandate and express the public's concerns with policing and political decisions within the service\" (7). \"It's the chief constable's job to make operational decisions and it's the police commissioner's job to inform them politically and scrutinise the service\" (8). \"Not the other way around.\" In response Ms Mountstevens said \"I have been clear that I do not want to see core policing roles privatised. \"In January I will make a decision on either an in-house option or a business partnership model.\" She said the decision would be based on \"the evidence of the business cases taking into consideration the quality of service and value for money\", and would also include the views of the public and the police (9). She said she had visited two of the eight other forces that already use the private sector to \"deliver police custody support services\" (10). \"I cannot forget the savings required by central government and if the constabulary can find ways to work with partners to achieve the savings required then that is in my opinion the best option for the public.\"\n\nSummary:\nArticle:\nLabour's John Savage and","21":"A six-stone man who is 4ft 6in tall has experienced disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant.

They all used to be lush green, now it's all white desert,\" says Madhiben, who lives in a village in Gujarat in north-west India. Many parts of India are showing severe effects of desertification but now one social enterprise, Naireeta Services, is taking action. Co-founders Trupti Jain and Biplab Khetan Paul have come up with an answer to this. \"During the Gujarat earthquake of 2001, I remember how temperatures rose drastically leaving people without water, followed by monsoons, which flooded everything and left farms waterlogged for months. That's when I started looking for a solution\" says Biplab. \"Later I realised that these erratic rains could be a solution for such dry seasons.\" Biplab and Trupti then started experimenting with different structures to store excess rain water so that it could be used in dry seasons. That's when we innovated bhungroo - a water harvesting technique that uses an injection module to store excess rain water underground. Farmers can then use the same water for irrigation during summer and winter,\" says Trupti. Encroaching deserts The high level of salinity in many regions of Gujarat and other states of India often creates an impermeable white or brown layer that prevents water from penetrating the soil, leaving the surface waterlogged. This standing water adds to the salinity as many minerals present in the soil also get dissolved in the water, which in the dry season creates a salty layer,\" says Biplab. Each year, 12 million hectares (29 million acres) of land are lost to encroaching deserts. That's land where 20 million tonnes of grain could have been grown. People living off the land often feel they have no choice but to migrate. After migrating, many families find they have to work longer hours for less money, or they are exposed to dangerous working conditions. \"Many feel that they have no choice but to","28":"Key Point # 1: The report is the work of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The painting, titled \u201cThe Morning Walk\u201d, was slashed with a drill bit by Mr. Gregory on 18 March 2023. The incident occurred at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, where the painting is on display. Mr. Gregory, of no fixed address, absconded from a psychiatric hospital months before the incident and was found to be guilty because he knew what he was doing was wrong, according to prosecutors. The jury at the Southwark Crown Court is hearing the case, and Mr. Gregory has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Mr. Nicholas Dunham, representing Mr. Gregory, stated that his client has been diagnosed with a mental illness, most likely paranoid schizophrenia. Mr. Gregory claims that while standing at the National Gallery, he heard a voice telling him to \u201cput a mark on the painting, and your family will find you.\u201d He also reportedly made statements to security guards, such as claiming to have just been released from prison and that he could trigger a bomb. Mr. Gregory further boasted to witnesses that his father owned Queens Park Rangers football club and that his family could pay for the damages. According to Nicholas Dunham, Mr. Gregory has the belief that someone will kill him and make it look like a suicide. Mr. Gregory was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in October 2016 but absconded, subsequently sleeping rough for several months before the incident. The painting, dating back to 1785, took the National Gallery 80 hours to restore due to the slash marks made by Mr. Gregory. The restoration experts could not completely hide the marks, hence lowering the value of the painting, according to Larry Keith, an employee at the National Gallery. The trial is ongoing, and Mr. Gregory\u2019s mental state will be a key focus as the jury determines whether he is guilty or not.","31":"Only this week, the British Medical Association said doctors working on the front lines were \u201cscared\u201d and were left to make difficult decisions about whether to risk their lives by treating patients due to a lack of protective equipment (PPE).

This discrepancy has raised concerns that the pension fund could be heading for trouble, and that tuition fees for students could rise as a result.

The fund has also faced criticism for not taking sufficient action to address the deficit, such as increasing contributions or reducing benefits. The government has also been accused of not taking sufficient action to address the issue, as the pension fund is not subject to the same rules as private sector schemes and is not required to disclose information about its deficit. The government has indicated that it would not be willing to bail out the pension fund if it were to face financial difficulties. The University and Colleges Union, which represents the majority of the pension fund's members, has called on the government and the pension fund's trustees to take urgent action to address the deficit and ensure the pension fund remains secure.

The agency has long been planning to cut its workforce by about 1,550 but has decided to hold off until the current flooding situation has improved. Labour has claimed that the jobs of 550 flooding specialists are at risk from the shakeup but the agency has said that this is not currently being considered. The agency has been criticized for its performance in recent weeks and for its past policy on river dredging in Somerset, one of the worst-affected areas. However, its chairman Lord Smith has praised the dedication and professionalism of its frontline staff, many of whom have been working nonstop since the start of December. The agency has an annual budget of \u00a31.2bn and announced last year that it would reduce staff numbers from 11,250 to about 9,700 in response to a cut in the amount of money it gets from central government. The agency has never specified which departments would be affected and has postponed a consultation on potential redundancies until the current crisis is over. The agency's programme director Toby Willison said that they are prioritising incident response above all other work and will not be entering a formal consultation with staff until the current flooding has subsided. Once the agency moves out of incident response mode, it will refocus its efforts to continue to bring Environment Agency costs in line with its budget from government for 2014-15. The agency has postponed job cuts in light of the current flooding crisis.","42":"Paul Rincon is the science editor for the BBC News Website and has written a \n  article regarding the project of the European and American collaborators in developing a more intense neutrino stream from Fermilab in Illinois. The project is called DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment). This project will involve the development of the world's most high intensity neutrino stream. The stream of neutrinos will travel 800 miles underground from Fermilab toward a massive detector based in South Dakota. The collaboration is called DUNE and it was formed earlier this year. Among the goals of the project will be to capture neutrino streams coming from a distant supernova. The collaboration is the product of the merging of European and American projects. The meeting that was held at Fermilab in April, 2015, had 700 signatures. The collaboration will involve a new name and commitments from the US, Europe, India, and other regions to go forward with the project. Neutrinos are elementary cosmic building blocks and are nicknamed ghost particles. The property that makes neutrinos so difficult to observe is that they are light and have no electric charge, so they pass harmlessly through other matter. Neutrinos may play a role in the mysterious fact that the universe consists mostly of matter and only 15% of antimatter. The DUNE project will make use of an existing particle accelerator located at Fermilab in Illinois.","43":"Roman Polanski, the famous French-Polish director, has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.

The men sent messages mocking their victims, Leicester Crown Court heard. Leicestershire County Council said it was \"despicable fraud perpetrated across the country\".\n\nThree men were jailed while four men were given suspended sentences.

But the company - led by Russell Canfield and Liam Cuffe - continued to trade with the same staff under the name Prestige Property Solutions.\n\nBoth firms were based in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire. Prosecutor Adam Pearson said the seven men would, after advertising OAP discounts, charge \"often infirm\" customers up to 10 times the correct amount for simple plumbing jobs. He said during the 15-month investigation, more than 150 complaints were made and their turnover would have \"exceeded \u00a31m\".\n\nA search warrant was executed on Prestige Property Solutions in August 2017.

The fire at the 24-story tower in west London claimed 72 lives in June 2017. The inquiry, now in its second phase, is looking into how the building came to be covered in such cladding during a refurbishment from 2012 to 2016. Mr. Sounes was in charge of the day-to-day management of the refurbishment project for the tower. On the second day of hearings, Mr. Sounes was questioned about his knowledge of building regulations and associated guidance. Mr. Sounes was unable to explain how the new cladding system selected for Grenfell met the government's guidance for fire safety in tall buildings, despite accepting that fire safety was \"fundamental to the work of an architect's practice\". Mr. Sounes said he was familiar with the broad regulation that a building should not be able to spread fire on the outside. However, he \"did not recall hearing of\" the specific guidance that materials must be of limited combustibility when used above 18 meters (59 feet). Inquiry barrister Kate Grange asked him: \"You didn't apply your mind at the time of the Grenfell project to how this clause applied to the materials that you were selecting?\" He responded: \"As I wasn't myself preparing the documents - I did not, no.\" Later the inquiry was shown the specifications for the project - which Mr. Sounes had prepared - and he was asked why he had not checked the products he had chosen complied with regulations. \"We asked for advice,\" he said, \"but it wasn't for us to... satisfy ourselves because I don't think that was within our ability.\" The inquiry had already heard that Studio E had no experience of working on tall buildings. And in Tuesday's evidence, it heard that the architects had tried to keep the budget for the project below the set budget.","52":"In the article, it states that Google has purchased the YouTube website in 2006 for $1.65 billion (\u00a31.03 billion) and has since been exercising greater control over the popular site.

Demonstrators say government plans for a census are a ploy to delay elections. Mr Kabila is constitutionally barred from running for a third term. The government admits next year's elections could be delayed, but says the census is vital to ensure free and fair elections. 'Looters killed' The BBC's Maud Jullien reports from Kinshasa that most shops are closed and internet and text messaging services have been blocked, apparently on the orders of the government. Hundreds of angry young men burned tyres in several neighbourhoods, looted mainly Asian-owned shops and threw stones at cars, our reporter says. A town hall in southern Kinshasa, a city with a population of more than nine million, was also set ablaze, AFP news agency reports. In the poor area of Masina on the city's outskirts, police tried to disperse protesters by shooting into the air, our correspondent says. Ten people were arrested on Tuesday, AFP reports. Government spokesman Lambert Mende said two policemen and two \"looters\" had been killed in Monday's clashes in the capital. Human rights activists said up to 10 people may have been killed. Opposition figures suggested the number of those who had died may be higher still. Boycott The demonstrators called on Mr Kabila to step down when his term expires and carried placards which said: \"Don't touch the constitution\". Hundreds of people also protested on Monday in Goma, the main trading post in the east. The protests coincided with a debate in the Senate, the upper parliamentary chamber, over government plans to hold a census before elections. Most senators, including members of the governing party, said they were opposed to the plan because it risked destabilising the country. The lower chamber, the House of Representatives, approved the plan on Saturday, in a vote boycotted by opposition parties. They argue that the census would give Mr Kabila, whose term expires in December, more time in office.

China\u2019s history of industrial accidents China\u2019s land and resources ministry said in a statement on its website that initial investigations showed the landslide happened when a huge mound of soil, cement chunks and other construction waste became unstable. \u201cBecause the mound was very large, and the angle of its slope was overly steep, this led to it losing stability and collapsing,\u201d it said. People\u2019s Daily said the mound had accumulated at a stone quarry that had been converted into a dumping area with its entrance and exit facing an industrial district. Residents evacuated from the surrounding area described hearing loud roars when the landslide happened. Amateur footage of the incident broadcast on state television showed waves of red soil quickly engulfing and crushing buildings. A video taken by an eyewitness and posted online by Beijing Daily newspaper shows plumes of soil shooting up in the air as the mound of earth collapses.

Antoinette Sandbach believes a lack of free parking in the town means businesses could suffer. Flintshire council said it had a good \"working relationship with Mold Town Council in addressing parking issues\". Before the five council wardens were introduced, parking offences were enforced by police. Conservative AM Ms Sandbach claims figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show more than \u00a322,000 has been raised so far, with 351 penalty notices still unpaid. Of the 995 tickets issued, 613 were in Mold, followed by 145 in Flint, 83 in Buckley, 66 for Shotton and 32 in Holywell. Of the fines, 800 were for illegal parking on the street. Ms Sandbach said: \"It is interesting that Mold is one of the few places in Flintshire that charges for parking. \"Small traders - who are competing against large shopping centres with free parking - consistently tell me that parking is an issue for their customers. \"I quite appreciate that certain locations and especially disabled parking bays, need to be kept clear to ensure traffic can flow easily, but if people are parking illegally to avoid car park charges, that can not be good for shops and businesses in our town centres.\" She added: \"I'd ask Flintshire councillors to look again at their parking policies for Mold. \"Anything that deters trade is a serious issue in today's economic climate.\" Flintshire's five civil parking enforcement officers issued the notices between 1 October and the first week in December. Councillor Bernie Attridge, cabinet member for environment, said there had been \"a noticeable improvement in general levels of traffic congestion and highway obstructions\" since the wardens were introduced. He added: \"We also have a very positive and constructive working relationship with Mold Town Council in addressing parking issues within the town. \"Indeed, the town council worked jointly with the county council to establish a free parking pilot in the town centre in September. The trial scheme saw free parking in all council car parks between 2pm and 6pm on weekdays, and all day on Saturdays.","69":"In the village of Burton Green, some villagers are packing up and leaving, while others are still waiting for the house-sale to be possible.

The company said it was going through a \"natural down-manning process\" as it approaches the end of work on the Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm project. It has also warned that redundancies may affect the permanent staff. The Scottish government has said that it has been \"fully focused and working intensively\" to secure the long-term future of the company. Unite, a trade union, has urged the Scottish government to intervene to help BiFab and save the jobs of the 260 employees. The company has said that it has already notified the Scottish government, public agencies, and its workforce about the potential planned redundancies, but no decisions have been taken yet. Bob McGregor, the regional officer of Unite, has said that the Scottish government's intervention last year to create a lifeline for these yards was \"absolutely pivotal.\" He added that the same scale of intervention is required now, led by the Scottish government, to save these jobs and create a viable renewables industry in Scotland. Alan Ritchie, the GMB Scotland organiser, has said that the battle for BiFab will continue and that they have a crunch meeting with the Scottish government next week. The company said that it would only have a better understanding about new investment coming into the yards and the long-term future after that meeting.","71":"The H5N8 bird flu strain has been found in poultry and wild birds in 14 countries including Germany and France. The government's chief vet Prof Nigel Gibbens said the risk to humans was low and no UK cases had been found. The precautionary measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) apply to farmers and anyone in England who keeps any birds, even those with a few chickens in their back garden. Similar restrictions have been introduced in Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland. Farmers are being asked to look for signs of infection and to take robust disinfectant measures. Members of the public are also being told to report cases of dead wild waterfowl - such as swans, geese and ducks - or gulls, or five or more dead birds of other species to Defra. Defra said it had increased its surveillance, and keepers are being urged to make sure feed and water is not accessible to wild birds. Daniel Brown, a chicken farmer from Cambridge with 40,000 hens in three sheds, said Defra had made the correct decision. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We'll be shutting them in this morning. We'll be putting in extra toys for the birds - straw bales, empty bottles, cardboard boxes - anything to give them something else to think about. They love going outside, and now they can't for their own safety so we'll be doing anything we can just to keep the birds happy.\" Prof Gibbens said: \"We are closely monitoring the situation across Europe and have scaled up surveillance in response to the heightened risk. \"As a precaution, and to allow time for poultry and captive bird keepers to put in place appropriate biosecurity measures, we have declared a 30-day prevention zone to reduce the risk of infection from wild birds.\" Prof Gibbens said the disease can get into housed birds and urged farmers to increase and maintain strict biosecurity measures.","72":"BBC reports that Ms Thunberg is sailing from the UK to attend UN climate summits in New York and Chile and that she chooses not to fly.

Spittal Hill Wind Farm Ltd was owned by Statkraft, a Norwegian firm. They planned to construct up to 30 turbines in Caithness. However, Energy Minister Fergus Ewing refused their application in June last year, citing concerns about noise and visual impact.\n2. Following this setback, Statkraft proposed a scaled-down project involving eight turbines on the same site. They argued the project would bring economic, social, and environmental benefits to the area. However, Highland Council opposed the scheme.\n3. The original project received 1,546 letters of objection and 1,268 letters of support. Mr. Ewing said it would have had a negative impact on nearby properties and views of the landscape. Noise from the turbines could potentially have been heard from residents in 89 properties within 1.2 miles of the site.\n4.

Three small base stations have been put on the roofs of the pub, the school and the doctors' surgery. It is the result of months of campaigning by Graham Powell, a local county councillor. \"In terms of mobile phone coverage, it's a case of the haves and the have-nots,\" said Mr Powell. \"And the divide between the two is increasingly growing. \"We have to bridge that gap and anything we can do is worthwhile.\" Mr Powell said he entered local politics because he wanted to improve the phone and broadband coverage in the rural area. A former telecommunications worker, he took on the job of getting the people of Ewyas Harold behind the idea, which led to the village becoming one of 12 picked from hundreds to take part in the trial run by Vodafone. He cites emergencies as an important reason for having network coverage, adding: \"I'd hate for someone to have an accident and not be able to call for help.\" However, possibly the greatest impact will be on the village's children. Teenagers and mobile phones usually go hand in hand - but until now, not in Ewyas Harold. Louis Eastwood and Rachel Mailes, both 15, and 16-year-old Tash Bagley, own mobile phones but can only use them when they leave the village and pick up a signal. \"For me, getting the proper signal when it's all switched on, is 10 out of 10 in importance,\" said Tash. \"If I can't contact my friends I feel like they can make plans without me.\" \"I'd be so happy if the signal works and make up for lost time and just text loads and loads,\" said Louis. \"We're OK really, because we get a signal in school. But for people who work and live [in Ewyas Harold] it must be a nightmare,\" he added. For many people, life without a mobile phone signal can be traumatic.

The Church of Scotland said the final sum for each of the properties was above the asking price. A number of other churches are under offer. The plan is to close 20 churches in Shetland as part of the Church's plan to reduce the number of churches it maintains throughout Scotland. The closures are necessary due to national and local financial pressures, according to the Church. The aim of closing the buildings is to ensure a more sustainable future for the decreasing congregations in the isles. The money raised from the sales will ensure the upkeep of those churches that will remain open. The proceeds will be used to make those churches \"up to date\" and a \"centre for the community.\" It is hoped that the money will be used to provide wi-fi in all of the buildings to enable them to stream services. The redesign of the Church of Scotland in Shetland took place earlier this year, and it became part of the new presbytery. The presbytery merger aims to reduce costs while increasing ministry and service, according to the Church.","92":"Summary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\n\nFurther Reading:\nSummary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\nFurther Reading:\nSummary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\nFurther Reading:\nSummary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\nFurther Reading:\nSummary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\nFurther Reading:\nSummary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\nFurther Reading:\nSummary of the article\n\nOnline resources to review:\nFurther Reading:","93":"\u2022 The superhero Captain Britain has been around since the 1970s and has recently been the subject of a potential television series.\n\u2022 The character was created by British writers Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe for Marvel UK as a British counterpart to Captain America.\n\u2022 Alan Moore, a well-known British comic book writer, wrote for the series during the 1980s.\n\u2022 The television series has not yet been produced but discussions are underway, although it is not certain whether it will go ahead.\n\u2022 The Captain Britain series is set in England and includes characters and locations that are specific to the UK.","94":"The European Space Agency has signed a contract with a joint German-Italian firm to run the day-to-day operations of the Galileo satellite navigation project. SpaceOpal will run the system from two Galileo Control Centres in Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich, and Fucino, near Rome.

Galileo should have been operational by now but the project has run into myriad technical, commercial and political obstacles, including early objections from the US, who thought a rival system to GPS might be used to attack its armed forces. The venture came very close to being abandoned in 2007 when the public-private partnership put in place to build and run the project collapsed.

The station will now open in spring 2015, rather than December, as was originally planned, according to a statement from the county council. Councillor Andy Botham expressed disappointment. Additional flood control measures were required, according to the county council. The delay will be frustrating to everyone involved in the project, according to a statement from the county council.

The mountain is currently owned by the Earl of Lonsdale and is being put up for sale to settle an inheritance tax bill. The mountain has been described as \"the people's peak\" by some, as it has been a significant landmark for many people in the region. The Friends of Blencathra organisation has already established itself as a charity and has begun raising funds to purchase the mountain. The Earl has expressed some concerns about future owners not being as good custodians of the mountain as the current owners. The National Trust has also stated that they are not planning on making a bid for the mountain, as they feel that the mountain's existing protection and public access are already sufficient. However, Ms Cosgrove, who is leading the bid to purchase the mountain on behalf of the Friends of Blencathra organisation, has expressed a desire to promote a positive agenda of social responsibility through public ownership of the mountain. The organisation has already spoken to local charities and is exploring ideas such as volunteering and history tours to promote this agenda.","124":"Caps on class sizes\nA policy for lowering class sizes to 25 pupils was announced by the Welsh Liberal Democrats on Thursday. They said more than 70,000 pupils in Wales were taught in classes of over 25, or 59% of all infant classes. Education spokesman Aled Roberts AM said teachers would have more time with individual children and lesson quality would improve. The Liberal Democrats said it was about giving teachers \"time to do what they do best: teach\", adding that classes can have up to 30 pupils. Mr Roberts said it was a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment for the 2021 Welsh assembly elections, as part of a package of proposals aimed at improving attainment. Welsh Labour has said it would not support the move. The National Union of Teachers Cymru hoped the policy would lead to a \"wider debate\" about class sizes ahead of next year's assembly elections.

I feel a real responsibility to look after our mother's legacy, I'm very committed to that, but we were just too deep in debt. \"I am devastated that this has happened. I was 11 when my mother opened her first restaurant and I would go there after school, it was a big part of my life.\" Mrs Home said what her mother had achieved with the business had been \"amazing\" and she had helped make people more aware of what they were eating and why it was important. She added: \"I really wanted to keep my mother's legacy going, I feel so sad that I have not been able to.\" From farm shop to basement restaurant It was in the 1930s that Janet Henderson became very aware that diet was so important, after being introduced to vegetarianism by an aunt in Vienna.

Theresa May has pledged that almost a decade of budget cuts, pay restraint, and benefit freezes is nearing an end. Labour says an additional \u00a330bn is needed by 2023, in addition to the \u00a320bn promised for the NHS, to make this a reality. Recent figures showing government borrowing in September was at its lowest level since 2007 has, economists say, given the chancellor greater room for maneuver in Monday\u2019s statement. In her Tory conference speech earlier this month, the prime minister signaled the improving state of the public finances could see increased support for public services in next year\u2019s spending review. People needed to know the sacrifices they had made since 2010 had paid off, she said. Ministers have already promised the health service an additional \u00a320bn by 2023. Mr. McDonnell told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cIf the prime minister has promised to end austerity, let\u2019s have an honest debate about that.\u201d In a speech on Thursday, the shadow chancellor said the NHS and other public services need help now if Mrs. May is to be \u201ctrue to her word\u201d. He claimed Mrs. May had \u201csurprised\u201d Mr. Hammond with her party conference announcement after pressure to reverse spending cuts from Labour and her own backbenchers. \u201cWith a bit of chutzpah, which I quite admire, Mrs May threw the architect of austerity, the man who back in the days when the Tories were in opposition designed the austerity program, she threw him under the proverbial bus with her unilateral announcement of the end of austerity.\u201d Stopping departmental spending cuts planned for next year will cost \u00a34bn, Labour says, while shelving further budget cuts for the period up to 2023 would cost another \u00a315bn. Abandoning welfare cuts planned over the next four years would cost \u00a37bn while another \u00a31.5bn would need to be found to plug the gap in social care funding by 2023.","127":"An election has been proposed for the UK on 14 October, 2019, but the date coincides with the beginning of the Jewish festival of Succot, which falls on the 15th of October.

The article highlights that Germany's Corona-Warn-App has been installed by around 16 million people, but the effectiveness of the app is not yet known. The article points out that the privacy-conscious design of the app makes it difficult to determine its effectiveness. The article also highlights that the UK government has abandoned a centralised NHS contact-tracing app and switched to a decentralised version, which is based on the Apple-Google toolkit. The article stresses that the UK government has acknowledged that no country in the world has a functioning contact-tracing app, despite the claims of the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Keir Starmer. The article concludes that while contact-tracing apps have the potential to be effective in fighting the spread of the coronavirus, their effectiveness can be difficult to determine due to privacy concerns.

The crossings are expected to pass into public ownership from 2018, with some calling for the tolls to be cut. But Prof Stuart Cole said there was little to support claims that charges deterred inward investment or tourists. Motorists only pay to enter Wales across the two bridges while travelling eastbound from Wales into England is free. The tolls for vans and minibuses rose 30p on New Year's Day to \u00a312.40 while tolls for lorries and coaches rose 50p to \u00a318.60. Operated by private company Severn River Crossings Plc, the two bridges are used by about 80,000 vehicles every day. The company's concession will end when takings from the tolls reach \u00a3996m at 1989 prices, predicted to happen in 2018. First Minister Carwyn Jones has called for control of the bridges to be transferred to the Welsh government in at that time. A report commissioned by the Welsh government in November said businesses and consumers spend \u00a380m a year crossing the Severn bridges. It said abolishing the tolls would increase traffic by an estimated 11,000 vehicles a day and could boost south Wales' economic output. A Welsh government spokesman has previously said: \"The UK government control the level of tolls on the Severn crossings, and it is a matter for them to justify this increase to the people of Wales.\" However, Prof Cole, professor of transport at the University of Glamorgan, told BBC Wales: \"The question is, when the [Severn] bridge is transferred in 2018 to the public sector, will it stay with the Department of Transport or will it be transferred to the Welsh government? \"If it comes to the Welsh government, then it has an option of either using it as a revenue generator to pay for other schemes like electrification of the main [railway] line, the new M4 and other schemes, or it can reduce the toll. \"And there isn't enough evidence at the moment to suggest that people are dissuaded  from","152":"The text is about Lepe Country Park closing its gates by 20:00, particularly during the summer months.

Footage showed Joao Alberto Silveira Freitas, 40, being repeatedly punched in the face by the guards at a Carrefour store in Porto Alegre. One of the guards, it has emerged, was an off-duty military police officer. They were arrested, and the Brazilian subsidiary of the French supermarket group Carrefour said it had cut ties with the security firm that provided the guards. Brazil has a long legacy of racism. It was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888. Brazilians have traditionally been taught that they live in a racial democracy \u2013 President Jair Bolsonaro denies racism exists \u2013 but activists say that perception is slowly changing. Video of Thursday night\u2019s attack in the southern city of Porto Alegre was circulated on social networks and on Brazilian media \u2013 sparking outrage. It showed Mr Silveira Freitas, a welder, being repeatedly punched in the face and head by one security guard while being restrained by another. Another employee appeared to be alongside filming the incident. Reports said security had been called after a female worker at the supermarket had been threatened by a man. On Friday morning, protesters gathered outside the Carrefour in Porto Alegre and in the capital Brasilia, chanting and carrying signs which read \u201cAshamed of being white\u201d and \u201cPlease stop killing us\u201d. Protests were being called for in other cities. The Black Lives Matter movement, which has gained momentum worldwide since the killing of George Floyd in the US in May, has resonated with many Brazilians. In 2019, police in Brazil killed nearly six times as many people as in the US and most of them were black. Many took to social media to condemn Thursday\u2019s killing, including Brazil international footballer Richarlison Andrade. \u201cIt seems that we have no way out\u2026 not even on Black Consciousness day,\u201d the Everton player tweeted. \u201cIn fact, what conscience","155":"The article discusses the Cromwell army's crossing of the River Severn to participate in the Battle of Worcester in 1651, where a new play park, including mounds representing boats and wooden pikes and cannons, has been built to commemorate the event.

Del Rio was originally given 30 years for her role in an attack on the Guardia Civil police in Madrid which left 14 dead and 40 injured, but the remission rules were changed in 2006. The Strasbourg court said Spain must \"ensure the applicant's release at the earliest possible date\". Madrid has three months to request that the case be transferred to the European Court's Grand Chamber. The court said Spain had violated two articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in Del Rio's case: Article Seven (the right to no punishment without law) and Article Five (the right to liberty and security). Del Rio was arrested in Zaragoza in July 1988 while driving a car packed with explosives intended for an Eta attack on the Costa del Sol.","159":"Every hospital has its own way of measuring how well it\u2019s doing. The NHS is no different. Some of the measures are simple - how long a patient waited before being seen. Others are more complex - how well a patient felt they were treated. The government wants all these measures to be presented in a way everyone can understand - using standardised \u2018traffic light\u2019 ratings. The hospital can then show how they are performing - and how that has changed - using a simple red-amber-green system. For example, 98% of patients had to wait more than four hours in A&E in a particular hospital. That\u2019s an amber rating, because 2% of people waited longer than four hours for treatment. At another hospital, 25% of people had to wait more than four hours in A&E - a red rating. The government says this is because 25% of patients were waiting for more than four hours - rather than the more usual 2%. But some hospitals are so worried they have started using their own ratings systems. That\u2019s despite the government saying the traffic light system is only for guidance. The ratings are used to inform the government how well each hospital is performing. They are then used to set targets, which hospitals are expected to achieve. The government says it\u2019s working to make the traffic light system more reliable - and it\u2019s aiming to produce a more robust system by 2020. But some hospitals are already using their own ratings systems. That\u2019s despite the government saying the traffic light system is only for guidance.","160":"#### Top Answer\n\nArticle Summary: A group of academics and business...

Since the show began in 1985, east London has taken off, with Shoreditch and Hackney now attracting \"hipsters\", art students and technology companies. The BBC recently unveiled plans to build a new Albert Square, which will replicate the original but also be 20% bigger so they can open up new locations to film in.\n-Treadwell-Collins said that the show should feel more like London. It's been frozen in aspic for too long.\"\n-Terraced houses on Fassett Square, the area of Hackney used as the original inspiration for Albert Square, are now selling for as much as \u00a3700,000.\n\"Sharon [Letitia Dean] said recently that she's looking to be a landlady and as a result you'll see the edges of Shoreditch creeping into EastEnders. It's got to reflect the modern world,\" added Treadwell-Collins, who took over as executive producer in August last year. He added that he wanted to see the soap focus less on action and more on character, adding that it \"has to be about people and feelings and emotions\".\n-Treadwell-Collins said he was never a fan of blowing things up. Last week EastEnders was beaten by Coronation Street at the National Television Awards, following the ITV soap's emotional right-to-die storyline involving Hayley and Roy Cropper. A \"proper die-hard EastEnders fan\", Treadwell-Collins said he was happy to see the return of familiar faces, such as Lacey Turner playing Stacey Branning, as well as new characters.\n\"It's good to have one foot in the past while looking to the future.

The actor is 77 year old Robert Redford. Redford is an Oscar winning actor, director, producer, environmentalist, and philanthropist. All is Lost is only the second film in a decade that Redford has starred in as the lead character. The other is 2012's political drama The Candidate. The plot of the movie is about a solo yachtsman who finds himself in a life-threatening situation in the Indian Ocean. All is Lost is a very unconventional Hollywood film because its main character, an American businessman, is never named. The audience doesn\u2019t even know his name. The man only goes by the name Our Man. All the dialogue that is said by the man is part of a letter he reads to his family as a goodbye. Most of the movie is about Redford silently struggling to stay alive at sea after his ship is destroyed by a storm. Robert Redford is the sole actor in the movie. The only time that the audience hears his voice is in the beginning of the movie. JC Chandor, director and writer of All is Lost, says that \"Redford has an innate ability to communicate complex emotional transitions non-verbally.\" Chandor made his directorial debut with 2011's talky financial crisis drama Margin Call, a film that was nominated for an Oscar. All is Lost is very different to Chandor's first film. All is Lost is also different to most other Hollywood films because of its plot and lack of dialogue.\n\nCritical Thinking:\n\nRobert Redford is one of the most well-known actors in Hollywood, so why hasn\u2019t he starred in a leading film role in over a decade?\n\nDiscussion:\n\nWhy is it uncommon for Hollywood films to be silent (no spoken dialogue) for the entire film or for the majority of the film?\n\nWhy might a film\u2019s director decide to make a film that is very unconventional?","163":"Anglo-Italian Carlo Palombo will be sentenced later.

The timing of the flooding could not have been worse, as it occurred at the height of the Christmas season. For David Mitchelmore, the landlord of the Colebrook Inn, the flooding was a particularly tough blow, as it meant he had to close down the pub for several weeks. The flooded pub had saturated cob walls that would need to be repaired, new floors laid, and the commercial kitchen professionally deep cleaned before it could be used again. Dehumidifiers were being used to remove the remaining water, and it was estimated that the pub would not reopen until at least January 25th. Residents who were affected by the flooding were also struggling, with some forced to move out of their homes and others choosing to stay at home to oversee the drying-out process. For some residents, the flooding had taken a heavy emotional toll, and many were finding it hard to get into the festive spirit.","166":"Magna Carta - Latin for Great Charter - was agreed at Runnymede in 1215 and sealed by King John after powerful barons had rebelled and captured London. Held up as the embodiment of freedom and equality, it is revered in the US and credited with justifying the resistance to the rule of George III and influencing the Declaration of Independence. In his inaugural address in 1941, President Franklin D Roosevelt said: \"The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history... It was written in Magna Carta.\" But Magna Carta's status isn't agreed upon by everyone. In his book, A History of Britain, the historian Simon Schama writes that Magna Carta is not the birth certificate of freedom but rather the death certificate of despotism. And Mark Juddery, author of Overrated: The 50 Most Overhyped Things in History, argues that the interpretation of the charter over the centuries as a call for freedom is not the reality of the original document. \"What Magna Carta now means is great, but it did not have such lofty ideals at all,\" he says. \"It was great if you were a nobleman because it gave you the right to land. They really didn't like paying rent. \"That was the main reason they formulated Magna Carta. It wasn't really a case of this feeling that there should be a lot more freedom and that everyone should be equal. \"There was nothing about King John's numerous acts of cruelty and murder.\" Indeed, the majority of the clauses in the original document were focused on rights relating to the barons. And of the 63 clauses, only three have not now been repealed or become obsolete. The most famous of these is: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled. Nor will we proceed with force against him. Except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land.

The bill was passed in the lower house of parliament, but the government could not secure the passage of a bill that would have given constitutional status to the ombudsman. The finance minister said it was a sad day for democracy. A number of MPs from Congress and its allies were not present during the voting, leading to speculation that the former may seek an explanation from the missing MPs. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the passage of the bill was a special moment in the life of the nation. The bill gives power to prosecute politicians and civil servants, though it defeats a separate bill giving constitutional status to the ombudsman, a key demand of the Congress party. Campaigner Anna Hazare has called the bill useless, but has ended his fast, though he threatens instead to launch a campaign of civil disobedience. The bill was passed in the lower house of parliament, though it still needs to be passed in the upper house to become law.","173":"An al Shabab spokesman has said that fighting is ongoing, however a government official has said that the attack is over and that all the militants have been killed.

The group has vowed to step up attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. On Saturday, a suicide car bomb exploded near the capital's Parliament building, killing at least four people. The BBC's Mohammed Moalimu, in Mogadishu, says President Mohamud was attending a function at the residence of the UN special envoy to Somalia, near the airport. A large contingent of the Somali military police was accompanying him, leaving the presidential palace, known as Villa Somalia, mainly under the protection of African Union soldiers.

The article also states that Nokia had previously sold their mapping services to Microsoft, as part of their devices and services division, however they decided to purchase the mapping services as part of the deal. The article mentions that Nokia has created a mapping application specially for Samsung\u2019s Gear S wrist-worn gadget, called \u201cHere For Gear\u201d which is an optimized version for the device, as the screen is much smaller than regular phones. The article states that the mapping services can be used for offline navigation, as well as public transport details and tourist information. The article does acknowledge that Nokia Maps was not the only application Samsung has made a deal with, as they are also planning on making a deal with other companies, such as Facebook, as they do not want to rely on Google for their applications.

The article discusses the issue of diversity and how it is not fully represented in the theatre industry. The article cites the recent productions of Hamlet and King Lear that featured predominantly black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) casts. However, according to the article, there is still a significant lack of diversity in the theatre industry. The article mentions Paapa Essiedu, who is currently the Royal Shakespeare Company's Hamlet, stating that the industry is \"caught between two worlds at the moment.\" Essiedu suggests that while there is \"a lot of positivity about how we see our present and future,\" there still is not enough action to bring about change. The article mentions Manchester's Royal Exchange's King Lear, where veteran actor Don Warrington took the lead and it was a significant moment in history. However, many reviews drew attention to his race, which was an \"indictment of where we are.\" Warrington's statement indicates that while there has been improvement, there still is a significant lack of diversity in the theatre industry. The article mentions Hamida Ali, the acting union Equity's equalities and diversity organizer, sharing Warrington's unease, stating that \"there is definitely a consensus that there is a problem, but what the cause is, who is responsible, and what the solutions are is perhaps more in debate.\" Buffong, the artistic director of Talawa theatre company, states that the issue of diversity is still prevalent in the theatre industry despite the three decades of progress.

The researchers calculated that, of 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each who drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lifespan. The cancer harms of alcohol intake were that alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in women, as well as cancer risks of the gastrointestinal tract and liver in men. The overall picture of cancer risk is extremely complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions.

Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Mr Putin ordered the withdrawal of the main part of the Russian armed forces from Syria to begin on Wednesday. The Russian president said he considered the operation a success, having allowed the Syrian regime to retake 10,000sq km of territory from rebels in less than six months. Mr Putin made his comments as UN-sponsored peace talks began in Switzerland. The two-day meeting between representatives of Syrian government and rebels marks the first formal negotiations since the war began in March 2011. Russia is a key backer of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. \u201cI am ordering the defense ministry to begin the withdrawal of the main part of the armed forces from the Syrian Arab Republic,\u201d Mr Putin said at the Kremlin in Moscow. \u201cIt is necessary to immediately begin to work out a complete plan of their withdrawal to Russia, as well as of the rest of the armed forces of the Russian armed forces and of the contingent of the Russian aviation group,\u201d he added. Mr Putin said that Russia\u2019s Hmeimim air base in Latakia province and its Mediterranean naval base at Tartus would continue to operate as normal. The decision to scale down the Russian presence came after peace talks began in Switzerland. The two-day meeting between representatives of Syrian government and rebels marks the first formal negotiations since the war began in March 2011.

The researchers from the University of Edinburgh have found multiple skeletons of a previously unknown species called Oksoko avarsan. The feathered creatures date back to one hundred million years ago and had large toothless beaks. The discovery could help explain how animals lose fingers and toes through evolution. The species had one fewer finger on each forearm compared with its close relatives, suggesting an adaptability that enabled the animals to spread during the Late Cretaceous Period. Several complete skeletons of the feathered, omnivorous creatures were unearthed. The animals grew to two meters long and had a large toothless beak similar to that seen in parrots. It is the first evidence of digit loss in the three-fingered family of dinosaurs known as oviraptors. The team said the discovery that the dinosaurs could evolve forelimb adaptations suggested they could alter their diets and lifestyles, and potentially diversify and multiply. The team also discovered that Oksoko avarsan, like many other prehistoric species, were social as juveniles. The fossil remains of four young dinosaurs were preserved resting together. Dr. Gregory Funston, of the University of Edinburgh's School of Geosciences, said the discovery shed light on how a group of parrot-like animals thrived more than 68 million years ago. \"Oksoko avarsan is interesting because the skeletons are very complete, and the way they were preserved resting together showed that juveniles roamed together in groups. \"But more importantly, its two-fingered hand prompted us to look at the way the hand and forelimb changed throughout the evolution of oviraptors, which hadn't been studied before. \"This revealed some unexpected trends that are a key piece in the puzzle of why oviraptors were so diverse before the extinction that killed the dinosaurs.\" The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, was funded by The Royal Society and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council.","236":"Several Western countries imposed sanctions on China for human rights violations in Xinjiang autonomous region.

The researchers found that toddlers who spend more time using touchscreens sleep less at night and more during the day. Specifically, every hour spent using a touchscreen was linked to 15 minutes less sleep. However, it was also noted that toddlers who use touchscreen devices actively, such as by swiping rather than just watching, showed a more accelerated development of fine motor skills. The researchers suggest that parents should limit the amount of time spent in front of the TV as a guideline for the use of touchscreen devices, similar to screen time limits. However, it is important to note that the research is not definitive and that the science surrounding touchscreen use in early childhood is still developing.","239":"An article recently reported on an incident in London. A father killed his children in an attack. The father attacked 19-month-old Pavinya and three-year-old Nigish with a knife. The children's mother was in the shower at the time and was the person who alerted police. The father, 41-year-old Nadarajah Nithiyakumar, admitted two counts of manslaughter by diminished responsibility at the Old Bailey. Emergency services were called to the home in Aldborough Road North where they found both children injured. Pavinya was pronounced dead at the scene while Nigish was rushed to a hospital in Whitechapel where he later died. The 41-year-old admitted to police he had killed his son and daughter, explaining that he had been depressed and customers had \"upset him\" while he was working in a shop. The court heard the defendant had no previous history of violence and prosecutors felt it was \"appropriate to accept the plea of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility.\" The court sentenced the defendant, Mr. Nithiyakumar, to a medium secure mental health centre in east London where he has been treated.

In June, VW agreed a \u20ac1bn settlement in Germany over the emissions scandal, which came to light in 2015. Audi, whose ex-boss Rupert Stadler is being investigated over \"dieselgate\", said affected cars spanned 2004-18. Audi said in a statement that some V6 and V8 diesel engines were \u201cplaced on the market with an impermissible software function\u201d. Other engines implicated include the widely-used EA 288 and EA 189. In 2015, US investigators discovered that some VW diesel cars were fitted with what became known as \"defeat devices\" to flatter emissions readings during engine tests so that the true output of nitrogen oxides was reduced. The scandal spread throughout the motor industry, engulfing not just VW and its other car brands, but to other motor manufacturers. VW admitted in 2015 to putting defeat device software into 11 million cars worldwide. The company's total costs in fines, buybacks and refits has now reached \u20ac27bn. While the probe against Audi is now closed, other cases against executives from the VW group - including former chief executive Martin Winterkorn - remain open, with charges including fraud, false advertising and failure to keep investors informed. Earlier this month, VW ousted Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler. In June, he was put under investigation by German prosecutors over alleged fraud and false advertising involving the sale of cars with defeat devices, and remains in police custody. Audi's fine of \u20ac800m consists of \u20ac5m for regulatory rule-breaking, with the rest being payment for the economic benefits resulting from the sale of cars with defeat devices. Audi, VW group's most profitable brand, said the fine would hit its financial performance this year. VW share price initially fell on the news, but later rose more than 2% in Frankfurt. Analysis By Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent Just as its parent company did earlier this year, Audi has admitted to breaking environmental rules with a \u201cdefeat device\u201d.

The party has in the past warned its officials not to consume extravagant meals and buy mooncakes with public money. Since 2012, China has conducted a strict anti-corruption drive. The new rule governing golf states that members cannot obtain, hold, or use membership cards for gyms, clubs, golf clubs, or other various consumer cards, or enter private clubs. If they are discovered, members will be issued a warning or removed from the party. According to local media, 60 employees in state-owned businesses have been punished for spending public money on golf. The September dismissal of Lin Chunsong, a vice mayor in the south-eastern Fujian province, is an example. The new rules prohibit party members from abusing their positions for social interaction and from spending their funds on golf. According to a store owner who deals with golf equipment, sales have dropped by 30% since the party banned golf. Golf is about social interaction in China, according to Huang.

The Government's food waste awareness service, Wrap, found that 1.4 million bananas are thrown out every day for having minor bruises or black marks on their skin, which it says add up to \u00a380m in waste a year. Sainsbury's suggestions include using them to make banana bread or muffins.

The source, said Mr Can, had found out that the IS leader was about to move to a new location in Jarablus. The SDF have been key allies of the US in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group, but earlier this month Mr Trump pulled American troops out of northern Syria.

Park authority spokesman, Phil Bennett, said: \"The distinctive arrangement of prehistoric stones at Bedd Arthur stands within the Preseli Hills, which is also a Special Area of Conservation and it's very unfortunate that they have been defaced.\" \"The stone at Bedd Arthur had names scratched into it, whilst the 6ft plus Bedd Morris standing stone was hit by a vehicle and knocked over.\" Ranger Richard Vaughan added: \"A car was driven up an old trackway below the Iron Age fort of Carn Ffoi on Carn Ingli mountain and abandoned. \"The sump broke and a 200m black slick of oil contaminated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. \"The black BMW was a left on a bridleway, and is popular access route for locals and visitors alike. \"I've also had to clean up a popular parking site on Dinas mountain covered in empty bottles and smashed glass on the surrounding rocky area.\" A Cadw spokesperson said: \"Scheduled ancient monuments are legally protected, and damaging them is a criminal activity. \"These prehistoric sites have been here for thousands of years. \"Cadw will be working with the National Park Authority and site owners to make good the damage as much as possible, although damage to historic sites is in most cases, irreversible.\"","258":"1.

The location of the arrival point is central but insalubrious. The arrivals are mainly from the Middle East, with Yazidi people from Iraq among them. They have come through Serbia's eastern border with Bulgaria, rather than the classic route through Greece and Macedonia. In the centre, there are two floors. On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers. The upstairs \"safe space\" is operated by Save The Children, where bewildered-looking families gather. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room. In the meeting room, the manager explains that there are always people arriving in Belgrade, around 400-500 a day. The increasing restrictions on the Balkan route have not stopped people seeking a way to western Europe, but they have changed the means. The author's article provides an insight into the situation of refugees arriving in Serbia's capital.","260":"In Yemen, the capital city of Aden was seized by Saudi-backed troops and militiamen after securing the airport and presidential palace. However, the separatist militia commander stated that most areas were still in control of them. The civil war has exposed a rift within the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government in Yemen's civil war. Saudi Arabia backs President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, while the United Arab Emirates backs the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which accuses Mr Hadi's cabinet of mismanagement and is critical of his ties to Islamists. For the past three years, the two sides have been part of an uneasy alliance against the rebel Houthi movement, which controls much of north-western Yemen. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. Aden has served as the government's temporary capital since 2015, when President Hadi and his cabinet were forced to flee Sanaa by the Houthis. Almost three weeks ago, after a separatist leader was killed in a Houthi attack, the STC-aligned Security Belt militia - which is armed and funded by the UAE - seized control of Aden from Saudi-backed forces after three days of fighting that left dozens of people dead. The separatists also overran cities and towns elsewhere in the south, including Ataq, the capital of Shabwa province, and Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan province. The STC demanded that Mr Hadi's cabinet be replaced, but the government said it would not negotiate until the separatist fighters withdrew from military installations and returned to their previous positions. It accused the UAE of responsibility for the \"armed rebellion\" - an allegation that officials in Abu Dhabi denied. On Monday, two days after pro-government forces retook Ataq, the UAE and Saudi Arabia issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire in Yemen. The statement urged all parties involved in the conflict to commit to ending the fighting and focusing on peace efforts. The statement also urged all sides to abide by a previous agreement reached in December 201","261":"In its first progress report, the Glasgow 2014 organizing committee said that venues were starting to take shape and key infrastructure was being put in place. The total cost of the Games is now expected to be about \u00a3523.6m. Earlier this year, concerns were raised about funding cuts threatening the Games' legacy. The progress report said that extensive work had already been put in place to develop and deliver a lasting social, economic, and sporting legacy. Glasgow 2014 is being delivered in partnership with Commonwealth Games Scotland, the Scottish government, and Glasgow City Council. March this year marked the half way point since it was announced that the city had won the right to host the 2014 Games. The report said that almost \u00a330m had been spent to date on planning and preparations. It forecast that a further \u00a340m would be spent in 2011\/12. The report said the organizing team, established in 2008, now included 50 people and was moving from its current base in George Square to newly refurbished premises in Albion Street in Merchant City. The report said progress was \"well under way and on schedule.\" \"Policies, strategies and budgets have been established along with all the relevant milestones which will ensure that Glasgow is ready to host the Games on time and on budget,\" it said. The report highlighted how work on venues such as the National Indoor Sports Arena and the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome complex was progressing. It said work was also under way to build the first phase of the Commonwealth Village in the city's east end, which will provide accommodation and facilities for 6,500 competitors. It also outlined how the completion of key infrastructure projects like the M74 extension and the Airdrie to Bathgate rail ink would benefit the Games.

He has defended other prominent lawyers, including Chen Guangcheng and Gao Zhisheng, as well as practitioners of the banned Falun Gong movement. A representative of campaign group Amnesty International questioned the validity of the allegations against Li. The lawyer was detained in 2015 as part of a wider government crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping. His trial took place on Tuesday in the Tianjin City Number Two Intermediate People's Court and concerned state secrets, the court said on its Weibo social media account. 'Smear and attack' In its ruling, the court said that since 2008 Li had used social media and foreign media to \"smear and attack state organs and the legal system\". It also said he had used foreign funds to \"interfere in high-profile cases\" and colluded with several people \"harbouring subversive ideas\", including lawyers and those \"involved in illegal religious activities\". His jail sentence had been suspended for four years and he would be denied his political privileges, the court said. The suspension means Li could be released imminently, although it is unclear whether he has been. His time spent in detention should also count towards his jail sentence. Amnesty International's China researcher, Patrick Poon, said that holding the trial in secret showed allegations against Li were \"groundless and weak\".

Despite the risks, she has continued to conduct media interviews about the lack of due process in the case against her husband. The suspended prison sentence, announced without warning, will on the one hand be a relief because it ought to mean that Li will now be released. But it will also almost certainly mark the beginning of a new period of uncertainty and danger for Li Heping and his family.\n\nKey points:\n\n1. Li Heping was sentenced in a closed-door trial.\n2.

They claim the decision not to detain him under the Mental Health Act and to withdraw continuous observation in prison contributed to his death. The Ministry of Justice said the welfare of inmates was a top priority. Mr Saunders' mother Donna said the way the prison service handled her son's case was \"absolutely appalling\". His father, Mark, said his son \"should never have gone to the prison in the first place\". Mr Saunders was arrested in December on suspicion of attempted murder after his father and brother were stabbed when they tried to stop him cutting his throat. When he was taken to a police station, he again told a doctor he was going to kill himself. But two psychiatrists he saw later were not made aware of his previous suicide attempt. They were unable to make a referral for detention under the provisions of the Mental Health Act as Mr Saunders stated he was too tired to participate in an assessment. This finding was disclosed in a report by The South Essex Partnership University NHS Trust (SEPT) which revealed he was suffering from severe paranoia when he told his girlfriend people were trying to harm him. An initial assessment by SEPT staff decided he posed a risk of harming himself or others. Mr Saunders' parents said when he was taken to Chelmsford Prison they made repeated attempts to alert staff to their son's intention to kill himself. Mrs Saunders said she pleaded with staff to keep him on constant watch instead of switching to half-hourly observations. Her son electrocuted himself in his cell on 4 January and his death is now subject to a report by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman. According to the most recent Independent Monitoring Board report, there has been a 25% reduction in staffing at HMP Chelmsford. Steve Gillen, General Secretary of the Prison Officer's Association, said staff at HMP Chelmsford were under extreme pressure with a high turnover of prison officers. The Ministry of Justice said the welfare of inmates was a top priority.

The girl's mother said her daughter came home and told her what had happened, but then when she went to fetch water she took her own life. Her parents reported the matter to the police but became frustrated by an apparent lack of action. Together with other parents they staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday.

It will also give legal backing to bulk collection of internet traffic. The Home Office was forced to revise the draft bill after concerns by three committees of MPs it did not do enough to protect privacy and was too vague. Home Secretary Theresa May said the revised bill, published on Tuesday, reflected many of these concerns, and was \"both clearer and stronger in protecting privacy\". For Labour, shadow home secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the stronger safeguards but said the party \"will not be rushed\" into reaching a judgement on the bill as \"it has major implications for privacy and how we are governed and policed\". He said areas of potential disagreement concerned \"the most intrusive powers\" and \"the widening of access to Internet Connection Records\". The bill expands the purposes for which police can obtain internet connection records, which are details of the websites and online applications people use. It says they can be acquired for a \"specific investigation\" provided it is \"necessary and proportionate\". This clause was not contained in the draft legislation. Police will also get the power to hack into computers and smart phones - so called \"equipment interference\" - normally reserved for the security services, when there is a \"threat to life\" situation, such as locating a missing child. This is an extension of police powers in the draft legislation. Ministers say the new powers are needed to fight terrorism, but internet firms have questioned their practicality - and civil liberties campaigners say it clears the way for mass surveillance of UK citizens. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"On first reading, the revised Bill barely pays lip service to the concerns raised by the committees that scrutinized the draft Bill. \"If passed, it would mean that the UK has one of the most draconian surveillance laws of any democracy.\"","275":"The Fan ID is a special document that allows fans to enter Russia without a visa.

Political tensions with Russia have escalated in recent months with the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury.

It described them as not \"dissuasive and proportionate\" based on the size of the island's finance sector.

The fines can be levied for failing to carry out checks on customers, not carrying out regular risk reviews and failing to make the disclosures necessary under Guernsey law. The proposals compare to fines of 5,000,000 euro or 10% of the total annual turnover of a credit institution or financial institution across the European Union. The Policy Council said the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and Guernsey International Business Association have been involved in the development of and support the changes. The proposals do not address the other main criticism of the Moneyval report - that the number of investigations, prosecutions and convictions for money laundering in the Bailiwick are \"disproportionately low\" compared to other jurisdictions.

The busiest included Islay during the isle's whisky festival, Sumburgh because of oil-related work and Stornoway due to school building work. Dundee, however, reported a 11.3% fall in passengers. Hial said this was because of reduced capacity on the airport's London City route, and a decline in passengers on its Belfast and Birmingham routes. The operator said the fall in passenger numbers had been offset slightly by the earlier start this year of Dundee's Jersey charter route. Growing demand Inverness was the busiest airport in the group, reporting an 8.4% rise - 55,519 passengers. Numbers were boosted by the continuing success of the city's service to Amsterdam in Holland and additional Gatwick flights, Hial said.

Voters would not be able to trigger the process, the committee noted. Deputy PM Nick Clegg has previously argued that the right to trigger a by-election should not be \"unqualified\". Under current rules, if an MP receives a prison sentence of more than 12 months, they automatically lose their seat. The government proposes that, in future, if an MP receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or less, their constituents will be petitioned - and if 10% support the idea there will be a by-election. A petition would also be triggered if MPs in the House of Commons decided that one of its members was guilty of \"serious wrongdoing\". But under government plans it is not possible for an MP's constituents to instigate the \"recall\" process to force a by-election. 'Cut of the jib' The planned conditions were too \"narrow\", the committee declared. \"It is vital that there is public confidence in the political process,\" Labour MP and committee chairman Graham Allen said. \"But the restricted form of recall proposed by the government risks creating the illusion that people will have a say in recalling their elected representative while ensuring that this will probably never happen in practice. \"There is a real danger that this could alienate people still further.\" Testifying before the committee in April, Mr Clegg said the plans were not intended to give voters \"an unlimited, unqualified, untrammelled right to trigger a by-election, whenever you happen to feel like it, because you don't like the cut of the jib of your local MP\". He said he was open to suggestion from his fellow MPs as to what should constitute \"serious wrongdoing\".

The Sikh community is proud of their contribution to the British army, and they hope that the statue will serve as a reminder to those who sacrificed their lives in defense of democracy and in the fight for freedom.","285":"- The pair, both former Oscar nominees, will help choose the Palme d'Or winner from films including Michael Haneke's Happy End and Sofia Coppola's Beguiled.\n- They are joined by the likes of Chinese X-Men actress Fan BingBing and Paulo Sorrentino, whose recent hit TV series The Young Pope starred Jude Law.\n- The jury is being presided over by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar.\n- The festival runs for two weeks in May, thankfully not clashing with Smith's headline gig with DJ Jazzy Jeff at Blackpool's Livewire event in August.\n- French actress and singer Agnes Jaoui, German director Maren Ade, South Korean filmmaker Park Chan-Wook and French composer Gabriel Yared will also join the Cannes panel.\n- Yared's scores include those for The English Patient, for which he won an Oscar, and The Talented Mr Ripley.\n- Lynne Ramsay is the only British director with a film in competition.\n- Her latest feature, a thriller titled You Were Never Really Here, stars Joaquin Phoenix.\n- As usual, there will be a number of special screenings out of competition.\n- This year, Barack Obama and Donald Trump will be seen in An Inconvenient Sequel, Al Gore's follow-up to his 2006 climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth.\n- The Cannes film festival runs from 17 to 28 May.","286":"Last year, the passenger numbers at Belfast International Airport rose by 52% to 864,000. This is the highest increase in the last 10 years. The top destination for Northern Ireland residents using Dublin Airport is New York JFK, followed by London Heathrow. The increase coincides with complaints by Northern Ireland airports that UK air passenger tax is holding back expansion. Overall, more than 21 million passengers used Dublin Airport in 2014, representing growth of 8%. By comparison, Belfast International Airport (four million passengers) and George Best, Belfast City Airport (2.5 million passengers) recorded fractional growth, well below 1%. City of Derry Airport saw numbers drop by 9%. Dublin promotes itself heavily in Northern Ireland, both with advertising and at events involving travel agents. Spokesman Paul O'Kane said they \"make no apology\" for doing so\". He added: \"Route choice is the main reason why consumers in Northern Ireland opt for Dublin Airport.\" All Northern Ireland airports are battling to regain business lost during the recession. While they have been adding new routes, they argue Dublin has an edge, especially after the Irish government abolished air passenger tax in 2014.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com June 3, 2020, 1:12 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/business\/management-of-organizations\/belfast-international-airport-report-567753\n\nThe expert discusses the business issues surrounding Belfast International Airport in a report.\n\n$2.19","287":"Mark Ronson\u2019s Uptown Funk released their new song on December 27, 2014.

Without Bruno Mars, there would be no jam. Ed Sheeran scored the tenth week at the top of the album charts. He fell to number two in the single charts while Band Aid 30 climbed to number three. The physical release of Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas saw the charity track climb nine places. However, it was kept off the top spot by Ronson and the ubiquitous Sheeran. The X Factor 2014 contestant Fleur East performed the Ronson\u2019s track during the semi-final on Saturday 6 December. Her mentor Cowell called it \u201cone of the top three performances\u201d in the X-Factor history.

He admitted two counts of sexual activity with a child, five counts of making indecent images of children, and one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Haines was suspended from the school in March 2012. The court heard that Haines was guilty of \"the grossest and most blatant abuse of trust\". Staffordshire Police said the offences were not committed on the school premises. Councillor Gwen Hassall from Stoke-on-Trent City Council said the offences were an extremely serious case. The school has been working closely with the police and the council to investigate the matter.\n\nRead the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences. Each sentence should capture an important part of the text.\n\nArticle:\nThe first was a girl who was found lying unconscious at home. She had been raped and then stabbed by her attacker, who is believed to have died in a suicide pact with his girlfriend. The second was a boy who was found dead in a park, having been brutally beaten to death. He had been a known drug user and had been under the care of social services. Both of these cases are shocking, but they are not isolated incidents. They are part of a trend that is being seen across the country, with children increasingly becoming victims of crime. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, the number of children who are victims of crime has risen by more than a third in the last five years. This includes offences such as robbery, sexual assault, and violent crime. Experts believe that there are a number of factors that are contributing to this increase. One is that more young people are spending time online, and this means that they are more likely to be exposed to predators. Another is that there is a growing number of gangs in the country, and these gangs are often involved in violence. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that more children are being victimized, and this is something that needs to be addressed.\n\nSummary:\nThe article discusses the increase in the number of children who are victims of crime, including robbery, sexual assault, and violent crime.

Antipsychotics are a powerful sedative and are often used when dementia patients become aggressive or distressed. According to a study, published on the BMJ website, the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia should not be used \"in the absence of clear need\". Experts argue that better alternatives are needed to antipsychotics. The study looked at 75,445 people in nursing homes who had dementia and were prescribed antipsychotics. The study suggested that some drugs were associated with more than twice the risk of death than risperidone, which was used as a benchmark to compare the other drugs. The study concluded that the risk of mortality with these drugs was generally increased with higher doses and seemed to be highest for haloperidol and least for quetiapine. The Department of Health said that the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia was \"resulting in as many as 1,800 unnecessary deaths per year. This is simply unacceptable.\" \"That's why reducing the level of antipsychotics prescribing for people with dementia by two-thirds is one the key priorities in the National Dementia Strategy.\" The Dementia Action Alliance - which includes the Alzheimer's Society, Age UK and the Department of Health - has called for all prescriptions for antipsychotics to be reviewed by the end of March 2012. Dr Chris Fox, who researches dementia at the University of East Anglia, said that the study provided an interesting insight into the differential harm of these medicines. More work is needed on alternatives to these medicines in dementia with behavioral problems. In addition, there is a need for better alternatives to antipsychotics in the treatment of dementia.\n\nSummaries are based on articles from the BBC, CNN, the Associated Press, ABC, and NY Times.

There are a number of different assistance dog charities and organizations ranging from the large such as Guide Dogs who currently have 4,700 dogs to the small like Medical Detection Dogs who have 50 dogs that detect sugar level fluctuations in people with diabetes. The training of dogs takes a long time and is often very involved. Puppies sometimes start training at six to eight weeks old as they begin to familiarize themselves with their surroundings and learn commands. All accredited assistance dogs pass the same initial test - a public access test. They also undergo task training which is specific to the disability of the person they will be assisting. Assistance dogs can have \"career changes.\" When training at Guide Dogs for example, a dog who displays acute smell may be recommended to become a medical detection dog, or sometimes they have excellent credentials as both a guide dog and a seizure alert dog giving them the potential to help somebody with both needs - a blind person with epilepsy for example. Dogs which help people with anxiety and other mental health problems are beginning to emerge in the UK, though are more popular in the US. Presently these dogs are not covered by either the Equality Act or recognized by Assistance Dogs UK which oversees seven accredited assistance dog charities and organizations although and campaigners are hopeful this will change. Assistance dog owners have equal rights laid down by the Equality Act 2010. With a dog they have rights to public services supplied by banks, shops, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants. It is against the law for assistance dog owners to be refused access to a taxi or minicab with their dog, unless the driver has a GP certificate showing medical exemption.

Devlin, who was on the run after absconding from HMP Sudbury, was later traced and sentenced to 22 years in prison for two counts of robbery, one count of grievous bodily harm, and one count of absconding from lawful custody. The woman, who is in her 60s, was attacked by Devlin and the other two men who demanded cash and gold. During the attack, Devlin punched the woman's face and when she grabbed his balaclava, she scratched his face. Devlin then sprayed her hands and face with a cleaning fluid and cut her fingernails using nail clippers. Despite his attempts to destroy DNA evidence, Devlin left the clippings behind, which were later analysed and matched to him.

Its use has been accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium. Scotland is the first part of the UK to approve Avastin for routine use on the NHS. It was previously approved by the SMC as a treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. The SMC said: \"Bevacizumab (Avastin) can give patients an extra 3-4 months survival time that is very important in the context of their limited remaining months. \"As no new medicines for this condition have been licensed in the last ten years, bevacizumab was considered to represent a significant breakthrough in treatment.\" A total of 309 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in Scotland in 2013, with 88 losing their life to it in 2014. Prof Nick Reed, consultant clinical oncologist at the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow, said: \"Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. \"The prognosis for advanced disease or recurrent disease is poor and the symptoms are often uncomfortable and distressing for patients who have to stay in hospital for prolonged periods of time. \"This is a much awaited decision in Scotland - there have been no new medicines licensed for over 10 years and the only available treatment has been chemotherapy. \"Avastin is added to chemotherapy and delays the progression of complications and prolongs life by approximately four months.\" He added: \"For any mother, daughter or wife, this is an important amount of time as it allows them to continue to work, be more independent and plan for their family's future.\" 'Constant pain' The SMC also approved a new treatment for patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a painful long-term skin condition which can leave sufferers covered with abscesses.

It works by getting into cancer cells, killing them from the inside, and also boosting the patient's immune system. Further trials are planned for later in the year.\n\nHead and neck cancer, which includes cancer of the mouth, tongue and throat, affects up to 8,000 people every year in the UK. Study leader Dr Kevin Harrington, who is based at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said current treatments were effective if the cancer was picked up early but that many patients were not diagnosed until it was more advanced.\n\nThe herpes virus, which is also being tested in patients with skin cancer, is genetically manipulated so that it grows inside tumour cells but cannot infect normal healthy cells. Once there it has a triple effect - it multiplies, killing tumour cells as it does so, it is engineered to produce a human protein that activates the immune system and it also makes a viral protein that acts as a red flag to immune cells. 'Potential weapon'\n\nIn the 17 patients injected with the virus, in addition to their standard treatment, at the Royal Marsden Hospital, 93% showed no trace of cancer after their tumour had been surgically removed. More than two years later, 82% of patients had not succumbed to the disease.\n\nOnly two of 13 patients given the virus treatment at a high dose relapsed, the journal Clinical Cancer Research reported. There were no safety concerns with use of the virus, the researchers said, and it is hoped the virus could one day be used to fight other types of cancer.\n\n\"Around 35 to 55% of patients given the standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment typically relapse within two years, so these results compare very favourably,\" said Dr Harrington. He is now planning a trial comparing the viral treatment with the standard treatment in people newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer.\n\nSummary:\n\nDr. Harrington's research team at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, UK, has discovered a way to use a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus to kill head and neck cancer cells.

It highlights the need for gender parity in politics and the challenges faced by women in gaining equal representation in Parliament. The article also provides insights into the current situation of women in politics and the efforts being made to close the gender gap.\n\nThe article starts by discussing the gender gap in politics in Kenya. It mentions that women have been pushing for a bigger role in politics through the enactment of a law that fulfills the requirements of the 2010 constitution, which states that \"not more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender\". However, the latest attempt to pass the bill has failed, and the \"boys\" and \"girls\" have gone home on a long holiday, stretching to February. This has resulted in the opportunity to reform the playground being lost, meaning Kenya's parliament continues to lag behind other East African countries in terms of gender balance.\n\nThe article then discusses the reasons behind the gender gap in politics in Kenya. It mentions that there are four key reasons: fear, no whip, no fairness, and no representation.\n\nFear is the first reason mentioned. The article states that in order to satisfy the requirements of the two-thirds gender rule, 42 new female MPs would need to be nominated, raising the total number of legislators from 349 to 391. Some Kenyans fear that in a country with some of the most highly paid MPs in the world, an enlarged national assembly will mean an additional tax burden. Others are afraid that they will lose the right to decide who represents them if political parties assume the role of nominating the additional female MPs. The article mentions that in holding on to their toys, some male MPs have expressed the fear that the calibre of female leaders will be compromised by political parties' use of dubious nomination criteria. However, this issue has never been raised when it comes to nominating male MPs.\n\nThe second reason mentioned is the lack of a whip. The article states that the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) had asked Parliament to have an equal number of men and women MPs, but the Speaker's Office blocked the move. The article mentions that the Speaker's Office had asked PSC to appoint a female whip, but PSC","302":"1.

However, the Energy and Climate Change Committee warns that conditions in the UK are different. The UK's shale gas developers will face technological uncertainties due to different geology, and public opinion may also be more sceptical. The UK is a more densely populated landscape, and shale gas operations will be closer to settlements as a consequence. The MPs believe operators will have to overcome potentially tighter regulations, and the extent of recoverable resources in the UK is also unknown. Therefore, it is too soon to say whether shale gas will achieve US-style levels of success. The MPs urge the government to stop \"dithering\" over energy policy, though, and to ensure there is a system to rebut what \"scare stories\" may arise over the environmental impacts of shale gas. Success with shale gas will reduce dependence on imports and increase tax revenues, but there is a downside: if it takes off, shale gas will shatter the UK's statutory climate change targets unless the government moves much faster with carbon capture and storage technology.\n\nQuestion:\nDo you agree with the report's findings, or is shale gas the answer to the UK's energy needs?\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com October 25, 2021, 5:09 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/business\/management\/shale-gas-507586\n\nThe solution discusses the boom in shale gas and its impact on the environment and public opinion.\n\n$2.19","305":"The article is about the ghost town of Varosha in Famagusta, Cyprus.

They argued that the change is discriminatory, but the High Court disagreed, stating that the policy does not treat women less favourably than men in law. The court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was \"it could be justified on the facts\".

The Department for Work and Pensions welcomed the High Court's judgment, stating that it has always been their view that the changes to women's state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds.","309":"1. But the Plaid leader refused to be drawn on whether she would work with Labour in coalition.\n2. The two parties ran a government together in Cardiff Bay between 2007 and 2011.\n3. At the general election, Plaid said it wanted to work with a UK Labour government to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street.\n4. Looking to ahead to next May's assembly election, Ms Wood said: \"It's a straight fight in many people's minds between Plaid Cymru and Labour.\n5. \"People need to ask themselves who is going to be the next first minister of Wales and they have got a choice between the existing first minister or myself as the first minister candidate for Plaid Cymru - it's as simple as that really.\"\n6.

But speaking to BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme, she said the Tories - who she has ruled out working with - were \"not relevant\" in the assembly.\n8. A Conservative party spokesman responded by saying Leanne Wood was the only person in Wales who believed this, adding: \"In reality, most voters know that a vote for Plaid Cymru is a vote for Labour.\"\n9. He added that \"despite general election coverage beyond their wildest dreams\", Plaid had failed to make an impression outside the seats they already held.\n10. \"Voters seeking respite from 17 painful years of Labour dominance will be looking to Andrew RT Davies and the Welsh Conservatives to deliver a new Wales, and we will be taking that positive message to the doorsteps between now and May 2016,\" he said.\n11.

However, over 2,000 people have signed a petition calling for a public consultation on the general waste changes, which were approved last week. The council said the changes would save 4,000 tonnes of rubbish from landfill and cut carbon emissions. A resident, Linsie Keen, criticized the council for making the decision without consulting the public. She argued that the three-week collection of general waste would affect everyone in the borough and create a lot of waste for residents who cannot get to the local refuse tip. The council said the changes to the general waste bins would apply only to houses and not flats, and that the money saved could be put into other essential services as well as helping to tackle climate change.

In the state of Baja California Sur - popular with tourists - some hotels and restaurants also resumed activities. Mexico has confirmed more than 150,000 infections and about 17,500 deaths. However, the true numbers are thought to be much higher because of insufficient testing. The country has Latin America's second-highest death toll - after Brazil - and the region's third-highest total of cases, after Brazil and Chile, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. Under a phased reopening announced by Mexico City's authorities, about 340,000 factory workers returned to their jobs on Tuesday. Small shops will be able to reopen on Thursday while professional services and some other workers are allowed go back from Friday. Street markets and the historic city centre could be allowed to reopen next week if conditions were deemed appropriate, authorities said. Churches and restaurants would also be able to resume activities at a reduced capacity. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is eager to restart the economy, and his government announced a phased plan to lift restrictions. But critics say he was slow to impose the measures and now has been too quick to lift them. Most of the economy was stopped from 23 March but some industries that were declared key to the functioning of the nation were exempt from the restrictions. Between March and May, more than one million jobs were lost across the country, according to official numbers. The impact of the measures, however, is thought to be much worse as Mexico has high numbers of people in the informal economy. On Monday, beaches reopened in Baja California Sur, home to the popular twin resorts of Los Cabos. Hotels and restaurants can only operate at 30% capacity, and people are being urged to follow social-distancing measures.

The driving tests had been suspended due to the pandemic. However, some critical workers who needed to drive as part of their job were allowed to take tests. The learners who will be taking the driving tests this week have admitted feeling \"rusty\". One of the learners, Jade Bone, has gone more than three months without driving due to the ban on lessons, which was only lifted in England last week. She said that she is a bit more hesitant now and has gone backwards from being \"test-ready\" in January. Her instructor Rob Fenn said that many of his students have \"gone backwards\" from being \"test-ready\" in January. He added that the demand for driving instructors has shot up, and tests were \"essentially fully booked\" due to pent-up demand. Another learner, Olivia Watts, 17, of Chelmsford, Essex, struggled to make a booking. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said earlier this month that the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will \"offer more tests and more examiners\" in a bid to meet demand, including additional slots at weekends and on bank holidays.","313":"In 2010, Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the first South American to receive the prize in 28 years. The award recognized his \"cartography of structures of power\" and \"trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\" Vargas Llosa was born in Arequipa, Peru, and has written more than 30 novels, plays, and essays. He has won numerous other awards, including the Cervantes Prize, the Spanish-speaking world's most distinguished literary honor. His book \"The Time of The Hero\" was controversial in Peru and 1,000 copies were publicly burned by military officers. However, Vargas Llosa's international breakthrough came with this novel, which was based on his experiences at the Peruvian military academy. The Swedish Academy's Peter Englund described Vargas Llosa as a \"divinely gifted story-teller\" and said that his writing touched the reader. The author joked that the Nobel Prize would not affect his craft, but he also expressed that it was a total surprise. He was currently teaching at Princeton University and was told of his win by telephone. While Vargas Llosa's win was considered a surprise to many, it was not entirely unexpected. The author had long been mentioned as a possible Nobel candidate and has won some of the Western world's most prestigious literary medals.","314":"1.

John Bercow, the former Speaker who stepped down from his role last year, said Lord Lisvane had \"ample opportunity\" to raise issues during their five years working together. In a statement, Mr. Bercow said: \"At no stage did he do so, even though he became Clerk of the House - the most senior official. The timing of this intervention is curious.\" The former Speaker, who spent 10 years in the role, has faced other accusations of bullying during his time in office, but has denied all the claims. There have been reports Mr. Bercow - who previously sat as a Conservative MP - has been nominated for a peerage by the outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The prime minister's spokesman said the allegations were \"very concerning\" and should be \"investigated thoroughly.\" No 10 added that \"there can be no place for bullying or abuse in Westminster or any workplace, and it is important that the parliamentary leadership responds fully and promptly to any concerns which are raised.\" Lord Lisvane began working at the House of Commons in 1972 and has held a number of procedural roles, including clerk for Private Members' Bills and clerk for the European Scrutiny Committee. He became Clerk Assistant and Director General of the Chamber and Committee Services in 2009, before stepping up to the Clerk of the House of Commons in 2011. After standing down in 2014, he became a life peer and sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. Former Leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said anyone found to have bullied or harassed colleagues in Parliament \"should not be offered a peerage.\" The now-business secretary, who clashed with Mr. Bercow on a number of occasions in the Commons, told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I worked cross-party to put in place a complaints procedure which would mean anybody, whoever they are, who is found to have bullied or harassed colleagues in Parliament should not be offered a peerage.","316":"Mr Salmond was acquitted of all the charges against him.

The author explains the implications of this decision and quotes the Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, as saying it would help take back control of fishing access to UK waters. The author also includes the reactions of other officials and politicians, such as Ireland's minister for agriculture, food and the marine, Michael Creed, who said the decision was \"unwelcome and unhelpful\". The author then goes on to explain that the London Fisheries Convention sits alongside the EU Common Fisheries Policy, which governs fishing in the 12 to 200 mile area, and that the relationship between the UK and Ireland is governed by a separate arrangement. The article also includes a quote from the Scottish government, which backs the idea of withdrawing from the convention. The author concludes by discussing the implications of the decision on the UK's fishing industry and the potential for it to be used as a \"bargaining chip\" by the government. Overall, the article provides a balanced and informative summary of the key points of the London Fisheries Convention withdrawal and its implications for the UK and its European neighbours.\n\nArticle:\n\nThe London Fisheries Convention (LFC) is a treaty signed in 1964 between the United Kingdom and five other European countries - Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany, and Belgium. The LFC governs access to fishing waters between the UK and these countries. The UK government has recently announced its intention to withdraw from the LFC. This decision has significant implications for the UK's fishing industry, as it will impact the access to fishing waters that the UK's fishing vessels currently enjoy. The LFC allows UK, Dutch, Irish, French, German, and Belgian vessels to fish within six and 12 nautical miles of UK coastline. The UK's Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, has stated that withdrawing from the LFC will help take back control of fishing access to UK waters. The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) governs fishing in the 12 to 200 mile area, and the relationship between the UK and Ireland is governed by a separate arrangement.

He was rushed to the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton, where his oxygen levels were dangerously low. The following morning, his wife Joyce was called by doctors who said he was not going to make it. She was pacing up and down waiting for the phone to ring again, but also not wanting to hear what they might have to say. Before she could get to the hospital, his low oxygen levels started to improve and he was getting better. But several days later, she got another call saying he was going and asked her to go to the hospital and hold his hand while wearing protective equipment. \"Straight away I said yes and they said they would call me back with more information, but they never did,\" Mrs Seery said. \"I didn't know it but he was picking up then. I was just clock-watching wondering if he was still here.\" After three weeks, Mr Seery was squeezing doctors' hands and soon he was awake again. He spent five weeks in hospital before returning home, where he has set about re-building his withered leg muscles and restoring the three stone in weight he lost. \"I've got my appetite back, although food still tastes a bit metallic,\" he said. \"I'm fine.

The island's Environment Minister, Roger Domaille, revealed that the number of tests had been cut from 20 to eight to save money. He said that the fewer tests taken may result in a poor sample that can significantly affect the overall outcome. He also stated that the island's beaches have historically excellent water quality and will continue to improve with the help of Guernsey Water. Rachel Wyatt, a representative from the Marine Conservation Society, explained that several factors could affect a sample, including livestock, faeces from dogs, birds, and sewage systems. In Jersey, 13 out of 16 listed beaches received recommended status for good water quality. To meet the standards, all samples must not exceed 2,000 E. coli per 100ml and sewage discharges must be appropriately treated.\n\n## The Guernsey Environment Department stated that only five out of 13 beaches of the 734 surveyed across the British Isles met the standards for good water quality.\n\nThe Guernsey Environment Department stated that only five out of 13 beaches of the 734 surveyed across the British Isles met the standards for good water quality.

The cable will run directly from Malaysia to South Korea and Japan, with links branching off to other countries. Facebook said the move would support efforts to boost membership in what was already one of its fastest growing markets. \"Our investment in this cable will help support our growth in South Asia, making it possible for us to provide a better user experience for a greater number of Facebook users in countries like India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore,\" a spokesman said. He declined to reveal how much money the firm was putting into scheme, saying only that a consortium of firms had invested $450m (\u00a3280m) in total. Faster links The project to construct and maintain APG is funded by a group that includes two large Chinese internet service providers, China Telecom and China Unicom. The fibre-optic cable will help the countries send and receive data to North America faster, according to consortium leader Time Dotcom. \"This lowers our dependencies on Singapore as the main gateway for internet traffic,\" said its chief executive Saiful Husni. \"We can now channel high volumes of this traffic on our network with the lowest latency [access time], directly to the US.\" Internet traffic can be slowed by the number of \"hops\" traffic has to make as it traverses different stretches of cables, and as it passes through different landing stations. Eyeing Asia The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Facebook's growth in the US had shown signs of \"slowing sharply\", putting further pressure on its share price. But the news was offset by a later Nielsen study suggesting the network was enjoying rapid growth in Asia.

It also suggested the firm was enjoying rapid growth in other countries, including China, Thailand, and Vietnam.","321":"The grenade attack on Mwauras club in Nairobi, Kenya, was a result of a grenade thrown into the club early in the morning of Monday. The police chief, Matthew Iteere, said that investigations had shown no links with the Somali militant group al-Shabab, but the motive for the attack was still being investigated. The attack came a week after Kenya sent troops to Somalia to track down members of the al-Qaeda-linked Islamist group, which Nairobi blames for several kidnappings. The group, al-Shabab, denied carrying out any abductions and threatened reprisals if the troops did not leave. The attack on Mwauras club was not the first in Kenya. In December last year, three people died during a grenade attack at a bus in Nairobi, but it was never clear who was behind it. The al-Shabab group has denied carrying out any abductions, but Kenya's most senior police officer, Matthew Iteere, said that a Russian-made grenade was used inside the nightclub. A local news station, Capital News Radio, quoted a witness as saying that a man had asked to be let in to the Mwauras bar in central Nairobi shortly after 03:00 (0000 GMT). He then hurled a grenade and fled the scene, said the witness. Lawrence Kioko, who was injured in the attack, told Reuters news agency: \"I heard an explosion - there was darkness and I thought the electricity had gone out but when I touched my face, there was blood.\" Video footage showed blood and beer bottles on the floor of the nightclub - upturned seats and debris littered the floor. \"The guys came out running covered in blood. We helped them wash the blood off and they were carried away in ambulances,\" Jacob Musembi, an eyewitness, told Reuters. The police cordoned off the area and no group has so far admitted carrying out the attack. Last week, Kenya announced it would carry out a major security operation in Nairobi to flush out al-Shabab sympathisers once its Somalia operation had ended. The US embassy in Nairobi warned on Saturday of an \"imminent threat\" of attacks in Kenya.","322":"Darcy is a two-year-old Cocker Spaniel from Kellas near Dundee who has undergone an emergency operation to remove her spleen after falling in Glascarnoch Dam in the Highlands in July.

She was announced on Wednesday as the only Scottish finalist in the PDSA Pet Survivor Awards 2016. Mr Drummond said he was delighted to be reunited with Darcy. He said: \"It's amazing to see her doing so well. \"I didn't think she'd be walking nearly as well as she is. \"Both ops have been a great success and she's done amazing just to recover from it.\" The vet said that when Darcy was first brought to the team at Conanvet in Dingwall, it was uncertain whether she would survive.

The chairwoman of parliament, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, said that people's opinions \"will always be heard\". China's embassy in Hanoi has warned its citizens to be careful, referring to the protests as \"illegal gatherings\" that had included some \"anti-China content\". Demonstrators had gathered in various parts of the country over the weekend, including the major urban centres of Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City. Some carried anti-China banners, including one reading: \"No leasing land to China even for one day.\" Protests in the cities were quickly suppressed, but authorities faced much greater public anger in Binh Thuan, where demonstrators threw rocks, set vehicles alight, and briefly occupied the local government headquarters.

Many of the sites who lost their domains have continued trading via alternative addresses. ICE said that it has taken the action to the New York Times but said it could not provide any details because the seizures were part of an \"ongoing investigation\".

The current flag, which includes the Southern Cross constellation and the Union Jack in one corner, represents a period of history from which New Zealand has moved on, according to Mr. Key. He believes that the flag symbolizes a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed, and he argued that it represents a period when New Zealand was dominated by the United Kingdom. Mr. Key said that he likes the silver fern - popularized by national teams including the All Blacks - as an option, and he is open to all ideas for new flag designs. He said that there is no move to cut ties with the British monarchy, and that the country retains a strong and important constitutional link to the monarchy. A group of cross-party lawmakers will oversee the vote process, and a steering group will seek public submissions for new flag designs. One poll late last month showed only 28% of respondents wanted to change the flag, compared to 72% who were happy with the current version.

McGovern admitted to punching Kevin Lunney, the chief operating officer, up to eight times in the face, leaving him with a broken nose and swollen eye. He also threw a cup of boiling water in the face of Dara O'Reilly, the chief financial officer.\n\nThe court heard that McGovern's father had been fired from his job as a driver with Quinn Industrial Holdings the previous day.

The body that represents FE colleges said it would be difficult for them to cope with the cuts. The Welsh government is in the process of drawing up its spending plans and a clearer picture is expected to emerge when it publishes its draft budget in the autumn.\n\nIn a letter to principals seen by BBC Wales, Mr Lewis said FE funding had been under discussion since UK Chancellor George Osborne's spending review in June. \"To date, although no firm decisions on future budget settlements have been taken, institutions have been told to plan on a reduction of at least 5% in 2014\/15,\" he said. \"Further information will be available when the next draft budget is published in October and the Welsh government will work closely with Colegau Cymru to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning.\" Colegau Cymru, the body that represents FE colleges, said the sector had already had to make savings after a series of \"tough\" budget settlements had failed to keep pace with inflation. Its chief executive John Graystone said: \"That (5%) is a big cut for colleges. \"That represents something around about \u00a315m to \u00a320m so it's going to be difficult for colleges to deliver to their current agenda, their current profile with that sort of level.\" With colleges facing the twin demands of tackling disadvantage and delivering skills, he said they would need to \"weigh up both of those key priorities and see where they go with each of those\". It comes after FE colleges were told over the summer that they would be getting an unexpected funding cut of 1.5% this year, taking their Welsh government funding to around \u00a3310m.

He confirmed bonuses would be cut, and he would waive his own. He said he need not have resigned even though he was in charge at Barclaycard during one mis-selling episode. Earlier, the bank said it had set aside another \u00a31bn to cover the costs of the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) to individuals and interest rate hedging products to small firms.\n\u2022 Mr Jenkins was in charge at Barclaycard at a time when PPI was mis-sold. 'Difficult year' Mr Jenkins took over as chief executive in August. He told MPs he repeatedly raised concerns with the board and Mr Diamond over the culture at the bank, and that \"actions\" were needed rather than words. He said the bonus pool for 2012 had already been \"substantially\" reduced and would be cut further owing to the mis-selling issues. Mr Jenkins said last week he would waive his bonus for 2012 after a \"very difficult\" year for the bank. He would have been entitled to a maximum of \u00a32.75m, in addition to his \u00a31.1m salary. Details of the full bonus pool are expected with the company's annual results next Tuesday.

But that was better than the previous month's reading of 51.1, which had marked a 16-month low. The eurozone economy has seen 18 months of continuous, albeit weak growth. Markit said its latest PMI survey, which combines the results of individual surveys of the construction, services and manufacturing industries, suggested the eurozone economy grew by just 0.1% in the last three months of 2014. Persistently low inflation since the start of last year has led consumers and business to hold off making purchases or making investments in the expectation that prices will continue to fall. The problem has been exacerbated since the summer by the falling price of oil. Brent crude has fallen by more than 50% since August to $51.54 per barrel. The fear of deflation led the European Central Bank (ECB) to lower interest rates to 0.05% and begin an asset purchase programme to inject cash into the economy in August. However, the ECB has resisted taking the same action as central banks in the US, UK and Japan by buying government debt. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the weakness of the latest PMI surveys would \"add to calls for more aggressive central bank stimulus, including full-scale quantitative easing, to be undertaken as soon as possible\". Grexit He added: \"The euro zone will look upon 2014 as a year in which recession was avoided by the narrowest of margins, but the weakness of the survey data suggests there's no guarantee that a renewed downturn will not be seen in 2015.\" Analysts expect the ECB to announce its bond-buying programme - also known as quantitative easing - later this month.

While his family has been told that he can be released, they do not know how to get him out of the war-torn country safely. Jane Lawrence, his mother, stated that if Luke leaves prison, he could be kidnapped by a rival group. She said that her son risks being kidnapped by a rival group if he leaves prison. Luke converted to Islam in his late teens - taking the name Jamal, before moving to Yemen, where he married his Yemeni wife Tagreed. They have a young son. Two years ago, when he presented his British passport to withdraw money to fund his family's passage out of Yemen, Luke was arrested. His family in Cardiff says the Houthi rebels holding Luke in the capital city of Sanaa, will release him if he is escorted out by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC). Yemen is currently engulfed by a civil war that has claimed thousands of lives. Many routes are unsafe for travel and the family has been told the only safe route out of Sanaa is via neighbouring Djibouti. But Luke and his wife were badly treated in Djibouti when they previously tried to get out through that port in 2015, his family said. They added that it was because of that experience, Luke and his wife felt they had no option but to go back to Yemen, despite the prevailing advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to leave. The family said it would be unsafe for Luke to be taken back to Djibouti now as there was no British consular presence. They have set up their own fundraising appeal to cover flights, hotels and insurance costs involved in getting the family out, and a visa application for Luke's wife. Ms Lawrence said when she was told Luke's name had been cleared she \"couldn't believe it\". \"But then all of a sudden we had all these hurdles to get over. Where were they going to take him? How were we going to cover the costs? It just feels like it is never ever ending.\" Ms Lawrence said it would be \"a dream\" to see the family back in Cardiff.

They found bad dreams improved the effectiveness of the brain in reacting to frightening experiences when awake. But really terrifying nightmares were found to have a negative impact. The neuroscientists, from the University of Geneva, the University Hospitals of Geneva in Switzerland and the University of Wisconsin in the US, have suggested that dreams could be used as a form of therapy for anxiety disorders. Dreams 'prepare for real-life danger' The study looked at whether bad dreams - which are moderately frightening rather than excessively traumatic - might serve a useful purpose. With more than 250 electrodes attached to 18 subjects - and with another 89 people keeping diaries of their sleeping and dreaming - the researchers examined how the emotions experienced during dreams were connected with feelings when awake. The findings, published in Human Brain Mapping, showed that bad dreams helped people to \"react better to frightening situations\". When someone woke after a bad dream, the area of the brain that controlled their response to fear was found to be more effective. This suggested that bad dreams were a way of preparing people for fear in their waking lives. The greater the frequency of frightening dreams, the researchers found a higher level of activity in the area of the brain that manages fear. \"We were particularly interested in fear. What areas of our brain are activated when we're having bad dreams?\" said Lampros Perogamvros, a researcher in the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Geneva. Nightmare emotions The researchers said they found a \"very strong link between the emotions we feel in both sleep and wakefulness\", with bad dreams being a way of simulating frightening situations as a rehearsal for such experiences when awake. \"Dreams may be considered as a real t\n\n## Get access to knowledge base\n\nGuarantee No Hidden\nCharges Unlimited\nKnowledge base","354":"1) A majority of the people in the northern areas of Sri Lanka are displaced for the fifth time.\n2) According to Mr. Foster, the Sri Lankan government has not given the freedom to humanitarian agencies to help the people of the northern areas of Sri Lanka.\n3) The British government has increased its humanitarian aid in light of the circumstances on the ground.\n4) LTTE does not allow freedom of speech.\n5) Mr. Foster urged the LTTE to respect the international laws and protect the civilians.\n\n(200 words)\n\nPlease make corrections if necessary.

If he had won, he would have faced an Israeli athlete in the next round. Iran does not recognize the state of Israel and bans its athletes from competing against Israelis. The Iranian wrestling federation has said it will challenge the ban, which was announced by the United World Wrestling Disciplinary Chamber on Friday. \"Karimachiani, on instruction of his coach Jamshidi, wilfully lost his 1\/8 finals match against Alikhan Zhabrilov,\" the chamber said, referring to the Russian opponent in the match. \"Both wrestler and coach were found to have acted in direct violation of the International Wrestling Rules... and the UWW Disciplinary Regulations,\" it added. Karimachiani's ban was set to run for two years from the date of the incident - making him eligible to compete in late May 2018. His coach, Hamidreza Jamshidi, was also banned from the sport until the end of November 2019. During the November 2017 match-up in Poland, Karimachiani was leading 3-2 in the fourth minute of the match. Winning would have set him up against Israel's Uri Kalashnikov in the next bout. Footage of the match appeared to contain a man's voice shouting instructions to lose, before the match is briefly paused for an exchange between athlete and coach. In the final 45 seconds, Karimachiani is tackled to the ground before he rolls over and over, resulting in his opponent winning 14-3. Many Iranians took to social media to express outrage at the spectacle. More than 5,000 tweets were sent following the match with hashtags which translate as #lose_alireza, #I_am_telling_you_to_lose, and #you_must_lose.\n\n\u00a9 BrainMass Inc. brainmass.com June 4, 2020, 2:09 am ad1c9bdddf\nhttps:\/\/brainmass.com\/english-language-and-literature\/summarizing\/summary-of-the-","360":"The States of Guernsey said that the majority of groups displaced during the six months the Sir John Loveridge Hall will be used have been relocated. Among the solutions are school sport facilities and parish halls. Work continues to resolve the remaining bookings and events yet to be relocated, the States said. Sports teams in the island had previously raised concerns they would struggle to find appropriate replacement venues for their leagues. The first batch of nearly 1,000 vaccines arrived in Guernsey on Thursday, but these will be administered at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital. 'Prepared to adapt' The Guernsey Sports Commission said they had undertaken a \"huge amount of work\" with the States and affected teams to relocate them. Graham Chester from the commission thanked Beau Sejour, sports organisations and facility owners for their \"willingness to go the extra mile to help out\". He said: \"Although it has been impossible to replace like for like, we are thankful that those sports affected have been pragmatic about the situation and prepared to adapt their operations to suit the new venues and timings available.\"","361":"Their grants are being cut because these privately-run but state-funded schools will not use the services councils provide to state schools. The Local Government Association claims ministers are reducing council grants by \u00a3350m more than they will save. The government said the double funding of services was not sustainable. Local education authorities face cuts of \u00a3413m over the next two years tied to the expansion in the academies programme. However, Department for Education figures suggest they will only save a maximum of \u00a360m from the changes if 200 schools convert to academy status each year. This would leave them about \u00a3350m out of pocket, says the LGA. The claims were supported by the F40 group, which campaigns for fairer funding of education. Its chief executive Gillian Hayward, who chairs the Gloucestershire Schools Forum, suggested the additional money for academies was being \"top-sliced from the money which should be available for all schools\". She added: \"Such practice would also be at odds with government indications that there should be no financial incentive or disincentive to a school becoming an academy. \"Executive members of F40 believe that there is now a significant financial advantage to academy conversion, and that this is unfair to traditional schools.","362":"No-one here is in any doubt that Boko Haram did it. It seems people do not know where to vent their anger now but hostility hangs in the air. Inside the mosque, the sight is shocking. Beyond the blood-soaked steps, the floor is strewn with debris: scattered prayer mats, beads, smashed spectacles and pages from the Koran. There are bullet marks on the pillars and the suicide bombers' blood can be seen splattered across the walls and right up inside the dome. \"We heard a loud sound outside, but people said let's continue praying,\" said Adamu Magashi, who was inside facing the imam who had just finished his sermon at the time of the attack. \"Then a bomb went off right inside the mosque and somebody started shooting. We tried to move towards the imam and there was another blast - we couldn't even see each other as we tried to escape,\" he told me after returning to the scene. Attackers beaten Outside, a large crowd stands over the twisted remains of the motorbikes and bicycles that were engulfed in the flames when the first bomber struck, driving a car into the assembled worshippers. Policemen occasionally disperse the agitated throng. Another crowd stares at a collection of blackened shoes that has been gathered up in the large open sandy area in front of the green domed mosque. \"This was the first time ever the five daily prayers were not observed in this mosque,\" one shocked man, who has often prayed here, told me, describing the attack as unimaginable. On Friday, the terror swiftly turned to fury when three of the gunmen were overpowered right outside the mosque. They were beaten and burnt to death. Had their lives been spared, they could have provided useful intelligence on the group behind the violence - not that the police have a good record of investigating and prosecuting.

This follows similar lawsuits from rapper 2 Millly, actor Alfonso Ribeiro, and floss dancer Backpack Kid. Epic Games has not commented on the ongoing litigation. The game had previously featured two dance moves, the Random and the Carlton, which have now been removed from Microsoft-owned game Forza Horizon 4. Microsoft has not commented on the removal of these dances, but other dance moves remain. The Random dance move, created by a YouTuber known as Orange Shirt Boy, was recently used in a competition organized by Epic Games. The boy's mother has filed a lawsuit against Epic Games, claiming that the company had not sought her son's consent to use, display or reproduce the dance move. The lawsuit makes no mention of the competition and tweets discussing it have been deleted. The cases against Fortnite raise interesting questions about whether a dance can be copyrighted and will be closely watched by other game developers. Courts deciding whether such moves are subject to copyright will look at a range of factors, including the level of creativity, the complexity or length of the dance, and how it was created. Most of the dance moves in video games are short, led by one or two individuals, and are not choreographed. The legal action against Fortnite highlights the complexities of copyright and intellectual property laws in the gaming industry.","365":"1) The police said that a group of people was seriously assaulted at Birkenhill Woods on Monday morning.\n2) The oldest victim died at Dr Gray's Hospital, while two other victims, aged 70 and 35, suffered serious, but not life-threatening, injuries.\n3) A 35-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident.\n4) The police are carrying out additional patrols in the area while the investigation continues.\n5) The police said that the circumstances of the incident will understandably cause concern within the local community, as such incidents are so incredibly rare.\n\nNote: This summary is based on a single reading and may contain some errors or omissions.","366":"The Next consortium was unable to meet the price expectations of the vendor, putting 13,000 jobs at risk.

The Beano, which is 80 years old, has been renamed the McMenace for a new exhibition celebrating the anniversary.

The Greens made big gains, while the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is set to remain the largest party. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) lost ground but may just qualify for seats. The party is currently represented in all 16 German state legislatures and in some parts of the country polls in double digits. The vote comes days after a racist gunman killed nine people in shisha bars in the western city of Hanau. 'Bitter day' for CDU The result, if confirmed by final vote figures, will most likely lead to a continuation of the red-green coalition in the left-leaning northern port city. The Christian Democrats (CDU) have slipped into third place with little more than 11%. Party general secretary Paul Ziemiak said it was a \"bitter day\", and acknowledged that Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's resignation announcement following a scandal in the eastern state of Thuringia had damaged the party. The CDU there caused consternation by voting with the AfD to elect a regional leader, a move Ms Merkel described as \"unforgiveable\" and against the CDU's values. The AfD has grown in popularity in recent years but has been condemned for its extreme views on immigration, freedom of speech and the press. Meanwhile Greens national co-leader Robert Habeck told German TV the party's performance was a great success. The preliminary results gave them 24.1%, almost twice as many votes as five years ago. \"We have a very challenging situation for democracy in Germany, and the CDU is tied up in its own problems... It will be up to us to give the land direction and trust,\" Mr Habeck said. The party may have benefited from the presence of climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined thousands of people in a demonstration in the city on Friday.

However, the witnessing rules of writing a will are strict, and failing to correctly sign it in front of two independent witnesses, who are physically present, in England and Wales is likely to lead to a judge ruling the document, and any legacy in it, invalid. The current law dates from 1837, the start of Queen Victoria's reign, to protect individuals at a time of less efficient record keeping, lower levels of literacy, and less advanced technology. The existing law has been tested by the lockdown, isolation, and social distancing requirements in place during the coronavirus outbreak - at a time when many people want to finalise a will at relatively short notice. This has led to people witnessing signatures over garden fences and standing in driveways, with solicitors often overseeing from a safe distance. The Law Society, the solicitors' trade body, has called on the Ministry of Justice to make changes to the law, such as allowing the careful use of video conferencing in the process. Ian Bond, who chairs the society's wills and equity committee, also called on the government to follow the Australian model, where the law is the same but where judges investigate and show some flexibility in allowing wills to stand. However, the Ministry of Justice said that there are no plans to relax the strict rules.

The disagreement between the two organizations started when Wildcat Haven released a video of a \"pure\" wildcat which they said had been filmed near Huntly in Aberdeenshire. They suggested that its purity had been verified by an independent expert at the National Museums of Scotland and that it was the first living wildcat to score full marks on an observation scale which determines its purity. The 21-point scale is a recognized measure of how much a wildcat has become hybridized with domestic cats. Rival group Scottish Wildcat Action (SWA) immediately sought to discredit the claim, saying that it was \"not news\" to them that a pure wildcat had been found and that the one in the video was \"extremely similar\" to one they had already identified. At this point, it looked like both sides were in agreement that what had been filmed was actually a pure wildcat. But then on Thursday Scottish Wildcat Action released a second video which was captured in the same area in December. It now appeared to question whether the cat in both videos was actually a \"pure\" wildcat at all. Dr. Andrew Kitchener from the National Museums of Scotland said: \"Wildcat Haven approached me to comment on [Wednesday's] video footage, which shows one cat in the wild. The animal displays a number of characteristics of the Scottish wildcat, however not all of the characteristics which are used to identify the Scottish wildcat are visible in the video. While the cat in this video shows a high number of characteristics of the Scottish wildcat, there is not yet sufficient evidence to fully determine its purity.\" So why the apparent shift in position from Scottish Wildcat Action? It would appear to stem from the implied criticism that SWA is involved in a project to breed and then release wildcats which contain a small degree of hybridization with domestic cats.

The show faced off against The Greatest Dancer, a dance competition show, which had an average of 3.2 million viewers. The second episode of The Masked Singer had a slightly lower viewership of 4.2 million, but this was still considered a success. The show keeps the identities of its singing celebrities a closely guarded secret, disguising them as butterflies, octopuses, ducks, and other creatures. Spoiler warning - the identities of the first two unmasked celebrities are revealed below: Patsy Palmer, who played Bianca Butcher in EastEnders, and Alan Johnson, the former Home Secretary. The concept was brought to the UK after becoming a break-out hit in South Korea and the US. The Radio Times gave the show five stars, describing it as \"equal parts Stars in Their Eyes, Black Mirror, and a hen do - but entirely brilliant.\" On the other hand, the Guardian gave it only one star, stating that \"its twist on a tired genre shouldn't really work, but The Masked Singer is utterly fun-filled and fantastic viewing for Saturday night.\" The show's second episode lost out to Call the Midwife, which was the most-viewed programme of the weekend with an average of seven million viewers.","380":"The article talks about a giraffe sculpture named \"Dotty\" that was used to smash the window of a nearby sports shop in Worcester after being removed from its plinth.

Ghosn, who had been released on bail after 108 days in custody, has denied any wrongdoing and called the latest arrest \u201coutrageous and arbitrary\u201d. Tokyo prosecutors entered his residence before 6:00 a.m. local time on Thursday (21:00 GMT Wednesday) and took him to their office on suspicion of misappropriating Nissan funds for personal use. His lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, said it was almost unheard of to arrest someone after being released on bail. \u201cI am innocent of the groundless charges and accusations against me,\u201d Ghosn said in a statement released by his representatives. He said the arrest was \u201cpart of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors\u201d. The move is the latest twist in a case that has attracted global attention. Ghosn was the architect of the alliance between Nissan and French carmaker Renault, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. He is credited with turning around the fortunes of Nissan and Renault over several years. The prosecutors said Mr Ghosn\u2019s latest arrest related to transfers of Nissan funds totalling $15 million between 2015 and 2018. They suspect $5 million of that amount was used by Ghosn for personal expenditure. Local media had previously said that authorities had been building a new case against him involving payments to a dealership in Oman. In Japan, prosecutors are permitted to re-arrest a suspect on a slightly different accusation, with approval from the courts. The clock is then reset and another 20 days of detention can be granted without bail. The prosecutors have not revealed any details of the allegations against Ghosn. The case has raised questions about corporate governance in Japan, where the practice of lifetime employment and close ties between management and the boardroom is common. The arrest of Ghosn has caused a stir in Japan, where the automaker is a national symbol. Nissan, which has been undergoing a major overhaul, has said the allegations against Ghosn were \u201cextremely serious\u201d. Prosecutors have also charged","383":"In this article, we are presented with the dramatic images of Chang Song-thaek being escorted from a party session by uniformed guards. The state news agency KCNA accused Mr Chang of forming factions against the state, corruption and \"depraved\" acts such as womanising and drug abuse. Analysts say such a public dismissal is unique and could signal a wider purge. It is the biggest upheaval in North Korea's leadership since Mr Kim succeeded his father two years ago. Seen as an economic reformer, Mr Chang handled talks with Pyongyang's only major ally, China. The KCNA state news agency said the decision was announced after a meeting of the ruling communist Korean Workers' Party Politburo over the weekend. News of his dismissal filtered out in South Korea last week along with reports that two of his close aides had been executed for corruption. It is unclear when these latest images date from. 'Dissolute' life The KCNA report accuses Mr Chang of being part of a faction working against the North Korean state. \"Chang pretended to uphold the party and leader but was engrossed in such factional acts as dreaming different dreams and involving himself in double-dealing behind the scenes.\" It accused him of offences such as financial mismanagement and selling off national resources for his personal gain, but it also denounced him for leading what it called \"a dissolute and depraved life\". \"Ideologically sick and extremely idle and easy-going, he used drugs and squandered foreign currency at casinos while he was receiving medical treatment in a foreign country under the care of the party,\" the KCNA report said. It added that he had \"improper relations\" with several women and \"was wined and dined at back parlours of deluxe restaurants\". The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says such an official announcement detailing his alleged crimes is unique. Almost overnight, Chang Song-thaek has morphed from uncle and mentor to North Korea's young leader, to \"anti-revolutionary\" criminal outcast, our correspondent reports. She adds that this could signal a wider purge within the country's ruling party, which is known for its brutal tactics.\n\nLast edited by a moderator:","384":"In this article it describes the proposed new target of 40% reduction in the EU by 2030.

Mr Johnson has told his Italian counterpart it is \"right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion, supported by the courts\", in line with Charlie's \"best interests.\" Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. Doctors say he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. During questions to the prime minister, on Wednesday, Theresa May said she was \"confident\" Great Ormond Street Hospital \"have, and always will, consider any offers or new information that has come forward with consideration of the well-being of a desperately ill child\". Charlie's parents raised \u00a31.3m on a crowdfunding site to pay for experimental treatment in the US.

He intended to be paid for the animals by claiming they were part of an authorised badger cull. Milne admitted wilfully killing 28 badgers and possessing 37. He also admitted failing to store firearms securely. He was given an 18-week suspended sentence at Bodmin Magistrates' Court. Police raided Milne's home and business addresses in July. At his home they found a freezer in an outbuilding containing eight badger carcasses. A vet examined all of the dead animals and found 28 had injuries consistent with being shot. Milne had a licence for badger culling issued by Natural England, but these animals had been killed outside of the cull period. He told police he intended to submit them for payment when the cull period re-opened. His licence has since been suspended. Badger culling areas were introduced by Natural England as part of government efforts to control tuberculosis in cattle. Michael Green, defending, said this was \"an unusual case\" and his client \"was taking a chance and clearly made a bad decision\". Milne previously worked as an engineer but gave that up to set up a field sports company in 2009, for which he obtained firearms certificates. The court heard a number of farmers had provided positive references in relation to his character and the pest control service he provided. He was also ordered to carry 150 hours of unpaid work and a deprivation order was issued for the guns, ammunition and carcasses.\n\n### Don\u2019t waste time\n\nGet a verified expert to help you with Summary of the article \"28 Badgers Found Dead After Man's Animal Cruelty\"\n\nHire Verified Expert\n\n### Cite this page\n\nSummary of the article \"28 Badgers Found Dead After Man's Animal Cruelty\".

But China has been showing a very different face to countries closer to home in an increasingly tense confrontation over rival claims to the resource-rich waters of the South China Sea. It is a region where the peaceful nature of China's rise is starting to be questioned as it pushes a long-standing maritime claim that stretches deep into South East Asia. \"China is becoming much more confident in the region and there are signs it is becoming giddy with success. It has become much more influential much more quickly than it expected,\" says Dr Kerry Brown of the Asia Programme at Chatham House in London. Vietnam and the Philippines in recent months have seen the snarl of a resurgent regional power that is fast losing patience with the gripes of smaller neighbours over maritime borders. \"If these countries do not want to change their ways with China, they will need to prepare for the sound of cannons. It may be the only way for the dispute in the sea to be resolved,\" said the state run newspaper, the Global Times, in a recent editorial. Hard power Chinese officials have been more restrained in their comments, but foreign ministry spokesmen have issued a series of warnings about what they see as encroachments into Chinese waters. Beijing says it does want a peaceful solution. But Vietnam and the Philippines say Chinese ships have stepped up harassment of vessels involved in oil exploration and fishing. \"The growth of Chinese military spending is beginning to translate into hard power,\" says John Hemmings, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. \"This is the first major sign that a more confident Chinese grand strategy is emerging. It is in the South China Sea that there is a real risk of discord between the US and China.\" The disputes are about oil and gas reserves and fishing rights in the South China Sea, which is claimed entirely by China, but is also claimed in part by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.

Mrs Roche, of Rhondda Cynon Taff, went to hospital three times before surgery. She had a cardiac arrest during surgery 12 days after the race and died because of neglect, coroner Graeme Hughes said. Mr Hughes said there was \"a failure to provide basic medical attention\" for Mrs Roche and delivered a narrative conclusion. He added: \"There have been gross failings by clinicians to diagnose the fracture and that contributed to the development of deep vein thrombosis which was responsible for pulmonary thromboembolism that led to cardiac arrest.\" Mr Kamal Asaad, medical director at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, apologised to Mrs Roche's family and friends for the failings in her care. \"Words are of little comfort at this distressing time but we would like to assure the family that changes have already been made to help prevent such failures in the system from happening in the future,\" he said. \"A full investigation into the care she received was instigated immediately, and actions are being taken and closely monitored to address the shortcomings that were identified. These include strengthening our clinical processes, including X-ray procedures in A&E as well as our protocols for more detailed assessments and investigations before reaching a definitive diagnosis. \"We accept the coroner's ruling and will now review all of his findings to ensure we fully address all of the failings.\" Pontypridd Coroners' Court heard Mrs Roche, of Beddau, entered the race with her husband Steven to raise money for Parkinson's disease research after her father was diagnosed with the illness.

These exchanges are dominated by energy firms who fear oil will fall further from its current 12-year low of $29 when Iran resumes oil exports. Iran has said it will sell up to 500,000 extra barrels of crude oil. Economic sanctions, in place for nearly 40 years, were lifted after inspectors confirmed on Saturday that Iran had taken the required steps to limit its nuclear programme.\n\nThe Saudi Tadawul All Share Index, the largest market in the region, dropped during trading to its lowest level since early 2011, closing at 5,520 points. Share prices in all six of the other Gulf stock exchanges also dropped, as investors weighed up a stronger Iranian economy and extra oil in an already over-supplied market.\n\nSaudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi said it would take \"some time\" to restore stability to the global oil market, but added that he remained optimistic.\n\nIt's a bit surprising that markets are surprised - Iran has promised since the Vienna agreement was signed in July to pump 500,000 additional barrels of crude per day when sanctions were lifted. Most oil traders have accelerated their sell-off of oil, gas and energy companies in the run up to Saturday's well flagged announcement by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). And yet there's been a rout on Gulf stock markets today (Sunday is a full trading day in the Middle East). In fact, the Tadawul All Share Index in Riyadh has halved since the summer of 2014 when oil prices started their precipitous fall from $115 to $29 per barrel. Although Gulf nations are petroleum-based economies, listed companies in most sectors were down - apart from Iran of course","404":"The selfie stick has become so common that it is now widely seen as a nuisance - it has been banned from stadiums, concerts, museums and even from the next Apple conference. And yet it was once considered so unnecessary that it was included in the book of 101 Un-Useless Japanese Inventions - along with dust slippers for cats and the hydrophobe's bath body suit (for taking a bath without getting wet). Un-useless inventions, also known as chindogu, are the brainchild of Kenji Kawakami, who defines them as things that are almost completely useless, but not quite. \"If you invent something which turns out to be so handy that you use it all the time, then you have failed to make a chindogu. Try the Patent Office,\" says the website chindogu.com. An early selfie stick, perhaps the first, was invented in the 1980s by Hiroshi Ueda. At the time he worked for the Minolta camera company, and was a keen photographer. \"Whenever I went overseas I took my camera with me and took loads of photos,\" he says. But while travelling in Europe he encountered a problem. He was keen to get pictures of himself and his wife together - but passers-by couldn't always be trusted. \"When I was in the Louvre Museum in Paris, I asked a child to take a photo of us, but when I stepped away, the child ran away with my camera,\" he says. It was a problem crying out for a solution - and as an engineer in Minolta's development department, Ueda was well-placed to find one. He came up with the \"extender stick\" - an extendable stick with a tripod screw that was designed for use with a new, small, camera. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. \"The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked,\" says Ueda. The concept encountered some resistance - Minolta's testing department found that women in particular were \n\n### Don\u2019t waste time\n\nGet a verified expert to help you.","405":"- The former governor of the Mexican state of Veracruz, Javier Duarte, has been charged with organised crime and money laundering and has been accused of stealing 200m pesos ($9.7m; \u00a37.6m) from the state's public funds.\n- He has disappeared and police are searching for him.\n- Officers searching his luxury ranch seized 17 paintings believed to be by famous artists such as Joan Miro, Fernando Botero and Leonora Carrington.\n- The works of art will be auctioned off to finance a children's hospital.\n- The ranch has 25 rooms, a helicopter landing pad, two tennis courts and extensive grounds just outside the city of Cordoba, in north-eastern Veracruz.","406":"1.

This is the first time the country has not had a GDP target since 1990 when records began. The announcement was made by Premier Li Keqiang at the start of the country's annual parliament meeting. The world's second largest economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter from a year ago as lockdowns paralysed businesses. \u201cThis is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,\u201d Premier Li said. The country's leadership has promised to boost economic support measures amid growing concerns that rising unemployment could threaten social stability. The move comes as tensions between Beijing and Washington are becoming increasingly strained over the coronavirus pandemic, trade and Hong Kong. On Thursday, President Donald Trump stepped up his attacks on China, suggesting that the country's leader, Xi Jinping, is behind a \u201cdisinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe.\u201d It came as Mr Trump and other Republicans have escalated their criticism of Beijing's handling of the early stages of the outbreak.

Welsh government guidance does not set limits on numbers but insists attendees stay 2m (6ft 6ins) apart. The current situation has created a \"mishmash of different approaches to the funeral process\". Some crematoria have stopped attendances at funerals, so you just have a direct cremation with no-one there. Mourners are prevented from comforting and supporting one another in traditional ways, exacerbating bereaved families' distress. Mrs Barrett called on the government to \"look seriously at non-attendance funerals, if only for a few weeks\". She urged bereaved families to \"focus on the future\" and organize memorial services once the outbreak has subsided. Funeral director Dean Thomas, from Caerphilly, echoed these concerns. Different councils are interpreting the guidance differently, so families are having to decide how many people can attend a funeral, who can and can't attend, at a very difficult time for them.","422":"In summary, Duchy the cat was fatally injured near its owner's home in Heswall, Merseyside, on Friday night.

Last Wednesday they hunkered down in secure rooms, seeking refuge from an invasion of Congress in which five people died. Some Republicans were not wearing masks during the ordeal, footage suggests. Video shared by Punchbowl News shows several lawmakers apparently refusing facemasks offered to them. However, CBS pictures from inside the chamber show Ms Jayapal was herself not wearing a mask at one point. Medical experts fear more lawmakers may have contracted the disease, potentially amounting to a super-spreader event at a time when coronavirus infections and deaths continue to rise in the US. The US has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections (22.6 million) and deaths (367,000) in the world, with no sign of the epidemic abating, despite the limited roll-out of vaccines. Over the weekend, top congressional doctor Brian Monahan told lawmakers and congressional staff who sheltered together from the riots to get tested. \"The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others,\" Mr Monahan said. \"During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection.\" Mr Monahan did not say how many lawmakers were in the room, but called on them to observe social-distancing measures and wear masks. New Jersey Democratic Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman was the first lawmaker to confirm she had tested positive on Monday. In a tweet, the 75-year-old cancer survivor said she was resting at home with \"mild, cold-like symptoms\". Ms Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, and Illinois congressman Mr Schneider revealed they had tested positive on Tuesday. All three Democrats accused Republican lawmakers of refusing to wear masks as they huddled together for safety last Wednesday. \"Any member who refuses to wear a mask should be fully held accountable for endangering our lives,\" Ms Jayapal wrote, calling for \n\nAuthor:\n\nPublication Date:\n\nReporter Name:","430":"The Scottish government is planning to introduce a consultation on the use of fireworks. The move follows increased concern over anti-social behavior linked to their use. The consultation will begin next year and will focus on measures to reduce the misuse of fireworks. The feedback will influence ongoing discussions with the UK government about legislation governing the sale of fireworks, which is currently reserved. Community safety minister Ash Denham said that many people enjoy attending fireworks displays, but there is growing concern about the use and sale of fireworks to individuals. The hard work of the police and fire services helped to reduce the number of bonfire night incidents this year, but there were still a number of concerning reports.

Neither deaths were initially deemed as suspicious by Sussex Police. Ms Nicholson's parents are challenging the senior West Sussex coroner over the scope of a new inquest. Trigg, 54, was jailed for life in 2017 for the murder of Ms Nicholson and manslaughter of Ms Devlin at their homes in Worthing, West Sussex. Following the conviction, the High Court quashed the findings of accidental death in the original inquest into Ms Nicholson's death and ordered a new one. The senior coroner for West Sussex ruled it would be a short inquest, with no witnesses questioned. Her parents, Elizabeth and Peter Skelton, want the new inquest to investigate if police failed to adequately protect their daughter. They argue that there should be a full inquest under Article Two - the right to life - of the Human Rights Act, which can scrutinise the role of public bodies in a person's death. Mr Skelton said before the hearing: \"I see this hearing as an opportunity to make sure that there is a proper inquiry into whether Susan's death could have been prevented.\" In a written submission to the High Court, Heather Williams QC said the coroner's decision was unlawful as it was \"plainly arguable\" that Sussex Police had breached its duties to protect Ms Nicholson and to effectively investigate the death Ms Devlin. Officers had been called to Ms Nicholson's flat six times in the weeks before her death over reports of violence, and one of his former partners was taken to hospital after he attacked her. But the force did not find the similarities between the cases suspicious and treated Trigg as a bereaved partner rather than a suspect. At least two police officers were involved in the investigations into both women's deaths and were aware of his connection to the cases. In 2011, coroner Michael Kendall ruled Ms Nicholson had died accidentally after Tri","432":"The article is about a British man who died in a motorbike accident in Brazil, leaving behind a wife and two children.

The family said they only found out about the accident on 20 April through a hostel owner Mr Peck mentioned before he lost consciousness. This man was contacted by the Brazilian authorities and in turn called relatives in the UK, who informed a local police officer, who notified the family. His family said they had not been able to get in touch with him since the accident, and they had not received any information from the authorities about his condition. They had been trying to contact him for weeks, but had not been able to get in touch with him. The family said they were devastated by the news of his death.

The greater and lesser horseshoe bats are doing particularly well, while the brown long-eared bat and the serotine bat are apparently not doing quite so well. However, the figures carried some caveats, such as natural year-on-year variability, insufficient data for some species, and the difficulty of detecting some bats because of their behaviour or the similarity of their calls.

The Chief Constable Debbie Simpson said the force is \"in the process of trying to re-negotiate the contract\" to open the custody suite at Poole on a part-time basis when demand is high. The Police and Crime Commissioner Martyn Underhill said the contracts had become \"white elephants\" and that they were \"locked into PFI contracts that were signed at a time of growing police forces and growing police numbers, and now we are in a shrinking environment and a shrinking estate.\" He also said that there are two buildings in Dorset which he is \"locked into to retaining for over a decade\" which are lying empty. The article further discusses the possibility of opening the custody suite at Poole on a part-time basis when demand is high, as officers are \"queuing\" to get through the custody block at Bournemouth and are also wasting time due to congestion. \"It can take officers up to an hour to drive to the cell block because they are stuck in traffic,\" he said.

He has developmental problems and has been diagnosed with autism and communication difficulties. Christine says that Tristram needs 24-hour-a-day supervision and cannot cross a road by himself. Christine loves her son but feels sad about the challenges he faces. Christine says she felt angry when she realized they had known about the problems of the medication when she was prescribed it. Problems with sodium valproate, commonly known by the brand names Epilim, Episenta and Depakote, were first identified in the 1970s but restrictions were not placed on its use until two years ago. Drug regulator the MHRA said up to four in 10 babies were at risk of developmental disorders if sodium valproate was taken during pregnancy and one in 10 was at risk of birth defects. All of the 17,000 women of child-bearing age prescribed sodium valproate each year in the UK should be on a pregnancy-prevention programme to ensure they are aware of the risks but campaigners and charities say this is often not the case. In July this year, Baroness Cumberlege announced the findings of her two-year review into three major long-term medical problems, of which sodium valproate was one.

A crane was used to lift the work from the wall on Friday afternoon. It is not clear whether it has been removed for sale but gallery owner John Brandler said when he was offered it he told the owner to give it to Bristol. The mural, which was claimed by Banksy on Instagram shortly after it appeared, was spotted at the bottom of one of the steepest streets in the UK, Vale Street, on 12 December. When viewed with the road level, it looks as if the woman's sneeze is blowing the houses over. Since December, it has attracted a regular stream of visitors - up to 100 a day. In Nottingham, Banky's mural depicting a girl hula-hooping with a bicycle tire, was removed after being sold to Mr Brandler for a \"six-figure sum\". He said when the previous owner of the house in Totterdown contacted him about the mural, he told them it was a \"poison chalice\". \"I actually advised the previous owner to give it to the corporation of Bristol or to an art museum,\" he added. \"My personal view is that I think the house has been sold and the new people have moved in and covered it up.\" The house was in the process of being sold but Nick Makin, whose mother Aileen Martin owned it, said the sale was still going ahead, despite reports they had pulled out. He told the BBC, at the time, that he wanted the artwork to \"stay where it is\" and be protected. He also said had been \"looking at getting a covenant put into the deeds of the house\" to make sure the Banksy mural remained in place. Banksy's most recent work was on the side of Reading Prison.

The Scottish government's new nutrition guidelines aim to limit sugar intake and encourage consumption of fruit and vegetables. The school petition has been instigated by pupils Angus Beverly, 10, and 11-year-old William Dibb. The petition under the heading \"Removal of puddings from school dinner menu\" states that the puddings that they love, cooked by Mrs Moir, are the best in the world and they don't want to lose them. They also mention that Mrs Moir reduces the sugar content as much as possible and that they know that Mrs Moir reduces the sugar content as much as possible. The pupils request that the school reinstate the puddings as part of their choice for dinner. One parent, Louise Grant, 28, said that there's nothing wrong with everything in moderation. The kids get a lovely balanced diet at school, and at home too, so why shouldn't they get a small slice of cake and custard? Deputy First Minister John Swinney said in his ministerial foreword on the new healthy eating guidance that schools have a pivotal role in supporting healthier dietary choices from an early age. The food and drink options they provide and the eating and drinking habits they instil can also serve as an example for positive dietary choices for wider society. Aberdeenshire Council said in a statement that while deserts such as ice cream and custard have been removed, alternatives like brownies, muffins, gingerbread, and cookies are now available. However, the council's focus is currently on healthy eating as well as using the very best produce available in Aberdeenshire and Scotland to provide pupils with nutritious and delicious meals at affordable prices. The council has not received the petition yet. A spokesman added that the change was a result of a review of the menus, which was carried out in consultation with a number of stakeholders, including parents and pupils.

But, intriguingly, they also suggest that prandial protocol is governed by a strict set of rules about discussing controversial issues.

Failure to regulate it was described on Wednesday as \u201cone of the biggest scandals\u201d politicians had encountered since devolution. The scheme was supposed to encourage firms to switch from using oil and gas. They were encouraged to use renewable biomass boilers burning woodchip instead, but an overgenerous subsidy payment meant businesses piled in. With 20 years of guaranteed payments and the bulk of the money to be paid out of the Stormont budget, it has left taxpayers with a huge bill. Responsibility for overseeing the scheme was split between the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and officials from Ofgem E-Serve. The latter organisation administers government green energy schemes across the UK. Senior members of Ofgem E-Serve appeared before the assembly's Public Accounts Committee on Wednesday. They revealed there were no minutes taken of formal meetings between themselves and departmental officials between August 2014 and November the following year. Minutes only began to be taken when there was a huge spike in applications ahead of a planned change in the tariff, as firms rushed to get in on the more lucrative terms. Chris Poulton of Ofgem E-Serve said it had \u201cflagged up\u201d the lack of cost controls in the scheme, but the department had decided not to introduce them. An initial slow uptake in early years was followed by a huge spike in applications in Autumn 2015. SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said it was clear both the department and regulator had been \u201casleep at the wheel\u201d. \u201cWe can hardly afford to fund the health service, and now we\u2019re having to fork out for this,\u201d he said.\n\nTextbook:\n\nPage 650:\n\n5.

This follows the news last week that 3,500 troops had been drafted in to plug gaps after private security firm G4S failed to recruit enough guards for the Games. In the Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May answered an urgent question on Olympics security from shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper saying that it was \"untrue\" that ministers knew last year that there would be a shortfall in the numbers of security personnel they had been promised. \"G4S repeatedly assured us that they would overshoot their targets,\" she said. Mrs May said the government had taken immediate action after becoming aware of the shortage last Wednesday. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison said: \"Whilst some of the activity police officers are undertaking was not anticipated, plans were put in place to allow us to do this. \"Forces are making sure they make the best use of their resources locally to do all they can to minimise the impact on local policing.\" The forces involved include Dorset, Surrey, Hertfordshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Strathclyde, West Midlands, Thames Valley Police, and Greater Manchester Police.

The European side for the moment is still acting as if what we've seen so far this week is just the posturing and chest-beating you see at the pre-fight weigh-in rather than the fight itself. Their big-hitters - politicians like the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and his equivalent at the European Council Donald Tusk - have confined themselves to a little nifty defensive work pointing to the likely difficulty of the talks, hoping for a fair outcome and reiterating that until Britain formally triggers the departure process everything is mere shadow boxing. None of that of course will stop individual MEPs and commentators from offering their assessment of where the balance lies between the EU and the UK after Theresa May's Brexit declaration. Brexit at-a-glance: What we learned from Theresa May Why Brexit is still undefined One German colleague said to me jokingly: \"I didn't realise that the EU had decided to leave the UK until I heard your prime minister's speech.\" And elsewhere in the corridors of the European Parliament you heard plenty of surprise at the confidence of the tone coming from London, the crispness of the decision to leave the single market and the sudden shafts of clarity after weeks in which the UK had appeared to not know what it wanted. That's not to say of course that everyone has been impressed, even though Mrs May was praised in some quarters both for realism and for clarity. It's worth remembering that most mainstream politicians in Europe view Brexit as an act of madness to be spoken of with hostility and incomprehension. Britain in this analysis has taken the decision to walk away from an institution that's been an engine of peace and prosperity.

But the BJP stopped short of a majority in Delhi after a surprise strong showing by the new Aam Aadmi Party. The polls are seen as a key test for the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP, ahead of 2014's general elections. The only state where the Congress has won is Mizoram in the north-east. The party has won 28 of the 40 seats and is leading in one more. The vote-counting is still going on there. In Rajasthan, the BJP won 162 assembly seats, leaving the Congress, which had been in power in the state, with just 21 seats. The BJP also retained power in the central states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. It won 165 seats against the 58 for Congress in Madhya Pradesh. But the contest was much closer in Chhattisgarh where the BJP won 49 seats - just three more than the majority needed to form a government - and the Congress finished its tally at 39. The Congress party also lost control of Delhi's 70-seat assembly. With 31 seats, the BJP fell just four short of a majority to form a government in the capital after a surprise strong showing by a new anti-corruption Aam Admi Party (AAP) or Common Man's Party. The AAP, led by former civil servant Arvind Kejriwal and born out of a strong anti-corruption movement that swept India two years ago, won 28 seats in the Delhi assembly elections.

Once a close ally of President Jacob Zuma, Mr. Malema has become a fierce critic. His supporters threw stones at police who were blocking them in Johannesburg. The police erected a steel gate and barbed wire to close the main street leading to Luthuli House, the African National Congress headquarters where the hearing was held. Thousands of Mr. Malema\u2019s supporters remained outside for much of the day, chanting and setting rubbish on fire. Some set on fire a T-shirt emblazoned with President Zuma\u2019s face, while other shouted \u201cZuma must go\u201d. The ANC later said the hearing would be moved to a secret location outside the city to reduce disruption, while Mr. Malema urged his supporters to show restraint. One police officer and several journalists were injured in the clashes. \u2018Kingmaker\u2019 Mr. Malema, who is charged along with five other top youth league officials, could be expelled from the ANC at the closed-door hearing. He was put on probation by the disciplinary committee last year after being found guilty of criticising Mr. Zuma.

She had said she would kill herself if sent to a male prison. Justice Department minister Lord Faulks said the policy regarding transgender prisoners was currently under review. \"Recent events have shown that placing transwomen in male estates is a dangerous thing to do. Transprisoners should be housed in the estate of their acquired gender in the first instance, and only moved to the other estate following a thorough investigation that has ruled out all other safe alternatives,\" said Baroness Barker. Labour peer, and former EastEnders actor, Lord Cashman called for a review of the situation of all transpeople in jail, saying they should be moved to \"appropriate prisons according to their acquired gender in order to avoid a repeat of the tragedy that befell Vikki Thompson\". The death of Ms Thompson led to a review of the government's policy on the care of transgender prisoners.

However, the company said this would only be a temporary solution and that the planned closures were the only way to avoid insolvency and immediate closure. The government has said it is reviewing the report and \"any use of taxpayers money has to represent clear value for money\".

The man collapsed on the course and was taken to the University Hospital of Wales where he died. The Run 4 Wales chief executive Matt Newman said the man's family was being supported. The runner was seen by a medical emergency team on the course then taken to the University Hospital of Wales where he died. \"Everyone at Run 4 Wales is devastated,\" Mr Newman said. \"It's terribly sad news... not just our thoughts but our support is with the family at this really difficult time,\" he told BBC Radio Wales. \"It was an incident at the finish line, yards away from the primary medical centre so it was an instant response.\" Mr Newman added Run 4 Wales had worked to raise awareness of unknown heart conditions following the deaths of two men at last year's event. \"We've done an incredible amount of work in terms of raising the profile... flagging that anyone that had any symptoms or history in their family or felt unwell in the run up to it that they would go to the doctor, they would get checked out and no one would come to the start line with any risk to their health. \"We can only reiterate that really, it's cast obviously a big shadow on what was otherwise a very good day for Cardiff. \"We've had 16 years and until last year we hadn't had incidents of this kind, they have happened before in big events, unfortunately it is something that does happen when you get this volume of people running.\" Mr Newman encouraged anyone intending to embark on an event like the half marathon to have a health check first. No more details about the person's identity have been revealed, with more statements to be made \"in due course\". In 2018, Ben McDonald, 25, from Cardiff, and Dean Fletcher, 32, from Exeter, went into cardiac arrest and died after crossing the finishing line at the half marathon within three minutes of each other. No inquests took place, and a coroner's investigation found the pair died of natural causes.

He said a German-Turkish journalist detained by Turkey was a \"German agent\" and a member of the outlawed Kurdish militant group, the PKK. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she respected local authorities' decisions to cancel rallies that Turkey's justice and economy ministers had been scheduled to address. Turkey is trying to woo ethnic Turkish voters ahead of a key referendum. The constitutional changes would boost Mr Erdogan's presidency and significantly weaken parliament's role. Turkish officials have been angered after local German officials withdrew permission for rallies in Gaggenau, Cologne and Frechen. Gaggenau authorities had said there was insufficient space for the rally, while Cologne officials said they had been misled about the purpose of the event.\n\nTurkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, who had been due to speak in Gaggenau, said he saw \"old illnesses flaring up\" between the two Nato allies. Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused the German government of backing opposition to Mr Erdogan's planned constitutional changes. He said: \"You are not Turkey's boss. You are not a first class [country] and Turkey is not second class. We are not treating you like that, and you have to treat Turkey properly. \"If you want to maintain your relations with us, you have to learn how to behave.\" Germany's foreign ministry said the central government had nothing to do with the cancellations, and Ankara should refrain from \"pouring oil on the fire\". The growing row is troubling for Chancellor Merkel because she persuaded Turkey to help block the surge of migrants - many of them Syrian refugees - into the EU. Separately, Mr Erdogan's government said it was considering a move to re-introduce the death penalty, after voters in the country approved a referendum that would give the president greater powers. Mr Erdogan called the referendum a victory for democracy, but the opposition said the outcome was marred by allegations of fraud.","473":"Summary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:\n\nSummary:","474":"This article discusses William Hague's new home in Wales, Cyfronydd Hall.

She provides examples of the Shanghai Bund stampede and the parents of children killed in the Sichuan earthquake, where the government has harassed the families to absolve the authorities, shun the media, and stifle their questions about what went wrong. Gracie suggests that this is a habit that needs to be broken and that treating victims like dangerous subversives is not the way to bridge the trust deficit with citizens in times of crisis.\n\nThe article then moves on to discuss the battle of the flags between China and Taiwan, and how the United States was caught in the middle. Taiwanese press reports suggested that the American government had agreed to the flag-raising ceremony as long as it was low key, but after Beijing's protest, a State Department spokeswoman said the US government did not know about the flag raising, did not agree to it, did not attend and was disappointed. At which point, Taiwan had to eat humble pie and express regret for causing embarrassment.\n\nThe article concludes with Venezuela's president, Nicolas Maduro, coming cap in hand to China for loans to offset a dangerous slump back home. China is already Venezuela's largest creditor, having lent $50bn over the past eight years. So how much more would Beijing be prepared to give now for the sake of influence in the region? Answer $20bn, according to Mr Maduro.","476":"1. The disappearance of two young golden eagles in Scotland is being investigated by police.\n2.

The project to reopen the pool has faced opposition from local residents due to concerns over car parking. The project has been granted planning permission by Ipswich Borough Council, but the developers, Fusion Lifestyle, must consider the impact of car parking in the area. The developers plan to reopen the pool in 2020 if they receive a grant of \u00a33.3 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) next month. The Broomhill Pool Trust, which has been campaigning for the lido to reopen for 15 years, is \"absolutely delighted\" that the project has passed this \"major milestone\". Under the plans, the Grade II-listed pool's water will be heated to \"take the chill off\", and the architects plan to restore the original Wicksteed diving boards. The original lido was heated, but during World War Two the boilers were removed for the war effort and never replaced. The lido's Wicksteed diving boards will be restored, and the facility will also include a fitness centre, new changing rooms, and a small refreshment area. Peter Gardiner, chairman of the planning committee, said it would be \"great\" to see the pool where he learned to swim as a boy reopened.

The court documents also say that she claimed her income was less than $500, but she deposited $84,000 in her bank account without reporting it. She may serve a maximum of 15 years in prison and be made to repay the funds. The case began when an investigator from the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services learned Ms Dolezal had published a memoir, In Full Color. The investigation discovered Ms Dolezal would probably have received \u201cpayments of $10,000 to $20,000 as advances against later royalties,\u201d according to documents. Ms Dolezal had been reporting her monthly income as less than $500, claiming food and childcare assistance funds as a result. In 2015, Ms Dolezal quit her post at the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) amid outrage that she had pretended to be African American. Since then, she claimed, she had been unable to find work, according to the Spokesman-Review. Documents show Ms Dolezal said she was \u201cbarely\u201d getting by, \u201cwith help from friends and gifts\u201d.

And opposition members defeated the government to call for \"urgent action\" after a debate on Wednesday. Education Secretary John Swinney said a wide range of subjects was available, and that exam passes were on the up. But all four opposition parties united to reject his amendment and pass the Conservative motion for the debate. The Scottish Parliament's education committee is conducting an inquiry into whether teenagers have a wide enough choice of subjects in school, amid claims this may be narrowing. A recent report by the Reform Scotland think-tank said there had been a \"sharp reduction\" in subjects available at National 4 and 5 level. And the committee has now released the results of its own surveys on the subject - although because they were conducted online and were self-selecting, they are not necessarily representative of all pupils and parents across the country. A total of 241 pupils and 375 parents took part in the surveys. Of these, 56% of the pupils who responded said they had not been able to take all of the subjects they wanted to, while 76% of parents said this had been the case with their children. The parents who responded highlighted music as the subject most likely to be missed out on, while pupils complained most frequently about not being able to take modern studies. The most common reasons cited for classes not being available were: 'Useless subjects' One pupil said they were not allowed to take modern studies, so \"had to take art instead, which I hated\", while another said they were \"forced to take Spanish, a course I have no interest in, and miss a class I really enjoy\". Another wrote that the range of choice \"led me to take useless subjects as filler for my timetable, which led to a lot of wasted time\".

IS imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people, carried out countless atrocities, destroyed cultural heritage, and generated billions of dollars in revenue from oil, extortion, robbery, and kidnapping. After five years of fierce and bloody battles, local forces, backed by world powers, have driven IS out of all the territory it once controlled. However, the group is by no means defeated. Experts say it will return to its insurgent roots while rebuilding and remains a global threat.\n\nWhat does IS want? IS is what is widely known as a jihadist group. Jihadists see violent struggle as necessary to eradicate obstacles to restore God's rule on Earth and defend the Muslim community against what they consider to be infidels and apostates. IS wants a \"caliphate\" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth (caliph) - that extends across the Islamic world. The group justifies its attacks on Muslims and non-Muslims alike by drawing on extreme interpretations of Islamic texts.\n\nWhat are its origins? IS grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was formed by Sunni Muslim militants after the US-led invasion in 2003. In 2011, the group - by then known as Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) - joined the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, where it found a safe haven. It also took advantage of the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and Sunni anger at the sectarian policies of its Shia-led government. In 2013, ISI began seizing territory in Syria and changed its name to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis\/Isil). The next year Isis overran large parts of Iraq, proclaimed its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as caliph, and became known as \"Islamic State\".\n\nHow much land did it control?

The president acknowledged Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \"could very well\" have known about Khashoggi's murder. \"In any case, our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\" he added. Mr Khashoggi was murdered on 2 October on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing on rogue agents but denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. US media have reported that the CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. Mr Trump's statement said: \"[It] could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that the CIA had not made a \"100%\" determination on the killing. In an interview on Sunday, the president told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it \"a suffering tape\".

But, it's also what they expected, and what they've always said about President Trump - he will be a true friend of the Kingdom. Both sides want to draw a line under this major crisis - and global outcry. But, as Mr Trump acknowledged, and Saudis know, it won't go away. Not for many in the US Congress, as well as for many others, including countries who will continue to call for greater clarity. Many Saudis say they don't believe their country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman, would have ordered such a despicable act.

Le Rocquier School head Richard Rolfe said focusing on academic success could mean less time being spent on sports, the arts and vocational subjects. He said many of his school's subjects could end up being under threat. Mr Rolfe said: \"The dangers are, and I'm thinking very carefully about this, you end up trying to jump through hoops to claw your way up a league table and the victims are the children, families and the curriculum because it becomes narrowed. \"We've introduced electrical work, we've got children who can wire a whole ringmain, we've got plumbing, we've got carpentry, we've got catering and all of those would have to go.\" Vulnerable children Mr Rolfe said lower grades were to be expected at the four States non-selective secondary schools because of the way the education system works. He said putting pressure on schools to achieve better exam results could leave them reluctant to educate the most vulnerable children, adding that parents should look beyond exam results to the whole ethos of a school. In February concerns were raised that past exam results showed pupils in States secondary schools achieved lower grades than most teenagers in the UK. Jersey's education department released the headline results on Thursday but said it would take up to eight weeks to release individual school performances. A Freedom of Information request revealed in February that state secondary schools performed worse at GCSEs than almost all UK schools.

The reliance of Russia on tax revenues from the oil industry makes it particularly sensitive to price movements. Household disposable incomes are also forecast to decline by as much as 2.8%, compared with a previous estimate of 0.4% growth. The sharp revision in Russia's economic forecast is the first admission from the government that the economy will contract. \"The current prognosis is based on a drop in GDP by 0.8% in 2015, against the previous prognosis of growth by 1.2%,\" deputy prime minister Alexi Vedev said. Budget On Monday, the rouble suffered its biggest one-day fall since 1998, declining almost 9% against the dollar before rallying after suspected central bank intervention. The currency has already lost 40% in value this year. The Russian finance ministry has not ruled out spending more than 500 billion roubles from the budget's Reserve Fund next year. The 2015-2017 budget allows for spending of up to 500bn roubles (\u00a35.9bn) next year from the Reserve Fund, but Maxim Oreshkin, head of the finance ministry's long-term strategic planning department, said it was possible the government could spend more to support the economy. He added that if the average oil price were $80 per barrel in 2015, the finance ministry's forecast for a fall in GDP was in line with the economy ministry's prediction of a 0.8% contraction. He also said that a scenario in which the oil price averaged $60 a barrel in 2015 was pessimistic, and at that price, the Russian economy would contract as forecast in the central bank's \"stress scenario\".

RSPB Scotland's Calum Murray said the charity had to prioritise based on the needs of species and habitats. However, he said it would continue to monitor numbers and support nature-based tourism through other projects. The story of the trail dates back to 2001 when red kites were locally extinct in Dumfries and Galloway. A re-introduction campaign was started which ran until 2005. The kite trail was founded in October 2003 as a wildlife viewing initiative aimed at raising public awareness of the birds and promoting the region as a tourist destination. One of its goals was to help the recovery after the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 with studies showing it has contributed millions of pounds to the economy. It has also seen numbers thrive with more than 1,000 chicks fledged since the project began and now 130 breeding pairs across the area. RSPB Scotland said that thanks to the initiative - and other successful re-introductions across the UK - the red kite had gone from being a red-listed bird, the highest level of conservation concern, to a green-listed bird, the lowest level. The charity said incidents of illegal persecution against kites were still recorded, but their population was \"stable and growing\". Mr Murray - a community liaison officer for more than 12 years - said that meant the time was right for the charity to step back. \"The Galloway Kite Trail has been a huge part of my life, and it's been a privilege to be involved in something so worthwhile, with so many tangible and knock-on benefits for wildlife and for people,\" he said. \"It's also been a pleasure working with the businesses and landowners involved, who have all contributed to the trail's success as a visitor attraction and will, I'm sure, continue to support it. \"It's definitely sad to be stepping back, but as a conservation charity, the RSPB has to prioritise its efforts based on the needs of spe","492":"The article focuses on a report that examines statistics to look at how the virus has hit different parts of the population in Wales and across the UK. The report states that the virus seemed to spread into Wales by travelling along major routes from England, along the M4 from Bristol, and from Chester and Liverpool. It questions whether this extra time to prepare and lock down could be one reason why there were proportionally fewer deaths in Wales than in England. The review examines Office of National Statistic figures which, unlike Public Health Wales' daily figures, include all deaths in care homes and people's own homes. They also include deaths of people suspected by doctors of having coronavirus, not just confirmed cases. It says that between 1 March and 31 May, 2,257 people in Wales died with coronavirus. The percentage of excess deaths, which compare all deaths to an average over previous years, was 24% in Wales in the equivalent period.

The average annual dual fuel bill will increase to \u00a31,271. This is a 9% rise, and comes just days after British Gas and Npower said they were raising prices. Scottish Power blames the price increase on increased costs, such as the cost of transporting gas and electricity to customers' homes, and of energy efficiency programmes. Consumer groups have often argued that energy firms raise prices in packs. Scottish Power said it had to increase prices for customers because the cost of transporting gas and electricity to customers' homes, and of energy efficiency programmes, had risen. Customers will see a gas and electricity price increase of 8.7%. Those who pay by cash and cheque every quarter will see prices rise by 1.4%. Meanwhile, those on prepayment meters, which are often those with financial difficulties, will see a price rise of 8.6%. However, these meters have greater running costs for energy firms. Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch, said some customers could ration their energy usage as a result. Other price rises The reasons for the price rise echoed the views last week of British Gas managing director Phil Bentley, who claimed that 85% of the price it charged to customers was outside its control. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, announced a 9.2% rise in its prices.

This includes prohibiting any actions or statements that could influence a jury\u2019s decision. The law applies to everyone, including journalists, social media users, and even jurors. Contempt of court carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison and an unlimited fine. The 1981 Contempt of Court Act sets out the rules for contempt. Contempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing \u201cactive\u201d criminal proceedings. Active proceedings begin when a suspect is arrested. Someone could also be in contempt by taking photographs or film, recording what is said in court, or talking to a jury member about a case. Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was found guilty of contempt of court for broadcasting a live video outside Leeds Crown Court in May 2018. The video showed defendants accused of sexual exploitation, and the broadcast was seen by thousands of people. The court found that the defendants in the case were subject to reporting restrictions, which prevented the publication of any details of the case until the end of a series of linked trials. The manner in which Robinson filmed the defendants was also a problem, as it could have influenced those on bail not to co-operate with the trial. The aggressive confrontation could have also impeded justice over a sexual grooming gang\u2019s trial. Robinson was originally jailed for 13 months for contempt of court.\n\nSummary:\nIn conclusion, the law of contempt of court is an important part of ensuring that people receive a fair trial. It applies to everyone, and carries serious consequences for those who break it. The case of Tommy Robinson highlights the seriousness of contempt of court and the consequences that can follow from it.","495":"In China, a woman carrying a kitchen knife entered a school in Banan district and attacked students in the playground. The motive for the attack is unclear, but some reports on social media claim the woman had a grievance against the government. The woman, whose surname was Liu, was arrested at the scene. Video circulating on social media shows injured children being led out of the school, some of them with knife wounds to their faces. Other footage appears to show police taking the alleged attacker away. Police have denied media reports that two children died, urging people not to pass on \"rumours\". Violent crime is relatively rare in China, but it has faced a string of unrelated knife attacks in school and kindergartens in recent years. They have usually been carried out by people seeking revenge against officials or individuals, or who are suffering from mental health problems. In April, nine middle school students died when a 28-year-old man attacked them as they were on their way home. He reportedly claimed he had been bullied at the school as a child. He was executed in September.\n\n## Summary Analysis\n\nUser rating: 4.73 (11 votes)","496":"The Cheltenham Playhouse Theatre had applied for \u00a350,000 in funding to help it through the coronavirus pandemic but said it \"didn't get anything at all\".

In the voicemail, Naylor used swearing and said he wanted to \"kill\" Mr Corbyn. When interviewed by police, Naylor said he had no political stance and believed Mr Corbyn was the leader of the Liberal Democrats party. In court, Naylor said he did not know any politicians and could not remember making the call, which was made on the anniversary of his mother's death.

The BBC car-review show has been running since 1977 and is broadcast in more than 200 countries and territories, reaching over 350 million viewers. However, China has managed to hold out against Top Gear\u2019s quest for complete global domination and has remained a Top-Gear-free-zone. Until now.\n\nBut when the first episode of Top Gear finally made it onto Chinese screens last week, there was something missing. China has gone for a presenter line-up with - how shall we put this - a little less mileage on the clock. The Top Gear Three, described as many things over the years but never \u201cyouthful\u201d, have been replaced with a far more polished trio. Cheng Lei, the new Clarkson, is a well-manicured Dragon TV host, all suits and sharp waistcoats. As for his two sidekicks, Ren Xianqi is an actor, singer and racing driver and Tian Liang is an Olympic diving gold medallist. There is not an un-tucked shirt or an un-kempt hair-do in sight. But what about the content itself and the some of those key qualities - the irreverence and occasional ability to offend - for which the UK version is so loved and sometimes loathed? Will they too be polished away?\n\nFans of the show will be relieved to know that the same grungy studio is still there, as is the laddish banter and the sense of pure, petrol fuelled fun. There's a Chinese Stig - the mystery, white-helmeted test-track driver - and the Star-in-a-Reasonably-Priced Car feature remains, allowing the Chinese version, if the first episode is anything to go by, to lean even more heavily on celebrity guests.\n\nThe point of making local-versions of TV shows is that it allows audiences to connect with them more intimately, without the need for subtitles or voice-overs, and it allows the programme makers to better tailor the content to the local audience. The Chinese version of Top Gear, for example, features a segment on electric cars, as part of the government's"},"prompt":{"0":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It was opened in 2002, nearly three years behind schedule, but closed three years later. Work continues to remove the remaining rubble and steel girders from the site, which is expected to open as a new outdoor events space in the summer. 'Truly wonderful' As the last section of the building's final wall came down, John and Jean Fellows, who live nearby, told BBC News they were happy their sea views had been restored. \"We can see the whole seafront and across the Purbecks from our 6th floor flat without the view being obscured now - truly wonderful,\" Mrs Fellows said. Mr Fellows added: \"It was a monstrosity and should never have been built in the first place. A total waste of money.\" Theresa Wright, 41, who lives in Poole and works in Bournemouth, said: \"I think there's been a lot of hype about it really. \"I don't think the building was as bad as everyone made out. I thought, as a structure, it looked okay but, admittedly, it was perhaps in the wrong setting.\" In 2010, the council bought the leasehold for the site and wanted to lower the building's height to reclaim views, but received \"no suitable bids\" from developers. Instead, the authority decided to build a new seafront entertainment space on the site and The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra and Pavilion Dance have already expressed an interest in staging performances there. Preparation work to dismantle the structure, voted one of the UK's most hated buildings in 2005 on the Channel 4 programme Demolition, began in October. The demolition has involved the removal of 3,000 tonnes of steel and 8,000 tonnes of concrete.

Mr Nicklinson wanted somebody to actually kill him without being prosecuted. He lost his High Court case last week, around the same time he started to refuse food. The life he described as a \"living nightmare\" came to end on Wednesday. But despite his failure in the courts, will Tony Nicklinson change the way society views the \"right to die\"? Mr Nicklinson's case certainly sparked large amounts of personal sympathy, even from people who disagreed with him ideologically. His despair, captured on film when the High Court decision was announced, gave a moving insight into the torment of a life locked inside your own body. But can one person sway opinion on \"right-to-die\" cases - especially when many people have firm views on either sides of the debate? 'Parliament to decide' The courts acknowledged his circumstances were \"deeply moving\". However, they were adamant in their judgment that it was not their job to decide if the law on assisted dying should change. \"These are matters for Parliament to decide,\" Lord Justice Toulson said. There is no indication that politicians are about to take on the issue. Should a debate arise it will continue to be opposed on ethical, religious and practical grounds. The people who would be expected to perform euthanasia - doctors - are strongly opposed. The British Medical Association does not want the law changed. It said \"it does not believe that it would be in society's best interests for doctors to be able to legally end a patient's life\". Other doctors groups, such as the Royal College of Physicians, share this stance. One thing is certain though. These cases will keep on coming.

The station continued to exist, and is currently an internet and digital service. After a successful application to Ofcom, Radio Caroline has been given the medium wave frequency of 648kHz - once used by the BBC World Service. The frequency, once used to relay broadcasts to Eastern Europe, will be taken over from noon on Friday.

It has been offered to school-age girls, to protect them from cervical cancer, since 2008. However, there have been repeated calls for the vaccine to be given to all boys as well. In November 2015, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - which advises all UK governments - called for the HPV jab to be offered to gay men up to the age of 45. The JCVI said there would also be a \"substantial benefit\" in reducing the number of genital warts. Health minister Jane Ellison announced: \"Through this pilot, the HPV vaccine will be offered during existing appointments at selected GUM (sexual health) and HIV clinics in England to test delivery in these settings. \"Public Health England is in the process of agreeing which GUM and HIV clinics will take part in the pilot. \"A full roll-out of a HPV vaccination programme for men who have sex with men will be dependent on the progress and outcome of the pilot.\" The jab is also being rolled out in Wales. Dr Shaun Griffin, from the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"The announcement of this pilot feels like a cynical stalling tactic. \"Back in November, the government said that all MSM up to the age of 45 would be able to access the HPV vaccine across the country - now, six months later, we are disappointed to see this has been scaled down to a small-scale and unnecessary pilot.\" Peter Baker, from the charity HPV Action, said: \"The extension of the HPV vaccination programme to protect men has been characterised by delay after delay. \"The best way of protecting men who have sex with men, as well as all other men, is to vaccinate all adolescent boys. \"It is vital that a decision on this issue is made soon because, with every year that passes, almost 400,000 more boys are left unprotected.\" Follow James on Twitter.

Until now, MPs who wanted to install security had to apply through the parliamentary expenses watchdog Ipsa. But the BBC's Norman Smith said MPs had decided to strip the watchdog of its authority over security decisions amid concerns over delays to MPs' requests. Following a decision by the Estimates Committee of MPs on Tuesday, all MPs will automatically be offered extra security - such as panic buttons, extra lighting, additional locks and emergency fobs - and will not have to apply to have them installed. Previously, MPs wanting enhanced security arrangements had to have to a risk assessment carried out by the police and written estimates before any work could be carried out. Jo Cox died last month after being attacked in her West Yorkshire constituency, the first MP to be killed for more than 25 years. The safety of MPs outside the Houses of Parliament is the responsibility of local police forces but Ipsa has responsibility for approving funding for security procedures and dealing with requests from individual MPs. 'Providing assurance' The watchdog's chairman wrote to MPs in the aftermath of Ms Cox's death to say the way in which it handled applications would be \"reviewed and accelerated\" in response to concerns about its role. In January, the security measures available to MPs at their constituency offices and homes were \"standardised\" - to try to speed up the process and ensure all 650 members of the Commons receive a consistent service. They were divided into two packages: routine and enhanced claims. The former is based on MPs filling in self-assessment forms although MPs must obtain two separate quotes from locksmiths.

Two ministers on Friday also refused to sign off Mr Salvini's orders banning the Open Arms ship from docking in Lampedusa. In a letter on Saturday, Mr Salvini reluctantly told the prime minister he could allow the \"alleged\" minors off the vessel, before pointing out it was \"contrary to my policy\". \"Evacuation of unaccompanied minors completed,\" Open Arms tweeted. \"Many tears.

So what can the internet provide that a library can't, and when is there simply no online substitute for a trip to your local library? Here are five examples on either side: Only at a library 1. Specialist research As tempting as it is to view the web as a tool for gathering all information, there are gaps only library documents, books and maps can fill. Local and family historians as well as academic and historical researchers are among those who still rely heavily on paper and print. Historian and author Andrew Dalby, 63, who edits pages for online encyclopaedia Wikipedia from his home in France, says he still needs regularly visits to good libraries in England. \"It's amazing what you can find online and also amazing what nobody managed to produce yet,\" he says. \"Those libraries that have managed to retain older collections need to go on retaining them... we need that evidence of ingenuity, originality and inspiration that we can lose if we only look at things produced in the last few years.\" 2. Environment to learn Sometimes there's no substitute for human contact. Mr Dalby says just being in a place surrounded by books and information with help at hand to access them is invaluable. Whilst some will crave the refuge of silence libraries offer, others such as the vulnerable and isolated have a place to interact, learn and meet people.

At Darent Valley, it was 47%. Gravesham council leader John Burden said it was unacceptable. Darent Valley said it was working with ambulance trusts to minimise delays. Medway Maritime did not comment. NHS England's target is for handovers from ambulances to A&E to take place within 15 minutes. Fines of \u00a3200 can be imposed for delays over 30 minutes and \u00a31,000 for delays of over an hour but local clinical commissioning groups have not yet imposed them. South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) figures show that 51% of the 11,000 patients arriving by ambulance at Medway between April and July waited more than 15 minutes. The longest time a patient waited at Darent Valley was three hours and 55 minutes, while at Medway it was three hours and 24 minutes. 'Fairly calm period' Mr Burden said Darent Valley had been under pressure since the closure of Queen Mary's A&E department in Sidcup. \"They have got to do something about it. They have got to increase resources to make that time lower,\" he said. \"It is just not acceptable for local people.\" Unison spokesman for Secamb, Bryan Hopperton, said the union was concerned that the figures relate to a period which should be \"fairly calm\". He said problems had been caused by the troubled 111 non-emergency phone service, cuts in social care for the ageing population and a lack of provision to treat people in their homes. \"The hospitals are under extreme pressure and it's either a lack of beds or a lack of doctors and nurses,\" he said. \"It is simply the fact you've got a funnelling effect in that everybody is going in through A&E. \"It comes back to investment.\" Secamb said there were times when the NHS was extremely busy and delays could occur. \"We work closely with hospitals to ensure this time is kept to a minimum,\" it said.

American killed in Barcelona terror attack A driver rammed a car into crowds in Barcelona's tourist district, Las Ramblas, killing 13 people and injuring dozens. Hours later, police killed five terror suspects in a second vehicle attack in the town of Cambrils. A woman injured in the attack later died. Police said the men killed in Cambrils were linked to the Barcelona attack, which the Islamic State group said it had carried out. In Friday's tweets, Mr Trump lambasted \"Obstructionist Democrats\" for hindering his security plans, which appeared to refer to legal efforts to block his travel ban in US courts. On Thursday, Mr Trump condemned the attack in Spain before he urged his Twitter followers to look into General John Pershing's actions during the US war in the Philippines in the early 1900s. According to the debunked myth, the US commander rounded up 50 terrorists and ordered his men to shoot 49 of them, using bullets dipped in pig's blood. Pigs are considered ritually unclean in Islam. It is claimed the survivor was told to go back and tell his people what happened. However, historians and fact checkers say there is no truth to the story.

Sark Electricity, the island's sole power provider, said it would appeal against the \"wrong\" decision. Mr White said the current \"high price\" would encourage \"wealthier customers\" to generate their own electricity, leaving those unable to do so paying increasingly higher prices. \"I have reason to believe that lower prices will encourage demand for electricity to recover towards the levels experienced at the start of this decade,\" he added.

He also urged the firm to move towards solar and wind power. But David Gordon-Brown, the company's director, said the forced drop in prices would lead to \"negative outcomes\" for the island.

The trust said it rigorously pursued all salary overpayments. Barts Health was formed last year by the merger of Barts and The London NHS Trust and two other trusts.

They showed that during the 2010\/11 financial year, 329 salary overpayments worth \u00a3971,000 were made. In the last financial year to April 2012, \u00a3995,000 was paid in error.

Co-founders Trupti Jain and Biplab Khetan Paul have come up with an answer to this. \"During the Gujarat earthquake of 2001, I remember how temperatures rose drastically leaving people without water, followed by monsoons, which flooded everything and left farms waterlogged for months. That's when I started looking for a solution\" says Biplab. \"Later I realised that these erratic rains could be a solution for such dry seasons.\" Biplab and Trupti then started experimenting with different structures to store excess rain water so that it could be used in dry seasons. \"That's when we innovated bhungroo - a water harvesting technique that uses an injection module to store excess rain water underground. Farmers can then use the same water for irrigation during summer and winter,\" says Trupti. Encroaching deserts The high level of salinity in many regions of Gujarat and other states of India often creates an impermeable white or brown layer that prevents water from penetrating the soil, leaving the surface waterlogged. \"This standing water adds to the salinity as many minerals present in the soil also get dissolved in the water, which in the dry season creates a salty layer,\" says Biplab.

Here are a selection of reactions to the report. Ed Davey, UK Secretary of State for Energy The message of this report is clear. Greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated in recent years due to human activity. We need a large-scale change to our global energy system if we are to limit the effects of climate change. The longer we leave it, the more difficult and costly it will be. The UK is leading from the front with our European partners. We've adopted some of the most ambitious climate change targets and are investing in low carbon and energy efficiency technologies. John Kerry, US Secretary of State We've already had wake-up call after wake-up call about climate science. This report is a wake-up call about global economic opportunity we can seize today as we lead on climate change. So many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper, more readily available, and better performing than they were when the last IPCC assessment was released less than a decade ago. Good energy solutions are climate solutions and this report shines a light on energy technologies available right now to substantially reduce global emissions. These technologies can cut carbon pollution while growing economic opportunity at the same time. The global energy market represents a $6 trillion opportunity, with 6 billion users around the world. By 2035, investment in the energy sector is expected to reach nearly $17 trillion. We already know that climate science is unambiguous and that every year, the world defers action, the costs only grow. But focusing only on grim realities misses promising realities staring us right in the face. This report makes very clear we face an issue of global willpower, not capacity.

This includes showing how many visits the game has had and where the visits come from, like video reviews and Reddit posts. TotalBiscuit calls it a \"bit of a crowdsourcing system\". But Valve also wants to discover hidden gems that get buried by allowing users to become explorers. Users that opt in will be shown a list of games that failed to reach a level of exposure after being released. They'll then test them and assess their game play.

Mr Gregory, of no fixed address, absconded from a psychiatric hospital months before the attack on 18 March, the Southwark Crown Court jury heard. He pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the charge of causing \u00a310,000 of criminal damage. Prosecutors say Mr Gregory, from Kettering in Northamptonshire, is guilty because he knew what he was doing was wrong. The court heard that as security guards dragged Mr Gregory away from the painting, he shouted he had just been released from prison and would trigger a bomb. He also boasted about the attention he got from witnesses at the museum, which is on Trafalgar Square, the jury heard. The court was told Mr Gregory claimed he could pay for the damage because his father owned Queens Park Rangers football club. 'Family will find you' Nicholas Dunham told Southwark Crown Court: \"Since the incident Mr Gregory has been under psychiatric care and has been diagnosed with a mental illness, most probably paranoid schizophrenia. \"He said while standing in the National Gallery he heard a voice telling him 'put a mark on the painting and your family will find you'. \"What he said at the time and what he said afterwards, taken together, makes it clear that he knew that what he was doing was wrong.\" Mr Gregory has the belief someone will kill him and make it look like suicide, the court heard. He was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in October 2016 but absconded and had been sleeping rough for several months before the attack, the jury heard. Larry Keith, from the National Gallery, said it took restoration experts more than 80 hours to repair the painting, which dates back to 1785. He added that the slash marks could never be hidden completely and the painting had therefore fallen in value.

The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services has described the approach to care homes as \"shambolic\" as staff have struggled to get hold of the aprons, gloves and goggles needed. What has gone wrong? How well prepared was the UK? Last week England's deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, was saying during the televised daily briefing that the UK was an international \"exemplar\" for pandemic preparedness. She faced howls of derision on social media, from MPs and commentators for her comments. But it was perfectly understandable why she made such a claim. The UK has long been seen as an international leader when it comes to pandemic planning and public health. It had a stockpile of kit housed at a giant temperature-controlled warehouse in the north-west of England. There were millions of pieces of equipment, which have proved invaluable in the first few months of the pandemic. And, despite the demands placed on it, the stockpile has still not been completely used up. Nonetheless, frontline staff have found themselves in a position where they have not always had the kit they need. It is worth saying, though, that the UK is not alone in this. Many countries have faced similar problems. In France, President Macron apologised live on TV for shortcomings, including in this area. The ability to judge the preparations is also hampered by the fact the government has refused to publish the full findings of its 2016 pandemic drill named Exercise Cygnus. The three-day event, designed to test the plans, led to a series of recommendations, including some on PPE. It is unclear what short-comings were found and to what extent they were acted on.

But there is confusion around what counts. A packet of crisps? A quick pasty? Or does it need to be a main meal served at a table with knife, fork, napkin and a range of condiments? The new government guidelines state that in areas at the very high local Covid alert level, pubs and bars \"can only remain open where they operate as if they were a restaurant.\" And that means \"serving substantial meals, like a main lunchtime or evening meal. They may only serve alcohol as part of such a meal.\" But critics are pointing out that the guidelines are open to interpretation. Speaking to to Radio 1 Newsbeat, Liverpool University student Ruth Brewer says she doesn't understand what is and isn't allowed. \"Its quite confusing,\"she says. \"I literally have no idea, a substantial meal could be anything. Literally anything.\" Phil Gillespie is part of the management at Mccooley's pub in Liverpool city centre. It offers a range of food but he is concerned he might get in trouble for serving up a pint with the wrong type of meal. \"Are we then going to get penalised if someone wants to come and just wants to have a sandwich?\" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has been trying to clear this confusion up. He told radio station LBC a pasty on its own doesn't count but if you stick a salad or chips on the plate with it, you could be all right. \"If you would expect to go into that restaurant normally, or pub, and order a plated meal at the table of a Cornish pasty with chips or side salad or whatever it comes with, then that's a normal meal,\" he explained. The \"substantial meal\" concept is not actually a new one in pubs, bars and restaurants. It's an extension of the law that covers 16 and 17 year olds drinking alcohol in pubs with table meals. They are allowed to drink (but not buy) beer, wine or cider but only if they have it with a meal and an accompanying\n\nSummary:","34":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But the analysis methods that private companies use put it at \u00a310.5bn. There are concerns that such a significant hole in what is the biggest pension fund in the country could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, with 303,000 members, has assets of \u00a337.9bn - more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. By its own official estimate to members this month, that is \u00a37.9bn short of what it needs to pay pensions. Those numbers are disputed by the fund's critics who say that working it out on the formula private companies use - known as FRS17 - would put it at \u00a32.6bn higher. 'Degree of denial' Analysis for Newsnight by pensions consultant John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, showed that to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to \u00a31.8bn. That equates to a rise in tuition fees of up to \u00a31,000 a year. Mr Ralfe said: \"There is a whole degree of denial. USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. \"We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. \"There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we're doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children.\" Higher Education Minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students. \"Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits,\" he said. \"It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits to support pension schemes that are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they're older.\" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the umbrella body Universities UK, said\n\nSummary:","35":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

MPs will vote in the autumn on whether to allow an increase in tuition fees. The government will support an increase if universities can show they have high quality teaching. Announcing a higher level of fees of \u00a39,250 was attacked as \"disgraceful arrogance from some universities\" by the Liberal Democrat education spokesman John Pugh. The proposal to raise fees is \"not a done deal\", says Mr Pugh. New fee level of \u00a39,250 Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said: 'Those universities foolish enough to advertise higher fees will be doing nothing to quell concerns from students and parents that they are simply after as much cash as they can get.\" The higher level fees now being advertised are for undergraduate courses starting in autumn 2017. Students will start applying for these courses after the summer holidays. There are references on university websites to fees being \"subject to government confirmation\" and \"inflationary changes\", but this comes before MPs have voted on legislation which will link fee increases to standards of teaching. There will also be a separate vote by MPs in the autumn on whether to permit an increase in tuition fees above \u00a39,000. Under the government's proposals, if universities meet a threshold of good-quality teaching, they will be able to increase fees with inflation, which for 2017 is calculated as allowing an extra \u00a3250. 'Back door' increase At this rate, tuition fees could be over \u00a310,000 within the next four years. The plans in the Higher Education and Research Bill are before Parliament and in a debate on Tuesday, Labour's Gordon Marsden warned this inflation link meant there was no guarantee on how high fees could rise.

He said Britain was a world leader in \"boring small tunnels\". But transport campaigners want improvements now on more conventional solutions such as smart traffic lights. On Monday, a feasibility study suggested work could start in 2021 on the Cambridgeshire Autonomous Metro (CAM), using trackless electric vehicles to link the city to outlying areas. Part of the network would be underground. The CAM has been proposed by the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority and its mayor and it would provide new links from the city to St Neots, Huntingdon, St Ives, Haverhill and Mildenhall. Prof Miles, from the University of Cambridge's engineering department, told the BBC's Sunday Politics East programme that advances in vehicle technology made the CAM affordable. \"We have autonomous and electric vehicles so we can propose a trackless tram - we don't have to have rails in the ground or any overhead power cables,\" he said. \"It can all be run by batteries, just like electric buses and that makes a huge difference to the cost of these vehicles.\" The CAM could take 10 years to develop and transport campaigners want congestion solutions more quickly. \"We need to utilise the existing infrastructure instead of laying more tarmac,\" said Chris Rand of Smarter Cambridge Transport. \"There are things the mayor could do, like looking in bus franchising, which are not as glamorous, but which would really make a difference.\" Mr Rand said smart technology controlling traffic signals and bus information would also have an immediate impact.

'Very big wellies' Many flood alerts remain in place in the county, with most of the severe warnings in the south of England relating to a stretch of the Thames through Oxfordshire and Surrey. Temporary flood defences and sandbag dams are in place in west Oxford, with water pumping being carried out. Oxford City Council installed temporary toilets in Fox Crescent and Canning Crescent, off Abingdon Road, as drains were overflowing. Businesses in Abingdon Road have called for flood barriers to be installed. Mohammad Afzal, from the Nisa general store, said people could not get to his shop \"unless they wear very big wellies\". \"This is now the second time in a month this has happened, I guess we are going to have to get used to it,\" he said. \"But, we have to plan in future what we do, like rerouting the water.\" Rodney Rose, deputy leader of Oxfordshire County Council, said the flooding was as bad as in 2007.

Opposition parties and campaigners criticised the lack of a Commons debate - and accused ministers of a U-turn as they previously pledged an outright ban on fracking in national parks. The government said its plans would protect \"our most precious landscapes\". Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom also said there had already been \"enormous debate\" on the subject. Ballot papers MPs overwhelmingly rejected a bid to suspend drilling for shale gas in a Commons vote in January, during which ministers also pledged an \"outright ban\" on fracking in national parks. Labour has said the government's plans, contained in a draft regulation, represent a U-turn on this commitment, and called for stronger safeguards. The proposals, first set out in July, would only allow fracking 1,200m below national parks, Areas of Outstanding National Beauty, the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads and World Heritage Sites. The drill rigs would have to be positioned outside the boundaries of the protected areas. Q&A: What is fracking? Sites of Special Scientific Interest, which are designated to protect wildlife or geology, are not mentioned. MPs opposed the passing of the draft regulation when it was read out in the Commons on Tuesday evening. Because this happened after the conclusion of the day's main business, parliamentary rules required the vote to be deferred - until Wednesday. Under this process of so-called deferred divisions, MP voted on the proposal by filling in ballot papers with the result announced later by Deputy Speaker Natascha Engel. Shadow energy secretary Lisa Nandy accused ministers of using a \"parliamentary backdoor\" to try to approve the \"weak regulations\" without debate.

Apparently Ireland is still one of the places requesting red-haired donors along with Denmark and Germany. However, as many of Cryos clients are in Spain, Italy and Greece, there is a need for more brown-eyed Scandinavians, Mediterraneans and men of other ethnicities as donors.

Such events occur about every 30 years, but the neutrino streams they produce have not been studied in detail. Dune (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment) will be hosted at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. It will involve the development of the world's most high-intensity beam of neutrinos, which will travel 1,300km (800mi) underground from Fermilab towards a massive detector instrument based at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. The venture is the product of a merger between European and US projects with similar aims. The international collaboration held its inaugural meeting at Fermilab in April. \"There has been a process since last summer to prepare the ground for this collaboration, based on bringing together the US and European projects. There are now 700 people signed up,\" said Prof Stefan S\u00f6ldner-Rembold, from the University of Manchester. \"The step forward is a new collaboration with a new name that has commitments from the US, Europe, India and other regions to go forward.\" Neutrinos are one of some 17 elementary cosmic building blocks that make up the Universe. But they are also a source of intrigue for particle physicists. They are extremely light particles, with no electric charge and pass harmlessly through other matter. This property makes them very difficult to observe and is responsible for them being nicknamed \"ghost particles\". Neutrinos may also play a role in the mystery of why the Universe came to consist mostly of matter rather than antimatter. They are found in three different states, or flavours, and the particles can flip from one flavour to another.

Polanski, who is wanted in the US after admitting to sex with a minor in 1977, did not attend the screening. J'Accuse (An Officer and a Spy) stars Oscar-winning actor Jean Dujardin. Martel later stressed she had no \"prejudice\" against Polanski's film, and would see it after the gala premiere. The film is a historical thriller telling the true story of French Jewish army officer Alfred Dreyfus, who was falsely accused of treason in the 19th Century. Dujardin plays a French officer who uncovers evidence that Dreyfus was framed, and who risks his life to expose the truth. Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles in 1977, but then fled the US. He has also faced further allegations of sexual assault. In an interview released by festival organisers, the director drew parallels between the film's themes and his own case. \"I can see the same determination to deny the facts and condemn me for things I have not done,\" he said. \"Most of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing about the case.\" His wife, French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, who stars in the film, told a press conference that his experiences had informed his film-making. \"The feeling of persecution, I think is quite simple to understand.

In these underground chutes, a tunnel is dug and a dog is put in at one end and a captured badger in at the other. While there is no way of knowing exactly how many people are involved in badger baiting, there is a suspicion that in the recent past some events at chutes could attract large numbers of people, some coming from as far away as Scotland or the north of England to test their dogs. One source told me that on more than one occasion he had seen dogs that had left the tunnel without attacking the badger killed on the spot by their owners. At least one was simply hit with a shovel over the head. The dogs that kill the badgers regularly emerge with horrific injuries. Dogs traded Stephen Philpott from the USPCA said no gang would continue to feed a dog that is of no use. \"When those dogs get to the end of a season and are so severely damaged that they won't be able to badger bait the next season they are killed,\" he said.

He claimed that firms \"milked\" loyal customers through rising default gas and electricity tariffs. Energy UK said government intervention would be bad for customers. Five of the big six suppliers have announced price rises this year. Mr Clark said he did not have the power to affect prices directly, but the government could act to alter a \"deficiency\" in the market. Price rises Major energy firms announced increases in standard tariffs in the last few months, blaming investment requirements, government demands and the falling value of the pound. They include: The energy regulator Ofgem said that some of the price rises were hard to justify and Mr Clark has now told the Business Select Committee that the market is \"clearly not working\" for those on default tariffs. The government is due to respond to a two-year investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which found that two-thirds of UK households were paying \"over the odds\" for their energy compared with those who have switched to a different tariff. However, the CMA recommended that capping standard tariffs was not in the best interests of customers. That conclusion has been challenged widely, and there has been widespread speculation that the government could intervene with some sort of cap on these variable deals. Mr Clark told the committee that customers who could not shop around online, or who were not \"fleet of foot\", were being \"milked\" by the energy companies. He said the government's response would be decisive, and later said it would be \"muscular and strong\".

Banbury MP Victoria Prentis said pregnant women in the town will now spend one-and-a-half hours in a car while in labour to reach the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, and it was \"utterly unreasonable.\" Keith Strangwood from campaign group Keep the Horton General argued the decision was all about money, and added: \"The government bailed out the banks, why can't it bail out the NHS?\" Dr Joe McManners, clinical chair of OCCG, said there was a \"workforce crisis\" for recruiting obstetricians, and no \"viable long term option\" had come forward to run a doctor-led maternity unit in Banbury. The meeting was also told the changes had been endorsed by consultant obstetricians at the John Radcliffe Hospital. On Tuesday, the county's Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee decided to refer the decision to Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt, who now has the option of calling for an independent review.

The men sent messages mocking their victims, Leicester Crown Court heard. Leicestershire County Council said it was \"despicable fraud perpetrated across the country\". Three men were jailed while four men were given suspended sentences. Trading standards began investigating Faster Response Limited in March 2016 and it featured on Watchdog in 2017 before being shut down. But the company - led by Russell Canfield and Liam Cuffe - continued to trade with the same staff under the name Prestige Property Solutions. Both firms were based in Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire. Prosecutor Adam Pearson said the seven men would, after advertising OAP discounts, charge \"often infirm\" customers up to 10 times the correct amount for simple plumbing jobs. He said during the 15-month investigation, more than 150 complaints were made and their turnover would have \"exceeded \u00a31m\". A search warrant was executed on Prestige Property Solutions in August 2017. Mr Pearson said a 92-year-old woman was quoted \u00a33,000 for a \u00a3452 job and told her bath would have to be smashed in the process. In a WhatsApp exchange, plumber Leighton Costello sent a picture of a \u00a311.89 receipt for parts while the customer was eventually charged \u00a31,200. Mocking the customer, he wrote: \"That is what you get when you up sell lads.\" Who were the convicted men? The defendants exchanged messages while watching the Watchdog broadcast in July 2017 about Faster Response. One of them wrote: \"Says we've been ripping off pensions [sic] for years lol.\" Russell Canfield replied: \"I know that's wrong mate its everyone we ripped off not prejudice of age lol.\" Leicestershire County Council's head of regulatory service, Gary Connors, said the men \"all had their part to play in an emergency callout business which was set up from the outset to extract substantial sums of money, primarily from the elde\n\nSummary:","50":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Her parents said her bulimia was caused by taunts from her peers over her weight. The coroner, Michael Rose, called on magazines to stop the practice of showing pictures of \"wafer-thin\" models. He recorded a verdict of misadventure at the inquest in Taunton. 'Thin models' He said: \"The one class of person not here who I feel [is] directly responsible for what happened is the fashion industry. \"... The problems of eating disorders amongst young people, particularly girls, did not exist before the 1970s. From that period onwards the fashion industry and the magazines promoted thin models and the thin figure. \"I do ask, particularly the magazines in the fashion industry, to stop publishing photographs of wafer-thin girls. One magazine, I believe Vogue, has recently taken the decision not to do so. \"I do implore it, because at the end of the day for their benefit, families like this must suffer. It is, I am afraid, an increasing problem and until they control themselves it will continue.\" 'Cry for help' Miss Geraghty was found hanging by a rope from her bedroom by her father at their home in Nailsbourne on 14 July, 2011. Mr Rose said no-one could be sure she intended to take her own life and it could have been a cry for help. Earlier, the headteacher of Miss Geraghty's school said no bullying took place, following concerns from her parents. King's College headteacher Richard Biggs told the coroner there was \"rather a clash of personalities common in girls of that age\". Mr Biggs also told the hearing that he had questioned a group of girls at the school about allegations they had taunted the schoolgirl about her weight, but the girls had categorically denied doing so. Alison Chisholm, a manager at the Mental Health Trust in Somerset, said there had been a significant increase in the number of children suffering from eating disorders in the county, reflecting a nat\n\nSummary:","51":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

He said fire safety details were for specialist consultants and added that he had not designed the cladding used. The fire at the 24-storey tower in west London killed 72 people in June 2017. The inquiry - now in its second phase - is looking into how the building came to be covered in such cladding during its refurbishment between 2012 and 2016. Mr Sounes was in charge of the day-to-day management of the refurbishment project for the tower. On the second day of hearings, Mr Sounes was being examined about his knowledge of the building regulations and associated guidance. He was unable to explain to the inquiry how the new cladding system chosen for Grenfell met the government's guidance for fire safety in tall buildings, despite accepting that fire safety was \"fundamental to the work of an architect's practice\". Mr Sounes said he was familiar with the broad regulation that a building should not be able to spread fire on the outside. But he \"didn't recall hearing of\" the specific guidance that materials had to be of \"limited combustibility\" when used above 18m (59ft). Inquiry barrister Kate Grange asked him: \"You didn't apply your mind at the time of the Grenfell project to how this clause applied to the materials that you were selecting?\" He responded: \"As I wasn't myself preparing the documents - I did not, no.\" Later the inquiry was shown the specification for the project - which Mr Sounes had drawn up - and he was asked why he had not checked the products he had chosen complied with regulations. \"We asked for advice,\" he said, \"but it wasn't for us to... satisfy ourselves because I don't think that was within our ability.\" The inquiry had already heard that Studio E had no experience of working on tall buildings.

China sees the island as a breakaway province, which it has threatened to take back by force if necessary. Before her win Ms Tsai said she wanted to maintain the \"status quo\". But some analysts say her rhetoric has hardened somewhat in the wake of her victory, when she said that \"any forms of suppression will harm the stability of cross-strait relations\". Her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party beat the ruling Kuomintang, which has overseen friendlier and ever-closer ties with China on Saturday. Two days later, on Monday, Ms Tsai met former US Deputy Secretary of State William Burns, and vowed to maintain close relations with the US in all areas, particularly the economy. One report from the Reuters agency said that DPP Secretary General Joseph Wu would be going to the US. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also congratulated Ms Tsai on her victory, calling Taiwan \"an old friend\". She has already set up a taskforce to oversee the transfer of power, Taiwan's third transition of power in its democratic history. Chinese state media lashed out swiftly in the wake of the victory, saying that Taiwan should abandon its \"hallucination\" of independence.

She has lived there for 19 years despite several failed planning bids. As contractors arrived, Mrs Larkin complained of chest pains and was taken away by ambulance. She was taken to another address for a check-up while the council withdrew from the site. Earlier in the day, protesters had blocked access to the field ahead of the council contractors arriving to remove or demolish the caravan. But after she was taken ill, they left the site. Mrs Larkin does not have planning permission for the caravan and has been prosecuted twice for failing to comply with an enforcement notice which dates back to January 2001. She submitted another planning application earlier this week but planners said it was invalid. The authority said Mrs Larkin was made aware in October 2013 of the action it planned to take and any legal challenge should have been brought within three months of that date. Its chief planning officer, Andrew Farrow, said: \"There have been repeated attempts over many years to bring this matter to a conclusion in a reasonable and sensitive way, but regrettably the council's efforts have been constantly rebuffed by Mrs Larkin.\" Commenting on Mrs Larkins' ill-health, he added that \"it was appropriate\" for council officials to withdraw from the site Wednesday.

Demonstrators say government plans for a census are a ploy to delay elections. Mr Kabila is constitutionally barred from running for a third term. The government admits next year's elections could be delayed, but says the census is vital to ensure free and fair elections. 'Looters killed' The BBC's Maud Jullien reports from Kinshasa that most shops are closed and internet and text messaging services have been blocked, apparently on the orders of the government. Hundreds of angry young men burned tyres in several neighbourhoods, looted mainly Asian-owned shops and threw stones at cars, our reporter says. A town hall in southern Kinshasa, a city with a population of more than nine million, was also set ablaze, AFP news agency reports. In the poor area of Masina on the city's outskirts, police tried to disperse protesters by shooting into the air, our correspondent says. Ten people were arrested on Tuesday, AFP reports. Government spokesman Lambert Mende said two policemen and two \"looters\" had been killed in Monday's clashes in the capital. Human rights activists said up to 10 people may have been killed. Opposition figures suggested the number of those who had died may be higher still. Boycott The demonstrators called on Mr Kabila to step down when his term expires and carried placards which said: \"Don't touch the constitution\". Hundreds of people also protested on Monday in Goma, the main trading post in the east. The protests coincided with a debate in the Senate, the upper parliamentary chamber, over government plans to hold a census before elections.

It will \"raise the bar for vulnerable children across the country\", said the Department for Education (DfE). It will look at every area of the care system, from a child's first referral to social services to outcomes for children leaving care at 18. In March 2020, 80,080 children were being looked after in the care system in England, up from 64,400 in March 2010, according to DfE figures. Announcing the review, the department said: \"It will address major challenges such as the increase in numbers of looked after children, the inconsistencies in children's social care practice, outcomes across the country, and the failure of the system to provide enough stable homes for children.\" It will also look at the \"capacity and capability of the system to support and strengthen families in order to prevent children being taken into care unnecessarily\". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the review would \"not shy away from exposing problems\" and committed it to prioritising the views of those with direct experience of the care system. Speaking about his appointment, Mr MacAlister told BBC News he had been \"really encouraged\" by the response to the news from across the political spectrum and care industry bodies. 'Radical' intentions Reviews were often prompted by \"a particular case of a breach where a child has died\", he said, adding this \"has often been the prism through which we've looked at changes in children's social care before\". Mr MacAlister praised the \"very broad terms of reference\" the government has set for the review. \"They've not tried to constrain it unnecessarily,\" he said, adding he wanted to make sure his eventual report \"can be implemented, but is radical\".

She said that in an ideal world there would not be 43 separate police forces across England and Wales. But she also said that mergers were unlikely to happen in the future. The comments were in answer to a question from Det Supt Andy Street from Bedfordshire Police, who asked: \"When will the Acpo (Association of Chief Police Officers) ranks take their share of reduction in numbers being experienced by superintendents and all other ranks?\" Ms Owens said that restructuring the police force would lead to a reduction in chief constables, deputy chief constables, and assistant chief constables. She said she believed this was the best way to meet the financial challenges while protecting frontline services. 'Collaborative arrangements' \"We don't currently have that so we're having to come to collaborative arrangements - I speak on behalf of my own force,\" she said. \"We currently share an assistant chief constable position with Sussex and that does actually come with its own challenges, regardless of the skill of the individual.\" She said she thought there would not be mergers and that it was more likely that under the new police crime commissioners, who are due to be elected in November, there would be more collaboration with neighbouring forces. In August 2011 a joint major crime investigation team, made up of officers from the Surrey and Sussex forces, was created.

The city is one of China's biggest and is a major industrial centre. It is situated in the southern province of Guangdong, across the mainland border from Hong Kong. The landslide has blanketed a vast area of 380,000 sq m (455,000 sq yards) covering it with up to 10m (32ft) of mud at an industrial park, Shenzhen's emergency management office said on its official microblog. State news agency Xinhua said that the landslide caused an explosion at a natural gas pipeline. Workers have cleaned up about 400m of damaged pipeline and are now repairing it. China's history of industrial accidents China's land and resources ministry said in a statement on its website that initial investigations showed the landslide happened when a huge mound of soil, cement chunks and other construction waste became unstable. \"Because the mound was very large, and the angle of its slope was overly steep, this led to it losing stability and collapsing,\" it said. People's Daily said the mound had accumulated at a stone quarry that had been converted into a dumping area with its entrance and exit facing an industrial district. Residents evacuated from the surrounding area described hearing loud roars when the landslide happened.

The tenth anniversary iPhone, which retails for \u00a3999, is Apple's most expensive handset yet. Analysts said Apple was now closer to becoming the first trillion dollar company, as shares rose 2%. The California-based firm, which also sells computers, iPads and makes revenue from apps, is now valued at nearly $900bn (\u00a3690bn). With iPhone 8 and X handsets now on sale, Mr Cook predicted Apple's \"biggest quarter ever\" in the three months to the end of the year. Shoppers queued up at Apple stores in dozens of countries, as the high-end iPhone X launched on Friday. The iPhone X abandons the signature \"home\" button and can be unlocked with face-scanning technology, among other new features. \"A trillion-dollar market cap may now be in Cook's sights in light of these results and guidance around iPhone X,\" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at GBH Insights. Mr Cook said the company was \"firing on all cylinders\", thanks to a sales rebound in China, record purchases through the App Store and robust demand for its latest iPhone models. It sold more than 46.6 million phones in the July to September period, up 3% year-on-year. That produced $28.8bn, or more than half of its revenue. Other products, including the Mac, iPad and Apple Watch, also did well, growing in the double digits. The firm got another boost from its services division, which includes the App store, Apple Pay and its music subscriptions service. That unit made $8.5bn in the quarter, up 34% year-on-year, thanks in part to a one-time adjustment. Though its costs increased, Apple said profits were $10.7bn in the quarter, increasing 18%.

Four of the Greenpeace activists had tried to board a Gazprom oil rig on Wednesday, to protest against drilling. Russia accused Greenpeace of violating an exclusion zone around the rig, but the group said its ship was in international waters. Greenpeace published photos that it said showed Russian security personnel in balaclavas confronting the activists with guns and knives after abseiling from helicopters onto the Dutch-flagged Arctic Sunrise. Greenpeace says planned drilling at Gazprom's Prirazlomnaya rig in the Barents Sea threatens a unique and fragile environment - a claim denied by Moscow.

Greenpeace dismissed claims that a safety pod on the ship in any way resembled a bomb. The group of activists being held includes six Britons. A spokeswoman for the Murmansk region's border guards told local media that the Arctic Sunrise's captain had already been questioned, and the activists were being taken to court for \"further legal procedures\". The Russian foreign ministry earlier accused the group of \"aggressive and provocative\" behaviour. Moscow also said that its coastguard vessel had to fire warning shots across Arctic Sunrise. The Gazprom project is Russia's first effort to extract oil from the Barents Sea. Prirazlomnaya is scheduled to begin production by the end of the year. Russia's economy and its recent growth depend to a large extent on income from its huge oil and gas deposits.\n\nSummary:","68":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Antoinette Sandbach believes a lack of free parking in the town means businesses could suffer. Flintshire council said it had a good \"working relationship with Mold Town Council in addressing parking issues\". Before the five council wardens were introduced, parking offences were enforced by police. Conservative AM Ms Sandbach claims figures, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, show more than \u00a322,000 has been raised so far, with 351 penalty notices still unpaid. Of the 995 tickets issued, 613 were in Mold, followed by 145 in Flint, 83 in Buckley, 66 for Shotton and 32 in Holywell. Of the fines, 800 were for illegal parking on the street. Ms Sandbach said: \"It is interesting that Mold is one of the few places in Flintshire that charges for parking. \"Small traders - who are competing against large shopping centres with free parking - consistently tell me that parking is an issue for their customers. \"I quite appreciate that certain locations and especially disabled parking bays, need to be kept clear to ensure traffic can flow easily, but if people are parking illegally to avoid car park charges, that can not be good for shops and businesses in our town centres.\" She added: \"I'd ask Flintshire councillors to look again at their parking policies for Mold. \"Anything that deters trade is a serious issue in today's economic climate.\" Flintshire's five civil parking enforcement officers issued the notices between 1 October and the first week in December. Councillor Bernie Attridge, cabinet member for environment, said there had been \"a noticeable improvement in general levels of traffic congestion and highway obstructions\" since the wardens were introduced.

But in fact only some villagers are packing up and leaving. For others, it's a waiting game and some suspect a house-sale simply will not be possible. The reason for the empty houses is simple. HS2 is reportedly coming to this quiet neck of the Warwickshire woods. \"The first we heard about it was when a journalist knocked on our neighbour's door,\" says Martin Beckett, who has lived in the village with his wife Jane for 11 years. Like many other residents, they came to Burton Green to retire - for a taste of the quiet life. Sadly, it has not worked out that way. Villagers have spent four years fighting the plans for HS2. Work on Phase One of the project, from London to Birmingham, is due to start in 2017. \"When we first heard about the scheme, we thought we were going to be the sacrificial lambs for a project that would benefit the country,\" Mr Beckett says. \"But the more you hear about the scheme, the more you realise it's fundamentally flawed. I can't see that the line is ever going to break even. \"People all over the country, who live nowhere near this thing, are going to be paying for it through their taxes.\" Last year, Mr Beckett served a blight notice on the government - a kind of reverse compulsory purchase order which, if accepted by the government, means they will buy a resident's home at its \"unblighted\" value. On 21 December, he heard had been successful. \"We thought we could finally see light at the end of the tunnel, pardon the pun,\" he says. Sadly, since then, the bureaucratic cogs have run slower. The couple have found a house they would like to move to but they are still waiting for a valuation of their own home by HS2. \"We have found a place to move to that we would not like to lose,\" he says. \"It's not that we are desperate to leave the village.

BiFab said it was going through a \"natural down-manning process\" as it approached the end of work on the Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm project. It has warned this could also mean redundancies among permanent staff. BiFab has informed workers about potential planned redundancies, but said that no decisions had been taken. The Scottish government said it has been \"fully focused and working intensively\" to secure the company's long-term future. 'Absolutely pivotal' The firm said it had notified the government, public agencies and its workforce because the potential number of redundancies was a figure of more than 20. The company's work manufacturing components for the Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm at Arnish, near Stornoway, is due to come to an end within weeks. Most of those at Arnish are agency workers. BiFab employs 30 people at the yard, which is owned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The engineering firm also operates yards at Methil and Burntisland in Fife. Unite has urged government action to help BiFab. The union's regional officer Bob McGregor said: \"The Scottish government's intervention last year to create a lifeline for these yards was absolutely pivotal. \"We need the same scale of intervention now led by the government to save these jobs. \"These yards are absolutely central to the creation of a viable renewables industry in Scotland.

The H5N8 bird flu strain has been found in poultry and wild birds in 14 countries including Germany and France. The government's chief vet Prof Nigel Gibbens said the risk to humans was low and no UK cases had been found. The precautionary measures announced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) apply to farmers and anyone in England who keeps any birds, even those with a few chickens in their back garden. Similar restrictions have been introduced in Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland. Farmers are being asked to look for signs of infection and to take robust disinfectant measures. Members of the public are also being told to report cases of dead wild waterfowl - such as swans, geese and ducks - or gulls, or five or more dead birds of other species to Defra. Defra said it had increased its surveillance, and keepers are being urged to make sure feed and water is not accessible to wild birds. 'Happy birds' Daniel Brown, a chicken farmer from Cambridge with 40,000 hens in three sheds, said Defra had made the correct decision. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We'll be shutting them in this morning. We'll be putting in extra toys for the birds - straw bales, empty bottles, cardboard boxes - anything to give them something else to think about. \"They love going outside, and now they can't for their own safety so we'll be doing anything we can just to keep the birds happy.\" Prof Gibbens said: \"We are closely monitoring the situation across Europe and have scaled up surveillance in response to the heightened risk. \"As a precaution, and to allow time for poultry and captive bird keepers to put in place appropriate biosecurity measures, we have declared a 30-day prevention zone to reduce the risk of infection from wild birds.\" Prof Gibbens said the disease can get into housed birds and urged farmers to increase and maint\n\nSummary:","72":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Shortly after she departed, Mr Banks, an insurance tycoon who founded Leave.EU, shared a tweet from Ms Lucas that wished Ms Thunberg \"bon voyage\".

But no reopening dates for the sector have yet been announced in the Republic of Ireland. Mr Swann was speaking in the assembly on Monday. The minister, responding to a question from Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) colleague Alan Chambers, said the health regulations in the Republic of Ireland were clear. Those resident in the Republic can travel within their county or up to 20km (12.4 miles) from home. \"There's also an onus, not just on the guards (Irish police) and PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland), but also those within the hospitality industry not to be actively promoting or seeking cross-border business trade at this minute in time while there is such a disparity in vaccination rates on either side of the border,\" Mr Swann said. The Republic of Ireland, which is about a month behind Northern Ireland in its vaccination programme, has been in what has been described as the \"longest lockdown in the world\" and there is pressure to reopen society, particularly from the hospitality sector.

It's a starting pistol for the next phase of living room domination, as the first set of next-generation games consoles for seven years takes centre stage. To understand how this multi-billion pound industry got to this point, it's useful to return to where we were just 18 years ago. It was 1995, and gaming journalists - there weren't as many back then - were filing their way around the Los Angeles Convention Centre for the first-ever E3. The news on everyone's lips that week was about the cocky newcomer: Sony. Its PlayStation console was looking to muscle in on the already established, and well-loved, brands of Sega and Nintendo. They were fighting for the biggest slice of a $4bn prize. Sega had its Saturn, and Nintendo - stylishly absent from the show - would in the coming months launch the N64, while already consigned to oblivion was Atari's Jaguar. Merry-go-round As it turned out it was the PlayStation that took the industry to another level, forcing the transition from geeky to mainstream, bringing the sales of top games in line with blockbuster films for the first time. At E3 2013, the battle is now for an industry that is worth an estimated $18.3bn (\u00a311.8bn). But that number doesn't tell the whole story, down as it is from the all-time high of $28.9bn in 2008. \"In 2012 the World market for boxed console and PC games dropped a significant 18%,\" says Piers Harding-Rolls, a director and gaming expert from analysts IHS. \"This year the market has been quiet, partly due to the console transition and lack of new releases. \"There have been a few stand out titles that have sold well - Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider as examples, but numerous second-tier titles have underperformed. We forecast the world boxed game market sales to decline this year by 10% to $20.2bn, including boxed PC games.\" In this ye\n\nSummary:","75":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The act allows relatives to rent graves for 25-99 year periods if they can't afford the leasehold fees on their loved one's permanent grave. The state library of New South Wales says that burials are an expensive business, and that a single grave can cost anywhere between A$2,970 and A$4,800 (\u00a32,727; $3,506). Political issue The existing law means the headstones of deceased relatives can be removed if relatives don't renew the deceased's plot of land within two years of expiration. Their remains are dug up, and go into a communal ossuary or \"bone room\", with the original land then being re-let. You might also be interested in: Paul Toole, NSW's Minister for Lands and Forestry, told the Sydney Morning Herald that while the government recognised that burials were a \"sensitive issue\", renewable graves helped cemeteries stay sustainable. NSW Jewish Board of Deputies' Vic Alhadeff pointed out in an interview with news.com.au that as the act makes exceptions for religious or cultural groups requiring graves not to be reused, \"this means the Jewish community's religious needs in the burial space are not at risk from the newly introduced right to re-use graves\". But the law has been heavily criticised by Australia's opposition party, with Labor politician Mick Veitch saying renewable graves were \"macabre\" and \"impose horrible choices on many families\". He says: \"This regulation will lead to two classes of burials: permanent monuments for those who can afford it and those who can't afford it will be forced to see their loved one dug up.\" An inquiry into the law by the Upper House Regulation Committee will take public evidence until 7 September, and the review is set to be announced the following month.

The growth was widely expected after the German economy rose 0.7% between April and June. However, the overall figure masks the mixed economic fortunes among the countries that make up the 17-country eurozone area. Germany and France both posted stronger-than-expected growth, expanding 0.7% and 0.5% respectively. Portugal, among the smallest and the weakest eurozone economies, showed the fastest growth, at 1.1%. The country was one of three that had to take a multi-billion-euro bailout. Obstacles But Spain, which had to seek outside support for its struggling banking sector, saw its economic output fall by 0.1% on the quarter. Italy and the Netherlands both saw output drop by 0.2%. European Commission Vice-President Olli Rehn said the figures suggested the European economy was gradually gaining momentum, but added there was no room for complacency. \"There are still substantial obstacles to overcome: the growth figures remain low and the tentative signs of growth are still fragile,\" he said. \"A number of member states still have unacceptably high unemployment rates; the implementation of essential, but difficult reforms across the EU is still in its early stages. So there is still a very long way to go.\" Analysts from Capital Economics said: \"The return to modest rates of economic growth in the eurozone as a whole won't address the deep-seated economic and fiscal problems of the peripheral countries.\" Locomotive The figures reaffirm Germany's position as the powerhouse behind the eurozone. The country narrowly avoided recession earlier this year, but GDP in the second quarter of 2013 was driven up by demand from both consumers and businesses. The improvement comes just weeks before a federal election that will see Chancellor Angela Merkel stand for a third term in office.

Three small base stations have been put on the roofs of the pub, the school and the doctors' surgery. It is the result of months of campaigning by Graham Powell, a local county councillor. \"In terms of mobile phone coverage, it's a case of the haves and the have-nots,\" said Mr Powell. \"And the divide between the two is increasingly growing. \"We have to bridge that gap and anything we can do is worthwhile.\" Mr Powell said he entered local politics because he wanted to improve the phone and broadband coverage in the rural area. A former telecommunications worker, he took on the job of getting the people of Ewyas Harold behind the idea, which led to the village becoming one of 12 picked from hundreds to take part in the trial run by Vodafone. He cites emergencies as an important reason for having network coverage, adding: \"I'd hate for someone to have an accident and not be able to call for help.\" However, possibly the greatest impact will be on the village's children. Teenagers and mobile phones usually go hand in hand - but until now, not in Ewyas Harold. Louis Eastwood and Rachel Mailes, both 15, and 16-year-old Tash Bagley, own mobile phones but can only use them when they leave the village and pick up a signal. \"For me, getting the proper signal when it's all switched on, is 10 out of 10 in importance,\" said Tash. \"If I can't contact my friends I feel like they can make plans without me.\" \"I'd be so happy if the signal works and make up for lost time and just text loads and loads,\" said Louis. \"We're OK really, because we get a signal in school.

If the deal materialises, it would be far larger than the listing of Google, which raised a paltry $1.9bn in comparison. The daring move is raising eyebrows and sparking talk that China's dot.com boom could be turning into an unsustainable bubble. It also comes as investors have grown wary of Chinese firms listed in the US following a number of accounting scandals. The company is reported to be meeting with banks in Beijing this week to pick which financial institution will handle the bumper deal.

Founded in 2004, the company is reported to have more than 25 million users and more than 50 million daily page views, and generates 300,000 orders per day. It has already raised a whopping $1.5bn from a group of high-profile strategic investors including Digital Sky Technologies, which invested in Facebook and discount buying website Groupon in the US. Members of the Walton family, who founded Wal-Mart, and Robin Li, the boss of Chinese internet darling Baidu, also ploughed money into the company.

That means the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.6%, in line with forecasts. Average weekly earnings in the three months to February, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.8% compared with the same period a year earlier. Growth was slightly lower than the rate in January. When bonuses are included, weekly earnings rose by 1.7%. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in March fell by 20,700 to 772,400, the ONS said. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, said: \"The story of the UK labour market has long been a 'jobs-rich' but 'pay-poor' one. The latest numbers are no exception with good news for those looking for work, but less so for those already in employment.\" Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said the UK's \"employment miracle shows no signs of drawing to a close\" and expected the jobless rate to continue falling further in the coming months. Analysis: Robert Peston: BBC economics editor This combination of jobs growth and pay rises is just what David Cameron and George Osborne hoped and prayed would happen when they set the UK on a path of austerity, both massively shrinking public sector employment - from more than 21% of all UK jobs in 2010 to 17.4% today - and freezing public-sector pay. They assumed they would receive an electoral reward for being tough on the deficit - the record 10% gap between public spending and tax revenues - so long as real pay rose a good few months before polling day and unemployment fell.

There were also complaints that motorists were driving on roads before they were reopened. \"We're urging people to plan ahead to enjoy the Olympic time trial on Wednesday. This will help us minimise the inevitable disruption that staging events of this size causes,\" said Ms Clack. During the time trial, riders will race against the clock, starting at Hampton Court Palace before heading south over Hampton Court Bridge and into Elmbridge. The route takes in several towns and villages including Thames Ditton, Weston Green, Esher, Hersham and Cobham as well as Kingston and Richmond. The men's route also goes through Teddington and East and West Molesey. SCC said extensive road closures and parking restrictions would be in place around the time trial routes from the early hours of the morning and that people should check SCC's Go Surrey website for details.\n\nSummary:","86":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Jo's body was found in the basement of the building where he lived in Seoul. The 52-year-old was due to be questioned by police next week. He mainly had roles in TV shows, but also appeared in a number of films. The actor initially denied wrongdoing, but released a statement on 27 February apologising to his accusers. \"Everything is my fault, and I am the one to blame,\" he said. \"I am deeply sorry to all the victims for the pain I've caused, and from here on out, I will not avoid the social and legal consequences of my mistakes.\" Who was Jo Min-ki? He was a veteran of stage and screen, having made his theatre debut in 1982. He won a string of awards for TV performances in the 1990s and 2000s, and appeared on a reality programme about famous fathers and their teenage daughters. He joined Cheongju University's drama department in 2010 but was fired in February when allegations of raping and harassing students came to light. After his victims spoke out, he was edited out of the TV drama Children of the Small God and replaced by Lee Jae Yong, and had his contract terminated by his agency. South Korea's growing #MeToo scandal Jo is one of the a string of high-profile figures to have been accused of sexual misconduct in South Korea in recent weeks. Allegations began to emerge in January, after a female prosecutor publicly spoke out about being groped by a senior male colleague.

He's not the only star who's had a tattoo on their face recently - model and actress Amber Rose has prompted a lot of chat online after going public with her latest tattoos. An Instagram post revealed she's apparently had the names of her two sons, Bash and Slash, inked on her forehead. In another post she added, \"beauty is not what's on the outside. It's what's on the inside that counts.\" Both stars are proud of their new tattoos, but other people who've been inked in visible places have had mixed feelings after getting theirs done. Radio 1 Newsbeat's spoken to other people with visible tattoos about what inspired them and whether they've come to regret them. 'If I could go back and make the decision again, I wouldn't do it.' Kevin Paul is a tattoo artist and says he regrets getting his face inked when he was younger. He tells Newsbeat that it has an impact on how people perceive him. \"When I had my cheeks done, I noticed the world was judging me in a completely different way.

A government-funded trial for an inhaled vaccine is not expected to be completed until August. Families say it means loved ones remain at high-risk of dying from Covid. People with learning disabilities are up to six times more likely to die from Covid-19, a report from Public Health England (PHE) shows. Everyone on the GP learning disability register will be invited for vaccination as part of priority group six, PHE confirmed. But some parents say the jab remains an unviable option for their children. Sue Keegan, from Chudleigh Knighton in Devon, is a single carer for her 30-year-old son Sam. He has Down's Syndrome and autism, and an extreme phobia of hospitals, doctors, and needles. While Sam was able to receive his vaccines as a baby, his sensory needs have stopped him from doing so as an adult. \"He can't cope with people touching him,\" said Ms Keegan. \"He's a very strong young man, and he will attack. He would just flip completely.\" Ms Keegan said it meant the Covid vaccine, in its current format, was \"totally\" out of the question for her son. \"The only way I can protect him is if we don't go anywhere,\" she said. Twenty-two-year-old Ben, who has Down's syndrome and autism, has been shielding with his mother, Clare in Torbay, Devon since March 2020. \"In the last year, I've probably left the house no more than 10 times,\" Clare said. While the vaccine represented a glimmer of hope for many people, it was less straightforward for Ben. \"He's very anxious as part of his condition,\" Clare said. \"He doesn't totally understand what injections are - for him it would be someone coming towards him with something that looks as though it will hurt.

The report, written by management consultants Verita, said the timing of the events had led to the belief there was a connection between the two. However, it said: \"We examined closely the sequence of events that led to the suspension [and] concluded that the suspension was made in the interests of patient safety rather than for any other reason.\" 'Political' row The suspension was also prompted by concerns raised by families and doctors at Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust. A separate report examined concerns about 14 Leeds cases, which were raised by doctors and managers in Newcastle. It found there had been unnecessary delay in two cases, unsatisfactory risk assessments in another two cases, and failures in communication in five. However, the report concluded the balance of evidence did not support some of the situations described by Newcastle and the families.

The Church said the final sum for each was above the asking price. A number of other kirks are under offer, including Quarff kirk and Sand kirk, as part of the Church's plan for closures. The kirks to be closed were announced in October 2018. From an initial 20 to be closed, this has been reduced to 19. The Church said the closures were necessary due to national and local financial pressures. The aim of closing the buildings was to ensure \"a more sustainable future\" for the decreasing congregations in the isles. Money raised from the sales will ensure the upkeep of those kirks that will remain open, it said. \"The money that we get from these churches is going to be put back into Shetland,\" confirmed Rev Lynn Brady, interim Minister in Shetland. That cash will improve buildings that the Church is keeping and help make them \"up to date\" and a \"centre for the community.\" \"We're hoping that all the buildings we have will get wi-fi so that we can stream services,\" she added. Earlier this year, Shetland was part of a redesign for the Church of Scotland in the region.

He estimates there will be 4,200 humanist weddings this year, more than Church of Scotland ceremonies. The Kirk said it was not convinced the figures were correct. It said weddings in the Christian faith, including Roman Catholic and other denominations, were still well ahead of humanist weddings. About half of all weddings in Scotland are civil ceremonies carried out by an official registrar. The others are classed as religious or belief ceremonies. Religious marriages in Scotland were never restricted by location, unlike civil ceremonies which were always in a register office before a 2002 change allowed other \"approved places\". In 2005 the Registrar General for Scotland decided, after considering the European Convention on Human Rights, to allow humanists to conduct weddings as \"authorised celebrants\" - giving them equal status with ministers of religion. Karen Watts and Martin Reijns were the first couple in Scotland to be married by a humanist celebrant, when they tied the knot at Edinburgh Zoo on 18 June 2005. Ms Watts said the pair would not have been comfortable with a religious ceremony and a civil registration seemed a \"bit cold\". She said at the time: \"Neither of us are religious and it would have felt hypocritical to get married in a church. \"But at the same time we wanted something more meaningful than the legal civil ceremony.\" Mr MacRae, chief executive of the Humanist Society Scotland (HSS), said its ceremonies allowed people to celebrate in a way that suited them, free from religious dogma. He said humanism was a \"rational, ethical and democratic approach to life\" and that was put \"front-and-centre\" in its approach to marriage. Mr MacRae said the change in the rules on belief weddings were a \"great Scottish success story\". \"It is shocking discrimina\n\nSummary:","93":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The multi-billion euro programme is over budget and much delayed, but the first spacecraft to prove the system should finally launch next year. A further 14 operational satellites are expected to fly from late 2012. SpaceOpal is a joint undertaking between the German firm Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Raumfahrtanwendungen (GfR) and the Italian company Telespazio. GfR was set up by the German space agency (DLR) to offer Galileo services. SpaceOpal signed the contract with the European Space Agency, which is acting as technical and procurement agent on the sat-nav project for the European Commission. The company's involvement will involve the day-to-day running of Galileo. It will do this from two Galileo Control Centres in Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich, and Fucino, near Rome. \"The contract demonstrates the strong commitment and the clear political will to create an independent global satellite-navigation system in Europe,\" said DLR chairman, Professor Jan Woerner. Contracts to provide the operational satellites themselves, the rockets to launch them, and additional technical and management support were signed in January. The two work packages still outstanding cover activities that will monitor the status of the satellite constellation and look after the timing and navigation data which lie at the heart of Galileo. Galileo should have been operational by now but the project has run into myriad technical, commercial and political obstacles, including early objections from the US, who thought a rival system to GPS might be used to attack its armed forces. The venture came very close to being abandoned in 2007 when the public-private partnership put in place to build and run the project collapsed.

Participants from more than 140 countries are expected to attend. Almost 900 experts identified protracted global disputes as the \"major threats affecting mankind\". Conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East were singled out as being of particular concern. Environmental threats, including water shortages and the spread of infectious diseases, have also been highlighted in the WEF's annual Global Risks report. In its presentation to the press, the WEF stressed that more than \"25 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" interstate conflicts, and \"relics of the Cold War\" were now the most likely risks to global stability. Espen Barth Eide, a former Norwegian defence minister who worked on the report, said the conflicts that posed the biggest risks were not constrained to \"direct shooting\". Mr Eide said \"major power plays\", such as the situation between Russia and Ukraine, were of concern, as were strained relations between Asia's two biggest economies - Japan and China. He referred to 2014 as the \"annus horribilis\" of global politics, and warned that for the first time in many years, politics was encroaching on economics and global trade. Sanctions, such as those imposed on Iran and Russia by Western states, were impinging on business, he added, as was a resurgence of protectionism. Other risks identified in the report include extreme weather events, the failure of national governance, and rising unemployment. The threat of cyber attacks, as highlighted by the recent hack of Sony Pictures, and the \"increased vulnerability of classified information\" were also given prominence by the WEF trend-setters. \"Our appeal [to policy makers] is to invest more into co-operation and diplomacy,\" Mr Eide told reporters.\n\nSummary:","99":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The Mayor, Dorothy Williams, said the council was prepared to pay up to \u00a315,400 for a 12-month contract to continue CCTV coverage in the town.

Investors cheered the trading statement and Next shares jumped 10% by the close of the London markets. Among the Christmas trading updates released so far, Next, John Lewis and House of Fraser have all reported healthy sales. Debenhams has been the major disappointment.

And most of the Covid-19 vaccines under development, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), will need to be refrigerated at temperatures well below 0C, the freezing point of water. Imagine a Covid-19 vaccine that is heat tolerant and can be transported to remote towns and villages for tens of millions of jabs without depending on the cold chain. A group of Indian scientists are working on such a vaccine. The \"warm\" or a heat-stable vaccine, they claim, can be stored at 100C for 90 minutes, at 70C for about 16 hours, and at 37C for more than a month and more. Raghavan Varadarajan, a biophysicist and professor at the Indian Institute of Science, and his team have tested this vaccine on animals. \"We got good results,\" Prof Varadarajan told me. Now they are waiting for funding to begin safety and toxicity tests on humans. Their paper has been accepted for publication in Journal of Biological Chemistry, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, published by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. \"I am hopeful that after this study, newer avenues would open up with regards to having cold-chain independent vaccines,\" said Dr Renu Swarup, secretary of India's Department of Biotechnology. Vaccines that can withstand high temperatures are rare. Only three - offering protection against meningitis, human papillomavirus (HPV) and cholera - are licensed and approved by WHO for use at temperatures up to 40C.

Ms Khalip is the wife of opposition leader Andrei Sannikov, sentenced on Saturday to five years in prison for organising the election protests. She walked free from court almost five months after being detained along with hundreds of other activists. The trial in the capital Minsk comes after the election in which President Alexander Lukashenko was re-elected with nearly 80% of the vote. Western monitors described the poll as \"flawed\". Harsh reprisals Mr Sannikov won the most votes among the nine opposition candidates, taking 2.43%. Police violently dispersed a rally that drew tens of thousands of protesters complaining about electoral fraud on election night on 19 December. Around 700 people were arrested, including seven presidential candidates. Since then, more than 20 opposition activists have been sent to prison. The Russian Foreign Ministry has criticised the \"harsh\" sentences, calling on the authorities in Minsk to stick more closely \"to their international commitments in the area of human rights and freedoms\". Mr Sannikov's sentencing on Saturday has also provoked protests from European Union and American officials. Mr Sannikov, a former deputy foreign minister, said during his trial that he was tortured by the secret police, and that its chief threatened harsh reprisals against his wife and their four-year-old son. Earlier this year, the authorities threatened to put their son in an orphanage. Ms Khalip, 43, will be on probation. She will have to face the court again in two years' time. After the hearing she told reporters her trial was political. \"I still feel like a political hostage,\" she said.

They were both members of Muca, which fights for land it says has been fraudulently taken from farmers and given to multinationals. Muca says dozens of farmers and activists have died in land rights clashes since 2009. The most high-profile recent killing was of award-winning indigenous rights activist Berta Caceres, who was shot at her home in the western town of La Esperanza in March. Mr Flores was the president of Muca (The United Farmworkers Movement of Aguan). He and Mr George, who had both previously been threatened, were killed by hooded men armed with rifles in Tocoa, 240km (149 miles) north of the capital, Tegucigalpa. Muca opposes large agriculture companies that grow African oil palm, saying land has fraudulently been transferred to them from farmers. It pursues legal cases on farmers' behalf but also carries out illegal land occupations in the Bajo Aguan valley. Amnesty International's Americas director, Erika Guevara-Rosas, said Honduras had become a \"'no-go zone' for anyone daring to campaign for the protection of the environment\". US Ambassador to Honduras James Nealon condemned the killings, saying: \"The United States of America calls for a prompt and thorough investigation and for the full force of the law to be brought to bear against those found responsible.\" Government spokesman Luis Osabas said the killings were being investigated.\n\nSummary:","106":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Identification documents found with the bodies near the town of San Fernando on Tuesday matched those of the two men. The massacre of the migrants has been blamed on a powerful drug cartel. One of two confirmed survivors has said members of the Los Zetas cartel opened fire when they refused to carry out assassinations for them. The 58 men and 14 women were from South and Central America and had been trying to reach the United States. Killers identified Mr Suarez Vazquez was one of the first people to find the migrants' bullet-ridden bodies at an abandoned ranch near San Fernando on 24 August. Both he and Mr Suarez Sanchez, the head of the local Public Security department, were investigating the killings, but disappeared the following day. Officials feared that they had been abducted. Then a fortnight later, two bodies were found in a field about 50km (30 miles) north-east of San Fernando. The Tamaulipas state attorney-general's office said identification documents found on the bodies matched those of the missing officials, but that it was conducting DNA tests to confirm the identities. After their disappearance was reported, Mr Suarez Vazquez's wife told the BBC that she feared the worst and that she assumed those who had abducted them were connected to organised crime in the region. If confirmed, the killings would be a new demonstration of the power and ruthlessness of Mexico's drug cartels. On Monday, officials said an anonymous caller had told them where to find the bodies of three men who had participated in the massacre. A Honduran man who survived the slaughter later identified the three dead men as having been among the killers, the officials added. A total of seven men have now been identified as suspects.

The big cat was first spotted early on Thursday morning on CCTV, and made several other appearances after that. Nightshift workers evacuated the building and part of the sprawling factory complex was closed. The car plant is the largest in India, producing almost a million vehicles a year. When thousands of morning workers arrived, they were forced to stand outside and wait while 12 forest department workers and about 50 policemen were deployed in the search. The animal was spotted on CCTV in the engine department, which covers six acres. A local journalist at the scene told the BBC that rescuers had brought in two live goats and raw meat to lure the leopard out of hiding. Some people also tried throwing firecrackers in a bid to dislodge the big cat, wildlife conservator Vinod Kumar told the Press Trust of India. But after the leopard was tracked down and tranquilised its safety was assured, the authorities assured the BBC. \"The leopard has been taken to hospital for medical examination and will be released later into the wild,\" R Anand, Deputy Conservator of Forests in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon, told the BBC on Friday afternoon. Instances of human-animal conflict have been increasing in India, where shrinking animal habitats often drive elephants, tigers and leopards into residential areas. There are around 12,000-14,000 leopards in the country, and one is killed every day on average. Last year, a leopard entered a school in the Indian city of Bangalore and injured six people who were trying to capture it. It took 10 hours to catch and tranquillise the animal.

In November 2010 five Rotherham men were jailed for sexual offences against under-age girls. Now Barnardo's says the council is working with vulnerable people and targeting \"hot spot\" areas. In June MPs described Rotherham Council as \"inexcusably slow\", while South Yorkshire Police was said to have \"let down\" victims of grooming. The Barnardo's review has praised links between the council's youth service and South Yorkshire's Protecting Young People Police Officers (PYPPOs), for their combined work \"in identifying and reducing the numbers of vulnerable people in the community, in schools and identified 'hot spot' areas\".

It should, the report adds, also including hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation; housing and social landlords; taxis and public transport; takeaways and food outlets, shopping centres and public spaces, pubs and clubs.

He had his eyes gouged by a female passenger, before being punched in the face. Three of the car occupants were later jailed for the attack. AMs gave their support on Tuesday to a new law for 999 staff. Labour MP Chris Bryant wants to double the maximum sentence for common assault on an emergency worker to a year. The Rhondda MP said there were 20 such assaults in Wales a day. AMs unanimously agreed on Tuesday that the Parliamentary legislation, which has been given support by the UK and Welsh governments, can apply to assaults on workers in the Welsh NHS and fire services. Det Sgt Dowler said any additional protection for 999 staff had to be welcomed, as he described the attack on him. He had stopped late at night after spotting a parked car with smoke coming from the wheels. But as he approached the vehicle, the driver ran off, and the officer chase him - ending up on the floor with the man. \"Whilst I was holding onto the driver on the floor one of the female occupants of the car jumped on my back and started gouging my eye,\" he told the Good Morning Wales programme on BBC Radio Wales. \"I realised at that point I was in serious trouble with a large number of people around me and I was by myself.\" He managed to activate his emergency radio alarm but then the assailants threw his radio away. \"I felt completely vulnerable, and completely alone at that point.\" A further scuffle developed with another passenger, before he was hit. \"We were sort of grappling for a short amount of time and at that point he punched me to the face and I fell to the floor in some sort of state of unconsciousness.\" He said a judge described his facial injuries as some of the worst he had seen, when the three attackers were caught and went to court.

Llandudno Magistrates' Court was shown video footage of the men at an animal fight in Cwm Bowydd farm, Blaenau Ffestiniog, in February 2017. They will be sentenced next month. Houlston was also found guilty of other offences related to the welfare of dogs, but not guilty of two charges - wilfully injuring a badger and causing suffering to four dogs. Thomas was found guilty of six other animal welfare offences. Artificial badger setts were found at the farm, which is co-owned by Thomas, along with seven skulls, possibly those of foxes or badgers. District judge Gwyn Jones said pipes were used to hold captive animals and dogs brought to a copse to fight. Allan Armbrister, defending Houlston, who claimed he had not been present at the time of the animal fight, claimed the way the RSPCA had conducted itself had been \"shambolic.\" Clive Rees, defending Thomas, argued that there had been an \"institutionalised and systemic failure\" and identification of his client was unsatisfactory.

The largest one has attracted more than 130,000 signatures since September. Brexit minister Robin Walker said there would be no second referendum and Labour spokesman Paul Blomfield said he understood the \"frustration\" behind the petitions but ruled one out. The SNP's Peter Grant said he would not rule out another Brexit referendum at this stage but added that people had to \"live by the results of their decisions\". The largest petition calls for voters to be given a \"final say\" on the Brexit deal before the 2019 exit date. It proposes a referendum with three options for voters: If no deal has been reached by the date of the referendum, the petition proposes the third option could be removed. The petition was started by Tom Holder, from Southwark, London, who stood for the Liberal Democrats in Castle Point, Essex, in this year's general election. A similar petition last year attracted 4.1 million signatures. During the Westminster Hall debate, Lib Dem MPs, several Labour members and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas called for a referendum to be held on the final Brexit deal reached between the UK and the EU. \"Second thoughts are always superior to first thoughts,\" argued Labour's Paul Flynn. But their calls were dismissed by Conservative Martin Vickers, who said most people who had signed the petitions wanted to change the result of the first referendum. Rather than another referendum, Mr Blomfield said Labour was arguing for Parliament to have the final say.

So how much will change in Mr Obama's second term? That question was, perhaps understandably, barely mentioned in an election campaign that focused on pressing domestic issues and the Arab uprisings. In his victory speech, Mr Obama again made only passing reference to \"a decade of war\" and to \"people in distant nations\u2026 risking their lives right now just for a chance to argue about the issues that matter, the chance to cast their ballots like we did today\". Behind the scenes US diplomacy will no doubt continue to be furiously in demand. No 'Obama doctrine' In the first term, the focus was on headline-hogging conflicts in Ivory Coast, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan and even a close-run election in Zambia. The start of the second term is likely to be preoccupied with more of the same: International efforts to remove al-Qaeda-linked rebels from the north of Mali - by force or negotiation or both - and efforts to ensure that Zimbabwe and Kenya avoid repeating the violence that wrecked their last elections. If Kenya pulls off a free and fair vote, expect a fairly prompt visit to Nairobi by Air Force One. So far, there is no sign of a grand \"Obama doctrine\" for Africa - and perhaps that is a good thing given the diversity and complexity of the continent. Mr Obama has left it to others to warn about the dangers posed by an insatiable China. But his second term may give him an opportunity to move away from the distorting, \"war on terror\" preoccupations of Mali and Somalia, and focus on the broader issues - trade in particular - that he raised \n\nSummary:","116":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But the health board which manages the hospital said no decision has been made on service changes. Managers admit they are trying to recruit more doctors to ensure they can continue to \"maintain safe services\". Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) says Wales Deanery, which provides junior doctors to Welsh NHS hospitals, plans reductions in the number of those being trained in some specialties across Wales along with changes to the number of sites on which they receive training. Wales Deanery says it has been reducing the number of surgical teaching posts gradually at Glan Clwyd to give the health board time to make alternative arrangements. But North Wales Local Medical Committee (LMC) which represents local GPs, is concerned Glan Clwyd will lose out to the region's other district general hospitals at Wrexham and Bangor. Prestatyn GP Dr Eamonn Jessup, chair of North Wales LMC, said: \"As we understand it, the difficulty has arisen because the deanery only wants to support training for junior doctors at two district general hospitals in north Wales, while the health board is committed to providing emergency surgery at three sites.\" 'Ghost town' He said cutting the service at Glan Clwyd would be an \"illogical move\" as the hospital had an \"incredibly\" heavy workload and cutting emergency surgery would put other services in jeopardy. He said the hospital treated a particularly high number of elderly patients, but it was being treated as the \"forgotten ghost town of medicine\". Dr Jessup said he and his colleagues had raised the issue through the British Medical Association (BMA) with the local health board and the Welsh government.

'Policing the present' Stephen's brother, Emmet, said the family had engaged with the HET in a \"very open and honest way\" but felt that the investigation showed favouritism towards security forces. \"Not only was he (the soldier) not prosecuted he was not the designated gunner. \"He actually took the weapon off the gunner and tried himself on two occasions to fire the baton round, which the gun jammed. \"So he had time to see what was happening around him,\" he said. Emmet McConomy said he would be against any suggestions that the Police Service of Northern Ireland could take over some of the historical investigations. \"They should be policing the present. We met with the PSNI a number of years back to ask them what investigations they had conducted into the murder of our brother. \"An 11-year-old child gunned down in his own home town by state forces and the only conclusion they could come to was that the soldier involved, had told them it was an accident.\" \"No Faith\" Emmet McConomy said he believes the very nature of historical investigations in Northern Ireland required an independent body because questions have to be asked of the security forces. \"I feel that in any other line of work you would not be asking your colleagues to investigate an in-house matter. \"I can speak for my family and say that we would have no faith in the PSNI investigating Stephen's murder because they have to question what the RUC did at the time.\" The HET was set up in 2005 as a special investigative unit attached to the PSNI to re-examine the deaths of 3,260 people in Northern Ireland between 1968 and 1998.\n\nSummary:","118":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The secondary school will initially have a temporary home in Hammersmith. Critics say the new-style schools, funded from central rather than local government, will increase divisions in the state system. Free schools are semi-independent and are being set up by groups including parents and charities. The West London Free School will be a mixed school, taking 120 pupils a year. The parents behind the school say they want it to be academically excellent with a \"classical curriculum\", with all children studying Latin up to the age of 14. They say there will be strong discipline and a \"competitive atmosphere\" - particularly in sport - and an ethos which aims to \"instil ambition in all pupils, no matter what their background\". Footsteps There were 445 applications for September and families who applied have begun hearing if their child got a place. Writer and broadcaster Toby Young said: \"We are absolutely delighted and hope that our success inspires other groups of parents and teachers to follow in our footsteps.\" The drive to create free schools is controversial. The government says the programme will improve standards and choice. Teaching unions, Labour and other opponents claim free schools will increase divisions in the state school system and weaken educational services provided by councils because they are directly funded from central government, not through local authorities. So far, there have been 258 applications to set up free schools. Of these, 40 have now been approved to what is known as \"business case\" and nine - including the West London Free School - have passed to what is called \"the pre-opening stage\".

The county council said extra flooding prevention work also had to be carried out. 'Will be frustrating' \"Building a station is a complex civil engineering project and we've needed to work with many organisations. We've had a number of set-backs which were beyond our control and couldn't be foreseen,\" said Mr Botham. \"We know that this will be frustrating for local people, as it is for us, but we are doing all we can to get the station built as quickly as possible,\" he said. The newts - a species protected by law - were found during a routine ecological site survey, the council said, and an application to Natural England for a licence to work on the site has been submitted. The licence sets out what work can be carried out while the amphibians are trapped and relocated.

Jonathan Simpson was convicted of murder at Liverpool Crown Court but has kept how Jacob died a \"murky secret\". Emma Marshall said she would regret leaving her 22-month-old son with Simpson, 25, for the \"rest of my life\". Jacob had suffered a \"catalogue of injuries\" and was taken to hospital after emergency services were called to Belsford Way on 12 July. He died the following day. Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary said Simpson, who had convictions for 31 previous offences, had given \"a variety of accounts\" of how the toddler came by his injuries but all were untrue. \"Only you know precisely what you did that afternoon to hurt Jacob in this way and you have chosen, cruelly and cowardly, to keep that a murky secret,\" he said. \"Instead you have lied and lied again about the cause of Jacob's death.\" The court heard Simpson, of no fixed address but originally from Winsford in Cheshire, had moved in with Miss Marshall in June 2019 after they began a relationship in May that year. She had left the toddler in his care while she went to the hairdressers, the court heard. The judge said he would assume Simpson, was acting \"in a rage\" when he carried out the attack because if it had been \"calculated violence\" it would have been \"unspeakably wicked\". \"You have not shown a jot of regret or remorse about any aspect of the case other than fury about being arrested in the first place,\" he added.

'For ever, for everyone' Now the Friends of Blencathra group, under Ms Cosgrove's leadership, has put in a bid for the \u00a31.75m-priced peak. The group quickly established itself as a charity and started raising funds to buy the mountain after it went on the market two months ago. Its owner Hugh Lowther, Earl of Lonsdale, is selling it to help settle an inheritance tax bill. Friends of Blencathra has expressed concerns about future owners not being \"such good custodians\", after the Lowther family's 400-year stewardship. The National Trust said it would not bid for the mountain, because of \"existing high levels of protection and public access\".

Education spokesman Aled Roberts AM said teachers would have more time with individual children and lesson quality would improve. Classes can have up to 30 pupils. Mr Roberts said it was about giving teachers \"time to do what they do best: teach\", adding: \"The Welsh Liberal Democrats would work to ensure that infant classes normally contain no more than 25 pupils, prioritising the largest classes first. \"We would invest in more teachers, to give them the time to focus on a child's individual needs which we believe is central to raising standards. \"The average class size in Wales is higher than nearly all other developed countries. That simply isn't good enough and our pupils deserve better.\" 'Well received' The National Union of Teachers Cymru hoped the policy would lead to a \"wider debate\" about class sizes ahead of next year's assembly elections. Policy officer Owen Hathway said: \"Infant class sizes have been slowly, but steadily, increasing over a number of years. \"This has a major impact on teachers workload and their ability to spend valuable quality time with their pupils. It has a direct impact on attainment levels. \"Creating a cap of 25 pupils is undoubtedly a proposal that will be well received by the teaching profession across Wales.\" Last month, Welsh teaching union Ucac said schools had been warned to expect cuts of about 16% over the next three years, and suggested class sizes could rise as a result.\n\nSummary:","125":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Owner Catherine Home, whose mother Janet was the pioneering influence behind Scotland's first vegetarian caf\u00e9, told the BBC she is devastated at not being able to keep the family's legacy alive. Mrs Home, who is 70 and lives in North Berwick, said she knew from week one of the lockdown that her mother's business was in serious trouble. She said: \"We had a poor winter and my daughter had moved back from London as the third generation to run the business and we had taken on a couple of key people to help us regenerate but then Covid hit and that was it. \"I was really upset. I feel a real responsibility to look after our mother's legacy, I'm very committed to that, but we were just too deep in debt. \"I am devastated that this has happened. I was 11 when my mother opened her first restaurant and I would go there after school, it was a big part of my life.\" Mrs Home said what her mother had achieved with the business had been \"amazing\" and she had helped make people more aware of what they were eating and why it was important. She added: \"I really wanted to keep my mother's legacy going, I feel so sad that I have not been able to.\" From farm shop to basement restaurant It was in the 1930s that Janet Henderson became very aware that diet was so important, after being introduced to vegetarianism by an aunt in Vienna.

Theresa May has pledged that almost a decade of budget cuts, pay restraint and benefit freezes are nearing an end. Labour says an extra \u00a330bn is needed by 2023, in addition to the \u00a320bn promised for the NHS, to make this a reality. Recent figures showing government borrowing in September was at its lowest level since 2007 has, economists say, given the chancellor greater room for manoeuvre in Monday's statement. In her Tory conference speech earlier this month, the prime minister signalled the improving state of the public finances could see increased support for public services in next year's Spending Review. People needed to know the sacrifices they had made since 2010 had paid off, she said. Ministers have already promised the health service an extra \u00a320bn by 2023. Ask a question Share this chatbot. Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: \"If the prime minister has promised to end austerity, let's have an honest debate about that.\" In a speech on Thursday, the shadow chancellor said the NHS and other public services need help now if Mrs May is to be \"true to her word\". He claimed Mrs May had \"surprised\" Mr Hammond with her party conference announcement after pressure to reverse spending cuts from Labour and her own backbenchers. \"With a bit of chutzpah, which I quite admire, Mrs May threw the architect of austerity, the man who back in the days when the Tories were in opposition designed the austerity programme, she threw him under the proverbial bus with her unilateral announcement of the end of austerity.\" Stopping departmental spending cuts planned for next year will cost \u00a34bn, Labour says, while shelving further budget cuts for the period up to 2023 would cost another \u00a315bn.

Firstly there is Albert Rivera, a dashing 36-year-old Catalan, whose party, Ciudadanos (Citizens) has burst onto the scene, apparently stealing much of the centre ground. And then take Pablo Iglesias, a 37-year-old jeans-wearing, ponytail-sporting former university professor who leads the grassroots, left-wing movement born from the economic crisis called Podemos (We can). His allies swept to power in several big Spanish cities in regional elections back in May. Both men sell themselves as a new brand of politician. Mr Iglesias says the rich should pay more to end poverty and he would force King Felipe to stand in an election for the position of head of state. Mr Rivera is socially liberal, but committed to free-market economics. They both claim they will end corruption. Scandals have plagued Spain's traditional parties in recent years. Making headlines An impromptu exchange on the issue of corruption between Mr Iglesias and Celia Villalobos, a senior figure from the ruling Popular Party (PP), was trending on Twitter this week. She warned him not to go around accusing all of her party of being corrupt. Spain's incumbent prime minister, the slightly dour Galician, Mariano Rajoy, made other headlines. First he was criticised for not appearing in a debate. An empty lectern alongside the three other candidates was one of the top images of the pre-election campaign week. But the contrast between Mr Rajoy's non-appearance, and then his appearance in a Spanish celebrity's kitchen for an overly friendly interview could not have been greater. The latter felt more like a political advert, broadcast on Spain's public broadcaster, TVE. Soft questions, a biography, cheesy music and slow-motion shots of the two men walking only give ammunition to the critics that say Spain's public broadcaster is not independent.

The government had already approved the plan, and Parliament was expected to pass it before the election. But it was put on hold after Labour called for a third unitary council in the county, to serve Northampton only. A government report in 2018 recommended the scrapping of the Conservative-run county council, which twice banned all but statutory spending. A draft Structural Change Order confirmed two \"shadow authorities\" would be set up during a transition period following local elections in May. Labour-run Corby Borough Council was the only authority in Northamptonshire not to lend its support to the proposals. The new North Northamptonshire and West Northamptonshire Councils were due to start operating on 1 April 2021 but the position is now uncertain until after the general election on 12 December. Andrew Lewer, Conservative candidate for Northampton South, said: \"The borough council's own figures, based on research they've done, says it's going to cost an extra \u00a3750 per year for a Band D house in Northampton South for a purely Northampton-based unitary, rather than going ahead with the very prolonged process we've already had for a more sustainable solution for local services.\" Labour candidate for Northampton South, Gareth Eales, said: \"Labour will adopt something that was already part of a report by an organisation called Deloitte, which said the three-unitary solution was the more preferable but the local Conservatives and the government opted to ignore it and went with their own preferred option, which would electorally benefit them.\" Andrew Simpson, Liberal Democrat candidate for Daventry, said: \"We've always said there should be more than just two unitary authorities for Northamptonshire but we've had this imposed on us by the Conservatives and a lot of work has been done to get to this point.

Her father Iain Thacker insisted it would have \"made a difference\" if they had known about an overdose just three months earlier. An inquest heard that the family were not told of the suicide attempt. The hearing at Liverpool's Gerard Majella Courthouse was told that Ms Thacker, from Bradford, had suffered mental health problems since she was 13. The philosophy student was found dead at about 23:30 BST on 11 May last year. Mr Thacker, of Guiseley, Leeds said the family kept in regular contact with her after she moved to university in September 2017. He said she had disclosed her mental health problems when applying to university. However Mr Thacker said the family were unaware she had had an overdose in February and believed she was continuing to take anti-depressant medication. He said: \"Ceara's death was a horrible, terrible shock to us all.\" Her father added: \"We don't know why Ceara didn't feel able to tell us what was going on. \"However, we feel very strongly that someone in a position of responsibility needed to ask her if she wanted us to be told. \"Someone needed to recognise that they were dealing with a really vulnerable 19-year-old who was living away from home for the first time, who wasn't thinking straight, who wasn't coping and who needed her family to support her.\" The court heard on the morning of her death, Ceara had posted on Twitter about the death of Frightened Rabbit singer Scott Hutchison, who took his own life.

A month later, the Nigerian, who goes by the name \"mrwoodbery\" on Instagram, was arrested by Dubai Police for alleged money laundering and cyber fraud. The most famous of the dozen Africans nabbed in the dramatic operation was 37-year-old Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, \"hushpuppi\" or just \"hush\" as he was known by his 2.4 million Instagram followers. Police in the emirate say they recovered $40m (\u00a332m) in cash, 13 luxury cars worth $6.8m, 21 computers, 47 smartphones and the addresses of nearly two million alleged victims. Mr Abbas and Mr Ponle were both extradited to the US and charged in a Chicago court with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and laundering hundreds of millions of dollars obtained from cybercrimes. The two have not yet been asked to plead and are presumed innocent until proven guilty. \"I think there's probably a certain arrogance when they believe they've been careful about maintaining anonymity in their online identities, but they live high on the hog and get careless on social media,\" said Glen Donath, a former senior prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Washington, DC.

In Birmingham, pub bombings coroner Sir Peter Thornton QC is appealing against a legal ruling over whether the alleged bombers can be named in an inquest. Christopher Stanley, from KRW Law, said similar issues may arise in Guildford. Sir Peter had decided the names of the alleged bombers would not be part of fresh inquests, but the High Court quashed the decision. Mr Stanley said the hearings in Woking might coincide with the Court of Appeal hearing on naming the alleged Birmingham bombers. \"Similar issues may arise in the Guildford inquests given the flawed conviction of the Guildford Four and an apparent admission by an IRA active service unit sometime later,\" Mr Stanley said. Surrey coroner Richard Travers will hold the two-day hearing in Woking on 13 and 14 June and is to hear submissions on whether the full inquest should be resumed. The original proceedings never concluded in the 1970s. In Birmingham, 21 people died and 182 people were injured when two bombs went off in city centre pubs in 1974. The Guildford attacks saw five killed and 65 injured. After the attacks, the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four were wrongly convicted while the Maguire Seven were wrongly jailed on explosives charges. All 17 were later released. In 1976, the IRA's Balcombe Street unit claimed responsibility for the Guildford attacks but were not charged. And last year, self-confessed IRA bomb maker Michael Hayes claimed he was part of the group responsible for the Birmingham blasts. No-one has been charged with those bombings since the Birmingham Six were freed in 1991. KRW applied for a fresh hearing into the Guildford attacks after the BBC obtained papers on the case from a controversial inquiry into the miscarriage of justice by Sir John May. Sir John's inquiry ran from 1989 to 1994 and the original Surrey Police inquiry was also reviewed by the Avon and Somerset force \n\nSummary:","134":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Dan Meredith, from RWE npower, said electricity supplies would not be affected. \"Power stations come on and off the grid quite a lot and we're very sustainable, we can carry on.\" The company said it was too early to say how much damage had been caused. In a statement, National Grid said the blaze had \"no operational impact\" on the electricity system. The fire was extinguished at about midnight and no-one was injured. Simon Furlong, assistant chief fire officer, said three fire engines were still at the gas-fired station on Monday morning and he expected them to be there for at least the next 24 hours. \"This was a serious fire which began in one of Didcot B power station's cooling towers and spread to three other cooling towers,\" he said. \"I expect that it will take some time to determine the reasons behind what actually happened.\" Deputy chief fire officer Nathan Travis said an investigation into the cause of the blaze was taking place and said the area affected by the blaze had been \"very badly damaged\". Dave Bray, the fire service's incident commander, said: \"We have extinguished the fire, although there are hot spots that are remaining within the structure. \"It is now the challenge of getting to these and dampening them down.\" Mr Bray said firefighters faced \"significant challenges\" during the blaze because the cooling towers were predominantly made of wood.

Dr Gareth Harvey, a consumer psychologist who studies how retailers try to influence customers, says Black Friday deals are all about grabbing attention with big signs and numbers. \"Shopping in the sales is a very different frame of mind.

But you're not concentrating on the product and whether it is what you want.\" Shoppers in Wrexham who spoke to the BBC conveyed their experiences of online retail therapy.

Passengers will be asked their destination and then asked to pay in advance for their journey. Participating drivers will be issued with computers to calculate the fare. Anyone travelling up to three miles will be charged \u00a320, while a seven-mile journey will cost \u00a330.

The move is part of a deal to transfer all Afghan prisons back to local control ahead of the withdrawal of Nato forces at the end of 2014. Bagram prison has been at the centre of a number of prisoner abuse allegations. Although Afghan President Hamid Karzai has hailed the handover, disagreements with the US remain. Washington is insisting that it will maintain control over some detainees in the prison. Meanwhile, a new report suggests that some Taliban are open to a general ceasefire or political agreement allowing for a continuing US military presence after 2014. 'Glorious ceremony' The handover took place at a brief ceremony which correspondents say was poorly attended by US and Nato officers. \"We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody... and ensured that those who would threaten the partnership of Afghanistan and coalition forces will not return to the battlefield,\" said Col Robert Taradash, the only US official at the ceremony. \"Our Afghan security forces are well trained and we are happy that today they are exercising their capability in taking the responsibility of prisoners independently and guarding the prisoners,\" said acting Defence Minister Enayatullah Nazari. \"We are taking the responsibility from foreign forces.\" AFP news agency photos showed a small group of inmates being released as part of the ceremony. Now officially known as the Parwan Detention Centre, Bagram prison lies about 40km (25 miles) north of the capital, Kabul.

On Tuesday, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the relationship between the two governments was \"regular and thorough\". Mr Drakeford made the comments during an interview with Sky News. His words contrast with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement, in Downing Street on Monday, pledging to \"build the biggest possible consensus across business, across industry, across all parts of our United Kingdom, across party lines\" on how to ease the restrictions. In Wednesday's interview, Mr Drakeford said he had always been in favour of a \"four nation approach\". \"The four nations of the United Kingdom took a decision to go into lockdown on the same day, and with the same measures in place, and my preference is to come out of lockdown in the same way - common measures to a common timetable across the United Kingdom,\" the first minister said. \"But if we can't agree on that and it's a bit of a struggle, I have to say, to get the UK government to engage with us on that agenda, we are preparing our own thinking, our own possible measures.\" Mr Drakeford added: \"My preference is to do it together. \"If we can't reach that point then, of course, my responsibility will be to make the decisions that are right for Wales.\" However, in evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee on Tuesday, Mr Hart said communications between the administrations needed to work in both directions. The first minister had not told him of his plans to publish a framework for ending the lockdown, the previous week, the Welsh secretary told MPs. \"We didn't see that, and it did come out of left field.\" he said.

It also details the rights of Taiwanese investors if they are detained by Chinese authorities and vice versa. China is Taiwan's biggest trading partner with bilateral trade worth $110bn (\u00a370bn) a year. \"The agreement will encourage more mainland investment on Taiwan and give Taiwan investors more room to grow on the mainland,\" said Chinese negotiator Zheng Lizhong. \"It's an important step in deepening economic co-operation.\" Growing scepticism Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou, who won a second term in office earlier this year, has been pushing for closer economic ties with China. The two had signed a landmark trade deal in 2010, reducing tariffs on hundreds of products. However some in Taiwan have protested against the efforts to foster closer relations with China. Critics have argued that such moves will result in increased Chinese economic influence in Taiwan, and may set the stage for an eventual Chinese political takeover of the island. China does not recognise Taiwan, regarding the island as a breakaway province and wants unification. \"I oppose the deals because China is trying to control Taiwan's economy so it can rule Taiwan,\" Chen Che, a protestor who was demonstrating against the signing of the latest pact, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. \"The deals have political purposes and they are steps towards unification.

The footage was \"lost and cannot be recovered\", said Ms Shields. About one-third of all software used by city agencies and departments is believed to have been affected by the attack, which took place in March. Recovery plan Details of the damage done to Atlanta's computer infrastructure emerged during a public meeting held to debate how the city should spend its budget. The hearings revealed that the city has assigned an extra $9.5m (\u00a37.1m) to finance its recovery efforts. At the meeting, officials from the city administration revealed that the attack was more severe than originally thought. More than 140 separate applications were totally or partially disabled by the attack, said Daphne Rackley who heads Atlanta's IT department. About 30% of the affected programs were \"mission critical\" as they were used by either the police or its courts, she said. The municipal courts in Atlanta were shut for several weeks during the height of the attack and huge amounts of legal documents stretching back decades are believed to have been scrambled by the malware. Police chief Shields told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that despite losing the video recordings, no \"crucial evidence\" had been compromised. Dashcam footage was a \"useful tool\" said Ms Shields, but added that other evidence such as the testimony of an officer would \"make or break\" a case. Files on individual officers' computers were also hit in the attack, although much of this data was backed up elsewhere, she said, so was not entirely lost. The hackers behind the infection, known as SamSam, encrypted key data and demanded $51,000 of bitcoins to unlock it.

The system is crawling north-west at a speed of just 8mph, dumping heavy rainfall as it tracks inland. The worst of the storm is expected to hit an area west of New Orleans, and affect the wider region. Thousands have been evacuated from areas most at risk of flooding and other residents have been told to shelter in place. More than 100,000 households in Louisiana are already without power, according to tracking tool poweroutage.us. All flights in and out of Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport on Saturday were cancelled. President Donald Trump declared a federal state of emergency in Louisiana before the storm hit. What is the latest? In its latest update at 16:00 local time (21:00 GMT), the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) confirmed Storm Barry's winds had weakened. But it said \"life-threatening storm surge inundation\" continued as it moved inland. Before it made landfall near Intracoastal City, it was confirmed as the first hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic season. As the storm's rain bands closed in, local journalists shared images of flooding in some residential areas. At least one levee, in Plaquemines Parish in the state's tip, was already overtopped by water by midday on Saturday. Officials have told residents there to immediately evacuate, if it is safe to do so, or risk being cut off for several days. Louisiana's most populous city, New Orleans, looks set to avoid a direct hit from the hurricane - with the worst expected further west near the city of Lafayette instead.

Legal aid minister Shailesh Vara said the latest cut will come into force in England and Wales on 1 July. He said concerns had been \"very carefully\" listened to. Inquiries had reassured the government that \"legal aid reforms so far have not had any substantial negative impact on the sustainability of the service,\" he went on. The decision to scrap cuts to advocacy fees for barristers will be offset by alternative savings in the criminal justice sector, Mr Vara said. 'Hard-pressed litigators' The minister also said plans to bring in new contracts for duty solicitors will go ahead. In March, lawyers lost a court appeal against the plans to cut the number of duty solicitor contracts at magistrates' courts and police stations in England and Wales from 1,600 to 527. Andrew Caplen, president of the Law Society which represents solicitors, said he was \"deeply concerned\". \"The administration of justice is a fundamental duty of government and access to justice is an essential part of that responsibility,\" he said. \"Criminal legal aid solicitors are critical for ensuring that anyone accused of wrongdoing has a fair trial and yet few young lawyers see a future in this work, which is of extreme concern.\" The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, welcomed the decision to protect advocacy fees. But it added it had \"grave concerns\" about solicitors' fee cuts and the dual contracting scheme, which are \"likely seriously to damage access to justice\". Criminal Bar Association chairman Tony Cross said he regretted the decisions to \"impose further fee cuts on hard-pressed litigators\" and to press ahead with the new duty provider contracts.

The energy company denies protesters' claims that the work would have a negative impact on the environment. IGas's appeal is being heard by a government planning inspector. The UK has committed to legally binding carbon budgets, which restrict the amount of greenhouse gases the UK can emit over a five year period. Local MP Justin Madders said production at the Portside North site, if approved, would lead to higher carbon dioxide emissions though. The Labour MP said: \"The more that we look to rely on new forms of energy generation that create carbon dioxide emissions, the less likely we are to be able to meet our climate change commitments.\" IGas wants to conduct flow tests on underground rock formations by injecting acid to \"clear debris\" and establish whether commercial hydrocarbon production can take place. Opponents told the inquiry at Chester Town Hall on Friday that the effects of the test method could be \"similar\" to the effects of fracking. Boreholes were drilled on the land in 2014, making it the first onshore gas site in the UK to be located in a town. Local councillor Pat Merrick told the inquiry: \"I am not opposed in principle to the need to extract shale gas because it's fine in great big open countries, but it is not fine in Ellesmere Port.\" Nicholas Strachan, representing IGas, told the inquiry that the company's test method was \"standard oil field practice\" and would have no environmental consequences.\n\nSummary:","149":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Not yet - and the privacy-conscious way in which they are designed could mean we will never know how effective they have been. Last month, the UK government announced that it was abandoning a centralised NHS contact-tracing app for England and switching to a decentralised version, based on the Apple-Google toolkit. This model has been favoured by privacy campaigners because the matching process takes place on users' smartphones rather on a central computer, providing a greater degree of anonymity. But the government stressed that the new version would not arrive in a hurry, and Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that no country in the world had a functioning contact-tracing app. The Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Keir Starmer, immediately pointed to Germany, as did many others who disputed the prime minister's claim. Germany's Corona-Warn-App was rolled out nationwide in June. A few days ago, the Robert Koch Institute provided an update on its progress, celebrating the fact that it had now been installed by around 16 million people. \"A successful start that speaks for great interest and acceptance among the population,\" a statement from the app's developer said. Bear in mind, however, that there are 83 million Germans, and it is thought more than half of the population need to have an app before it is truly effective. \"The app works\" added the institute's president Prof Lothar Wieler. He went on to say that about 500 app users had tested positive for the virus and \"had the opportunity to warn others via the app\".

The crossings are expected to pass into public ownership from 2018, with some calling for the tolls to be cut. But Prof Stuart Cole said there was little to support claims that charges deterred inward investment or tourists. Motorists only pay to enter Wales across the two bridges while travelling eastbound from Wales into England is free. The tolls for vans and minibuses rose 30p on New Year's Day to \u00a312.40 while tolls for lorries and coaches rose 50p to \u00a318.60. Operated by private company Severn River Crossings Plc, the two bridges are used by about 80,000 vehicles every day. The company's concession will end when takings from the tolls reach \u00a3996m at 1989 prices, predicted to happen in 2018. First Minister Carwyn Jones has called for control of the bridges to be transferred to the Welsh government in at that time. A report commissioned by the Welsh government in November said businesses and consumers spend \u00a380m a year crossing the Severn bridges. It said abolishing the tolls would increase traffic by an estimated 11,000 vehicles a day and could boost south Wales' economic output. A Welsh government spokesman has previously said: \"The UK government control the level of tolls on the Severn crossings, and it is a matter for them to justify this increase to the people of Wales.\" However, Prof Cole, professor of transport at the University of Glamorgan, told BBC Wales: \"The question is, when the [Severn] bridge is transferred in 2018 to the public sector, will it stay with the Department of Transport or will it be transferred to the Welsh government? \"If it comes to the Welsh government, then it has an option of either using it as a revenue generator to pay for other schemes like electrification of the main [railway] line, the new M4 and other schemes, or it can reduce the toll. \"And there isn't enough evidence at the moment to suggest that people are dissuaded \n\nSummary:","152":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Footage showed Joao Alberto Silveira Freitas, 40, being repeatedly punched in the face by the guards at a Carrefour store in Porto Alegre. One of the guards, it has emerged, was an off-duty military police officer. They were arrested, and the Brazilian subsidiary of the French supermarket group Carrefour said it had cut ties with the security firm that provided the guards. Brazil has a long legacy of racism. It was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery, in 1888. Brazilians have traditionally been taught that they live in a racial democracy - President Jair Bolsonaro denies racism exists - but activists say that perception is slowly changing. Video of Thursday night's attack in the southern city of Porto Alegre was circulated on social networks and on Brazilian media - sparking outrage. It showed Mr Silveira Freitas, a welder, being repeatedly punched in the face and head by one security guard while being restrained by another. Another employee appeared to be alongside filming the incident. Reports said security had been called after a female worker at the supermarket had been threatened by a man. On Friday morning, protesters gathered outside the Carrefour in Porto Alegre and in the capital Brasilia, chanting and carrying signs which read \"Ashamed of being white\" and \"Please stop killing us\". Protests were being called for in other cities. The Black Lives Matter movement, which has gained momentum worldwide since the killing of George Floyd in the US in May, has resonated with many Brazilians. In 2019, police in Brazil killed nearly six times as many people as in the US and most of them were black.

Labour peer Lord Harris said Mr Cameron's action \"drives a coach and horses through the draft protocol issued by the Home Office designed to preserve the operational independence of the police.\" 'Exceptional' Writing in his blog, Lord Harris said that while it was desirable to find out what had happened to Madeleine McCann, he did not think senior leadership at the Met would be happy. \"It again embroils their officers in a high-profile investigation, where the chances of success are unclear, and which will divert limited investigative resources away from other matters.\" A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister and Home Secretary Theresa May asked the Met to get involved because the case was \"exceptional\".

Del Rio was jailed for 30 years but was due for release in July 2008, having been granted remission. However, the remission rules were changed in 2006 and Spain decided to postpone her release until 2017. The Strasbourg court said Spain must \"ensure the applicant's release at the earliest possible date\". Spain's Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz says Madrid will appeal against Tuesday's court ruling. Madrid has three months to request that the case be transferred to the European Court's Grand Chamber. The court, whose grand chamber judgments are binding, said Spain had violated two articles of the European Convention on Human Rights in Del Rio's case: Article Seven (the right to no punishment without law) and Article Five (the right to liberty and security). Del Rio was arrested in Zaragoza in July 1988 while driving a car packed with explosives intended for an Eta attack on the Costa del Sol. She was sentenced to more than 3,000 years in jail, most of which was for her role in an attack on the Guardia Civil police in Madrid which left 14 dead and 40 injured, the Spanish news agency Efe reports. That total, for various crimes, was converted into the maximum life sentence of 30 years.

Or - as one doctor put it to me - there has been \"gridlock\". At least in some places. Let's take it step-by-step. Each year more than 14m patients arrive at A&E - effectively the front-door of the hospital. Most of those are dealt with by the doctors and nurses in A&E. But one in four need more complicated care than can be given so are admitted into the hospital. These tend to be the frailest and most vulnerable patients. Once the decision has been made to admit, those patients need to be found a bed. When that has happened, they can receive their treatment and, once they are ready, leave the hospital. But this steady flow can be disrupted at any point - as this graphic below shows. From the figures published by NHS England on Friday, the BBC has been able to analyse data for the last four weeks to see what is happening at all these pressure points. We have then compared the results to the same period the year before. The findings are startling: at every juncture, the problems are getting worse. With A&E units full, ambulances have found it difficult to drop off patients. When they turn up at hospital, it is only meant to take 15 minutes to handover a patients. But over the last four weeks there were over 37,000 occasions when ambulances were left waiting for over 30 minutes. That is more than double the number the year before. Once inside A&E the delays have continued - as we know from the extensive coverage given to how the NHS has been struggling to meet its four-hour target. A growing number of those that are then admitted into hospital are facing long waits (over four hours) for a bed to be found. These are sometimes known as trolley waits. During the last four weeks the number of these has trebled from last year to over 47,000.

It calls for air passenger duty to be reduced for flights from Wales. The Welsh government-owned airport has seen passengers numbers fall to just below one million to March 2013. Passenger numbers had hit a peak of two million in 2007. The airport has also faced competition from its more successful neighbour, Bristol Airport. The latest proposals put forward by a group of academics and business people come as a one-day conference was held in the city. The group says that regional airports have a role to play in reducing the pressure on Heathrow and the other more congested airports - with Cardiff offering more than neighbouring Bristol. Lowering levels of air passenger duty at underused regional airports, such as Cardiff, is the way to do this, says Western Gateway. It estimates Cardiff Airport existing facilities could handle three million passengers a year. The group's report says it expects the airport's connections to improve in time with the high speed rail projects bringing more of the UK within a two-hour travel time, including central London. It said Cardiff would have advantages compared to Bristol Airport - a longer runway and 24-hour operation - potentially giving access to a 4.5m people within a 90-minute travel time. Martin Evans, of the University of South Wales, said: \"Cardiff is very well placed with its infrastructure. It has a runway that is sufficient for long-haul flights, it operates for 24 hours of the day and there are very few people who live in the local area who are afflicted by aircraft noise. \"We feel that the answer to attracting through Cardiff Airport for long haul is to set those rates of air passenger duty lower or even zero. \"This would make Cardiff Airport very attractive both to airlines and to passengers but those powers have to be devolved to the Welsh government if they are to b\n\nSummary:","161":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

What makes his performance all the more remarkable is that he hardly utters a word. The film's only real spoken lines come in a voiceover at the start when Redford's character - known only as Our Man - reads out a valedictory letter to his family and friends. After that he faces high seas and violent storms with an almost silent stoicism. \"If you'd cast Jack Nicholson in the role it would have been a different movie and I'd have rewritten it with a running commentary,\" explains director and writer JC Chandor. \"But Redford has an... innate ability to communicate complex emotional transitions non-verbally.\" Chandor made his name with 2011's talky financial crisis drama Margin Call, a debut feature that earned him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. All is Lost couldn't be more different. Chandor's screenplay was 31 pages of prose description, with no dialogue. A typical film script might have 120 pages. Chandor was inspired to write the film's opening letter on a train journey along the US coast, while he was hard at work editing Margin Call. \"I was taking train rides up and down the eastern seaboard where I could see these middle-class towns where everyone has boats. I wrote this longing, sad letter on one of those train rides.\" Chandor had the idea of casting Redford for All is Lost while at Redford's annual Sundance Film Festival in Utah. During Redford's welcoming speech, a technical hitch meant that a speaker close to Chandor stopped working and robbed the actor of his voice. \"I was struck by the contrast,\" says Chandor. \"Here was this guy across the room I could barely hear. A month later, I couldn't get it out of my head. I offered him the role and expected not to hear anything.\" Five days later Chandor was summoned to meet Redford in Los Angeles. He flew over armed with his flimsy 31-\n\nSummary:","163":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

His heavily pregnant wife burst into tears in the public gallery after the verdict. Mr Palombo, 40, was the eighth banker to have been convicted on Euribor rate rigging charges in Britain in a series of prosecutions brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO). Co-defendant Sisse Bohart, a 41-year-old Dane who also once worked at Barclays, was acquitted at Southwark Crown Court. The jury has yet to reach a decision on a third defendant, former Barclays banker Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old Briton. Euribor is a key euro benchmark borrowing rate, underpinning about $150 trillion (\u00a3113 trillion) of financial products, and the accuracy of the rate is important to maintaining trust in the financial system. The defendants were charged with dishonestly manipulating the rate for their own benefit between 2005 and 2009. The SFO sought a retrial of the three former Barclays traders after the jury failed to reach a verdict in July 2018. At the time, two former Euribor traders were given jail time. Former Deutsche Bank employee Christian Bittar was sentenced to five years and four months. Philippe Moryoussef, a former Barclays trader, was sentenced to eight years but he remains in France after fleeing the UK last summer. He was tried in absentia. Brussels-based Euribor, like its Libor counterpart, reflects the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major lenders report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average. Prosecutors alleged that the bankers manipulated Euribor by nudging them up or down to benefit trading positions, deliberately ignoring rules that they should be set independently. All the former bankers denied any dishonesty, saying they followed instructions and acted openly. Ten bankers have been acquitted of the SFO charges. So far 11 powerful banks and brokerages have been fined a total of $9bn to\n\nSummary:","164":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

For many of Colebrook's residents two floods in two days put Christmas preparations well and truly on hold. \"It's hard to think about presents, trees and parties when you're trying to get sorted,\" one flood victim said. The timing could not have been worse for David Mitchelmore, the landlord of the Colebrook Inn, and while no business wants to lose trade, the flood damage from foul water has kept the pub closed at what is traditionally the busiest time of year. The saturated cob walls will take several weeks to dry out, new floors will have to be laid and the commercial kitchen will have to be professionally deep cleaned before redecorating can be done. \"At the moment we're still emptying about 30 litres of water from the dehumidifiers every two to three days,\" Mr Mitchelmore said. \"I'm going to be closed until 25 January at the earliest - so Christmas just won't happen here. \"December is the biggest month of the year and I was fully booked with functions and parties and it's all gone. \"It's not just the pub, this has affected the whole community and we have to get it sorted because this is devaluing our homes and businesses.\" Some residents have been unable to return to their homes and will be spending the festive period in temporary accommodation or with relatives.

Held up as the embodiment of freedom and equality, it is revered in the US and credited with justifying the resistance to the rule of George III and influencing the Declaration of Independence. In his inaugural address in 1941, President Franklin D Roosevelt said: \"The democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history... It was written in Magna Carta.\" But Magna Carta's status isn't agreed upon by everyone. In his book, A History of Britain, the historian Simon Schama writes that Magna Carta is not the birth certificate of freedom but rather the death certificate of despotism. And Mark Juddery, author of Overrated: The 50 Most Overhyped Things in History, argues that the interpretation of the charter over the centuries as a call for freedom is not the reality of the original document. \"What Magna Carta now means is great, but it did not have such lofty ideals at all,\" he says. \"It was great if you were a nobleman because it gave you the right to land. They really didn't like paying rent. \"That was the main reason they formulated Magna Carta. It wasn't really a case of this feeling that there should be a lot more freedom and that everyone should be equal. \"There was nothing about King John's numerous acts of cruelty and murder.\" Indeed, the majority of the clauses in the original document were focused on rights relating to the barons. And of the 63 clauses, only three have not now been repealed or become obsolete. The most famous of these is: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled. Nor will we proceed with force against him. Except by the lawful judgement of his equals or by the law of the land. To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.\" Despite that clause being the touchstone for countless\n\nSummary:","167":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch did run a version of Android - but after concerns over its interface and battery life, it switched to the Tizen software platform for its latest watch, the Gear 2. Google Glass is the company's main foray into wearables so far. The device includes eyeglass frames equipped with a camera and small display controlled by voice command. The product is not yet on general sale but is being tested by selected people. \"Google is taking wearables seriously and it wants everyone else to,\" said John Delaney, vice-president of mobility research at analyst firm IDC. \"The industry thinks wearables is the next big thing as sales of smartphones start to plateau in developed markets and this is the latest attempt to build momentum behind it,\" he said. \"Google would be a competitor in the market but also an enabler if it helps Android developers.\" Apple is reportedly working on a smartwatch that could use the operating system used on its iPhones and iPads.

The spacecraft went up on a converted intercontinental ballistic missile from Russia's Plesetsk Cosmodrome. It will join an identical platform, Sentinel-3a, which was sent into orbit two years ago. This is now the seventh satellite the EU has lofted in its ambitious Copernicus programme, which seeks to put the biggest volume of Earth observation data ever acquired into the hands of policymakers, scientists, businesses and the general public. Everything the Sentinels observe is open information that anyone in the world can access with a computer and an internet connection. The 3a and 3b missions have been designed to perform a wide variety of roles - everything from measuring the thickness of Arctic sea ice and monitoring wildfires, to assisting with hurricane-forecasting and identifying marine pollution. As with all the Sentinels, the procurement and early operation of 3b falls to the European Space Agency (Esa), the EU's technical agency for Copernicus. But for this new mission, Esa has decided to do something a little different. It has had the Russian Rokot launcher inject 3b just in front of 3a so that the performance of the pair's instruments can be directly compared as they fly over the same piece of Earth. \"3b will fly 210km in front of 3a, 30 seconds in time; and that will allow them to acquire data over more or less the same ground track,\" explained Esa mission scientist Dr Craig Donlon. \"We'll do this for 4.5 months and then we'll drift 3b back into a 140-degree orbit, 50 minutes apart,\" he told BBC News.

Though the MPs passed the bill, they defeated a separate bill giving constitutional status to the ombudsman, a key demand of the Congress party. Campaigner Anna Hazare has called the bill \"useless\" but has ended his fast. He has threatened instead to launch a campaign of civil disobedience that would fill the country's jails. Medics say that the 74-year-old has a fever and high blood pressure which would have got worse if he had continued his fast in Mumbai (Bombay). He had refused to eat since Tuesday. He and his supporters say that tougher measures are required in the bill if it is to prove effective at reducing the level of corruption in India. The BBC's Soutik Biswas in Delhi says that Mr Hazare's crusade is now well on the way to becoming a full-blown, openly political campaign against the Congress party. The Lokpal bill was passed by the lower house of parliament after a debate of nearly 10 hours involving speeches by about 40 MPs late on Tuesday. It is likely to be put to vote in the upper house on Thursday, where it needs to be passed in order to become law. 'Sad day for democracy' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the passage of the bill was a \"special moment\" in the life of the nation. But the Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said it was a \"sad day for democracy\" because the government could not secure the passage of a bill that would have given constitutional status to the ombudsman. The government failed to get the two-thirds majority it needed to make the bill a constitutional amendment.

The group has vowed to step up attacks during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. On Saturday, a suicide car bomb exploded near the capital's parliament building, killing at least four people. The BBC's Mohammed Moalimu in Mogadishu says President Mohamud was attending a function at the residence of the UN special envoy to Somalia, near the airport. A large contingent of the Somali military police accompanied him, leaving the presidential palace, known as Villa Somalia, mainly under the protection of African Union soldiers, he says. The presidential palace is the seat of government and many top government officials live and work there.

'Unusual circumstances' Mr Harrison was retained at the company to keep continuity following the departure of the airline's chief financial officer and chairman in 2009. He was paid the fixed \u00a31m payment for six months work between April and September last year - which includes three months after he left the airline. Easyjet said that the payment to Mr Harrison was a \"one-off\" made in \"unusual and difficult circumstances\". \"The company has now moved forward,\" it added. Easyjet said that there were 172,483,766 votes against the pay report, with 162,073,601 supporting it and 25,306,985 abstaining. But sources at the airline said it was apparent that this was a protest vote against the fixed sum paid to Mr Harrison - and was not a rejection of overall executive pay. Sir Stelios said the result proved many shareholders felt Mr Harrison's compensation was \"undeserved and completely unjustified\". \"I sincerely hope that this is the last time in the life of this company that a bonus is paid without taking the company's financial results into account.\" The airline's annual report reveals Mr Harrison picked up \u00a32.5m in salary and bonuses during 2010, including the \u00a31m fixed cash payment for six months work and \u00a31.2 million under a \"golden handcuffs\" retention deal agreed in May 2009. Sir Stelios claimed he was not consulted on Mr Harrison's fixed-term package either as a director or shareholder. Shareholder advisory group Pirc also advised investors to reject the report. Mr Harrison left Easyjet on 30 June but was available to advise the firm until the end of September. Company reports show that he waived a potential bonus worth \n\nSummary:","181":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

She took out personal loans to cover her gambling debts, but when they became too great she began to submit fake invoices at work. Judge Jonathan Rose sentenced the mother-of-three from Bradford to 20 months in prison. He told her: \"It's accepted by all it is your gambling addiction that drove you to this offending. However your offending represents a gross breach of trust. \"You allowed this to continue and escalate and it was over a protracted period of time and it would have continued had you not been found out when accountants investigated more closely. \"You have lost a great deal from your offending and I'm afraid you must now lose your liberty.\" Leeming was a director at Paul Smith Plasterers in Leeds where she submitted nearly 300 false invoices over a 16-month period. Between February 2016 and June 2017, she altered purchase invoices and created fictitious ones, leaving the firm with a \u00a377,000 VAT liability. In July 2017, her husband Roy, who was also a director, discovered she had been stealing in order to fund her gambling habit. Leeming, of Church Street, Cullingworth, pleaded guilty at Bradford Crown Court to a VAT fraud offence, but the court heard a decision had been taken not to prosecute her for theft from the firm. Lydia Pearce, mitigating, said Leeming had been to counselling for her addiction to online gambling. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Black Friday, the day following the Thanksgiving holiday, is the biggest shopping day of the year in the US. This year it began even earlier amid a trend for Thanksgiving openings. Twelve national chains opened their doors on Thursday, advertising aggressive discounts. Pepper spray Some 15,000 shoppers stormed the flagship Macy's in New York City as it opened for the first time ever on Thanksgiving evening. Pointing at the mobbed department store, Brazilian tourist Luis Figueiro told Reuters news agency: \"This is madness. \"There are so many people here, you can't see any of the things on sale.\" There were several incidents of retail-related disorder across the US: Workers' groups have protested that the trend towards Thursday opening means retail employees can no longer spend the day at home with their families, which is supposed to be the point of Thanksgiving. Protests Some retail analysts have begun to dub the holiday Black Thanksgiving, or Grey Thursday. Workers held demonstrations on Friday outside Walmart stores in the city of Ontario, California, and in Elgin, Illinois, demanding better pay and conditions. There was anecdotal evidence that the Thursday openings have led to an easing off in consumer footfall on Black Friday itself, though the increased popularity of online shopping could be another factor. By late Friday morning, the number of shoppers in many stores was more typical of a normal Saturday than the usual frenetic start to the holiday season. Downtown Manhattan, for example, was busy, but not at saturation level. The US celebration of Thanksgiving is always marked on the fourth Thursday in November. The day after is known as Black Friday because that was the time of year when retailers began making a profit, or moved out of the red and into the black.

He raps his knuckles on the front door of a house in the marginal constituency of Peterborough. \"That was a strong and stable knock,\" he says with a smile. Hani is 16 years old and a passionate Tory supporter. Despite being too young to vote in next month's general election, he is still determined to make his mark. \"I think Theresa May relates to people like me and that's why she would be such a good prime minister,\" he tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

But experts said that smoking carried much greater cancer risks than alcohol, for most drinkers. And the only way to cut the risks from smoking was to quit completely. Government guidelines on alcohol consumption advise men and women to drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week - the equivalent of six pints of average strength beer or seven glasses of wine (or a bottle and a half of wine). The guidance also says there is no \"safe\" level of drinking when it comes to health risk. This study says even moderate drinking can put people at risk of cancer, particularly breast cancer, which is the most common cancer in women in the UK. What are the cancer harms of alcohol? Writing in BMC Public Health, the researchers calculated that if 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lives. In women, alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer and in men, it was linked to cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and liver. For their calculations, the research team from the University of Southampton and Bangor University, used data on cancer risk from Cancer Research UK and data on the number of cancers in the population that could be linked to tobacco and alcohol. Dr Minouk Schoemaker, scientist at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, who conducts research into the causes of breast cancer, said the study offered an \"interesting insight\" but the picture was not simple. \"The overall picture of cancer risk is enormously complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions,\" she said. \"For example, it is difficult to disentangle the effects of alcohol and cigarette smoking entirely, and the study did not take into account the duration of smoking or time since stopping.\" The study only\n\nSummary:","186":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

She's not been to work since 21 December and is running out of money, which means she's been unable to renew her anti-depressants prescription. Since then the US government has been partially shut down, with President Donald Trump refusing to approve a budget unless it includes $5.7bn (\u00a34.43bn) to fund a wall on the border with Mexico - something the opposition Democratic Party has rejected. \"I thought for sure it could not last more than two weeks,\" Jazz, who works as a trainee for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), told Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"Everyone who I was in training with, we were a little excited at the prospect of having a few days off with a shutdown because Christmas was on a Tuesday, so we had Monday and Tuesday off and we thought well, if there's a shutdown for the rest of the week for Christmas, that's OK. \"Obviously now I was a little naive in that because we're in our fourth week. And it's been very difficult.\" The shutdown, which Jazz says she blames on President Trump and \"racist rhetoric in the US\", has affected about a quarter of the federal government - meaning 800,000 employees haven't been paid. Jazz joined the IRS in October and didn't have any savings from her previous job. She says that with no end to the shutdown in sight, she's down to her last couple of hundred dollars - which is needed to help out with rent.

The UK does not yet have widespread 4G coverage, and the iPad will be incompatible with it when it does. The regulator said it had received dozens of complaints in relation to the issue. Apple has declined to comment. The regulator had resolved some of the complaints after discussions with Apple about changes to its advertising, but said it is now looking into further concerns raised by consumers. A letter to one complainant seen by the BBC says that Apple \"have advised us that no further reference to the 4G capabilities of the iPad will be made on their UK website\". The letter goes on to say that this will resolve the complaint, and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) will consequently be closing the file. The ASA told the BBC that when it approached Apple the company said it had removed references to 4G from the webpage subject to the complaint, and had edited a video that contained references to 4G. 'Potentially problematic' But Apple's UK site still offers consumers the chance to buy a \"wi-fi + 4G\" version of the iPad. A footnote explains that \"4G LTE\" is supported only on certain networks in the United States and Canada. The ASA said it had since been contacted by several complainants who had identified other \"potentially problematic claims\" about the iPad and 4G on the website. \"If it appears that the problem claims we asked Apple to remove are still appearing,\" the regulator said, \"we will investigate these new complaints.\" Apple said it would not comment on its discussions with the regulator, but a source at the company insisted that no undertaking was given to remove all references to 4G from its site.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said the jab had the potential to save tens of thousands of lives. But it is not yet clear if it will be feasible to use in the poorest parts of the world. The vaccine needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later. This has been achieved in tightly controlled and well-funded clinical trials, but it is not yet clear if it can be done in the \"real-world\" where access to health care is limited. It is why the WHO is running pilots in three countries to see if a full malaria vaccine programme could be started. It will also continue to assess the safety and effectiveness of the vaccination. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: \"The prospect of a malaria vaccine is great news. \"Information gathered in the pilot programme will help us make decisions on the wider use of this vaccine. \"Combined with existing malaria interventions, such a vaccine would have the potential to save tens of thousands of lives in Africa.\" The pilot will involve more than 750,000 children aged between five and 17 months. Around half will get the vaccine in order to compare the jab's real-world effectiveness. In this age group, the four doses have been shown to prevent nearly four in ten cases of malaria. This is much lower than approved vaccines for other conditions. Malaria vaccine: How good is good enough? It also cuts the most severe cases by a third and reduces the number of children needing hospital treatment or blood transfusions.

Airbus is taking steps to mitigate the impact of Brexit, Mr Enders said. \"Brexit in any form, soft or hard, light or clean - whatever you call it - will be damaging,\" he added. A government spokesperson said it was confident of reaching a good Brexit deal, adding: \"We do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise.\" Mr Enders' comments follow a warning given last month that Airbus could leave the UK if the country leaves the single market and customs union without a transition deal.

This year, the event held without an audience for the first time and broadcast over the weekend of 4-5 April from the World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) training facility in Florida. Fifty-three performers appeared across 18 matches, including one match with five wrestlers and one referee in the ring at once. And another segment saw around 10 people - including recently-signed former NFL star Rob Gronkowski - in a brawl. The broadcast took place days after Florida governor Ron DeSantis issuing a state-wide stay-at-home order as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida reached over 14,000, with 283 deaths. As coronavirus has spread through the US, sports events around the country have been cancelled or postponed. WWE faced calls to cancel Wrestlemania. Critics pointed to Roman Reigns, one of its most prominent wrestlers, who said he \"made a choice\" to pull out of the main event. Reigns has had leukaemia - a type of cancer - and returned to wrestling when it went into remission in 2019. But the programme went ahead. Many of the performers took to social media ahead of the event to argue that the show must go on not despite Covid-19, but because of it. Wrestlemania isn't the only fighting sport that plans to go ahead. Mixed martial arts showcase UFC 249 is still slated to go ahead on 14 April.

We look back at the often chequered history of Banksy's artwork to see what can happen when one shows up in a city. Is it safe from vandals and thieves? Unsurprisingly, given their potential value and public locations, Banksy works have often been targeted by criminals. In January 2019, a hooded group used angle grinders to remove a piece from the Bataclan music hall in Paris. The artwork, which showed a young female figure with a mournful expression, had been painted as a tribute to the victims of the 2015 terror attack at the venue. It was found in Italy earlier this year. A wall mural spelling out \"to advertise here call 0800 Banksy\" was removed piece by piece from a wall in Brick Lane, London, in 2007. Vandals targeted the Nottingham piece within hours of it being painted. Putting it somewhere safe would require removing a piece of wall from a private building and potentially the sign the bike is attached to - a major job which would need the owner's consent. The council opted to put up a Perspex screen, which is an option that has been used by other authorities in the past. So far this and regular monitoring have prevented any permanent damage, but whether it is the long-term solution remains to be seen. Who owns it?

Mr Peyton has recreated an interpretation of the cottage at the bottom of his garden. \"I became fascinated by the whole place,\" he said. \"Eventually my wife and I managed to go and it was one of those magical places. \"I've only ever cried twice when I've visited somewhere but I sat on Samson beach and suddenly the whole story started to all come back to me and it was wonderful, so that's what I've tried to create. \"The neighbours think I'm slightly bonkers because when I'm down there I play the sounds of the seagulls and the sea - I sit down there on a deckchair, with a beer, quite happy.\" Clay holidaymakers in Scilly scenes Fiona Martin, from Walthamstow in East London, would have gone camping on St Agnes in May, with her husband and 12-year-old daughter.

They said it may save companies up to \u00a370m a year in reduced sickness pay and related costs. Labour's shadow work and pensions minister, Kate Green, said: \"Any help to cut number of days lost to sickness is welcome, but with the government's Work Programme helping just 5% of people on sickness and disability benefits into jobs, it is clear much more needs to done to help people get back to work.\" No law change The new scheme will not entail any change to existing laws. At present, staff who are off work for more than four weeks are considered to be long-term sick and entitled to Statutory Sick Pay of almost \u00a390 per week from their employers. That will not change under the new arrangements - but the government wants the Health and Work Service to cut the number of people on long-term sick leave. Under the scheme, employers or GPs will be able to refer employees for a work-focused occupational health assessment. This is intended to identify the issues preventing an employee from returning to work and draw up a plan for them, their GP and their employer, recommending how the employee can be helped back to work more quickly.

The protests were reportedly triggered by a teacher's racist comments - an allegation the police called a \"hoax\". It's the latest violence in the region, which saw weeks of unrest in August. The number of killed is expected to rise as the search for victims continues on Tuesday. Four people died in a separate incident in the provincial capital of Jayapura, bringing the death toll to 27. The incident in Jayapura took place after a mob of students reportedly attacked a soldier and police officers with machetes and rocks. The day of violence came after a period of relative calm in the region, which last month was rocked by mass demonstrations in response to claims of racism. The previous protests stemmed from an incident where nationalist groups accused Papuan university students in Surabaya of damaging an Indonesian flag during Independence Day celebrations. The groups had goaded the students, calling them \"monkeys\", \"pigs\" and \"dogs\". What happened on Monday? On Monday, two separate attacks took place across Wamena and Jayapura in Papua. The violence in Wamena was triggered by racist slurs directed at students by a teacher, said a spokesman for a West Papua separatist group. However, Papua police denied this, calling it a \"hoax\".

It prompted a public outcry and demands for the government to act. Last week, Canberra suspended exports to abattoirs shown in the programme, but now it has issued a blanket ban. Indonesian officials have rebuffed claims of widespread animal cruelty in their abattoirs. Bayu Krisnamurti, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, told the BBC that the coverage had created a negative perception of Indonesia overseas. \"I think ABC practised unfair journalism, only the bad practices were portrayed. We see this as an isolated incident. \"It's against the law in Indonesia to be so harsh and cruel to animals. Indonesian regulations explicity say we must practise animal welfare in handling animals in the slaughterhouse.\" He acknowledged that it could hurt the country's ability to procure cattle. He said that New Zealand and the US were being looked at as possible alternative suppliers, but Jakarta had not yet contacted either. Farmers' warning The ban is the result of public revulsion and outrage at the gruesome footage from Indonesia's abattoirs that was broadcast last week in an ABC TV documentary, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney. It showed steers being whipped, beaten and slashed repeatedly, and suffering terrible pain before they are slaughtered. Australia first announced a ban on live exports to the 12 abattoirs featured in the programme. But the public demanded more, signing online petitions to halt the trade with Indonesia and pressing lawmakers in Canberra to bring in a complete ban, our correspondent says.

The president said the second biggest rebel group, the ELN, had also indicated a readiness to talk. 'Learning from mistakes' Mr Santos gave no details about the exploratory talks with the left-wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). According to the regional media network Telesur, negotiators from the two sides signed a preliminary agreement in the Cuban capital Havana on Monday. Telesur said the first round of peace talks would be held in the Norwegian capital Oslo on 5 October. Negotiators would then continue holding talks in Havana, it added. Referring to previous failed talks with the Farc during the government of then-president Andres Pastrana, Mr Santos said his government had \"learned from the mistakes committed in the past\". Mr Santos said military operations would continue and that \"each centimetre of the country would have a military presence\". As part of the peace talks launched in 1998, Mr Pastrana had granted the Farc a safe haven the size of Switzerland in the south-east to help move peace talks along. The zone was off-limits to the army and the rebels used it to train and regroup. Mr Pastrana ordered the rebels out of their safe haven after the peace talks failed in February 2002, but part of the area remains a rebel stronghold to this day.

Det Con Craig Spenceley, of Cleveland Police, described Nixon's actions as \"unforgiveable\" and \"absolutely horrific\". \"He targeted a young family in their own home a week before Christmas, which should have been an exciting time for them. \"Not only did Nixon rob them of their belongings, he also tried to stab one of the victims in front of his own child and made them all suffer through an incident which can only be described as a nightmare.\" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Her comments come as part of a review requested by the government into the \"victim contact scheme\". Two victims are set to begin a High Court battle against releasing Worboys. Dame Glenys's paper said \"poor\" correspondence included letters with errors in the women's names and addresses. She said the National Probation Scheme (NPS) \"generally complied with the scheme provisions\", but that these mistakes suggested \"a lack of care or concern\". \"Those women not in contact with the scheme - the majority - learnt of the decision through the media. All who spoke to us described their shock and distress,\" she added. \"They had not felt prepared for this outcome.\" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences in 2009. He drugged his female victims before attacking them in his black cab. Before Worboys's parole hearing, the NPS attempted to contact women who had not opted into the victim contact scheme. But there was not enough time before the hearing for them to receive or absorb the letters, the report said. \"What is more, the style and content of the letters lacked clarity and urgency,\" it added. \"One woman who had engaged with the scheme from the start did make a Victim Personal Statement to the Parole Board. \"Others who we interviewed were adamant that they would have wanted to do so, had they had the opportunity.\" What is the Victim Contact Scheme? The VCS, run by the NPS, supports victims of violent or sexual crimes where the defendant is sentenced to at least a year in prison or has been detained under the Mental Health Act. After defendants are convicted, victims are asked if they want to opt into the scheme. If they do, they are given a Victim Liaison Officer (VLO) who keeps them informed about the offender. Updates might include a release date, licence conditions, or if the convict is moved to an open prison.

Darius Barnes is a Broadway dancer and choreographer who until March was in the Tina Fey musical Mean Girls. He's already working on the new Michael Jackson show MJ, now scheduled to hit Broadway next year. He could have found time hanging heavy after the coronavirus pandemic closed all New York theatres on 12 March. Instead, he's one of a group of ambitious African American theatre practitioners pulling together the inaugural Antonyo Awards. He says the awards, whose name is a riff on the long-established Tonys, are a celebration of black theatre talent and blackness in general. \"We wanted to do something to uplift the black theatre community and the contribution it's made to Broadway and off-Broadway theatre,\" he says. Barnes says it's just chance that the Antonyos are launching in the year of Covid-19. \"But I think actually they might have been harder to get started in normal times - everyone in New York theatre is always crazy busy. \"But now everyone's at home working through Zoom or whatever and they had a little more time to donate their talent and record material for this week's show. I don't know if a live red carpet event would ever have happened this quickly.\" The ceremony is online on Friday, 19 June - or \"Juneteenth\", the anniversary of the end of slavery in 1865. Presenters will include Audra McDonald, one of Broadway's most acclaimed stars, and Titus Burgess of the Netflix series Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Around 8,000 people voted online for theatre talent shortlisted in almost 30 categories. Some are the performance categories you would expect, such as best actor in a play. But executive producer Drew Shade says it's equally important to look at black talent in less glamorous areas such as best lighting design and best sound. \"There's a huge gap in the representation of people of colour i\n\nSummary:","200":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

According to the rules, MEPs cannot vote on behalf of another MEP. The accusations are the latest in a series of controversies involving the right-wing politician in recent months. Last week she appeared in court accused of inciting racial hatred. She denied committing any offence when she compared Muslims praying in the street to the Nazi occupation. In the latest scandal on Wednesday, the vice president of her political group is alleged to have voted for himself as well as for Ms Le Pen at least eight times. \"She just got up and left in the middle of the voting session, and you can clearly see National Front Vice President Marcel de Graaff voting for her,\" parliament spokeswoman Marjory Van Den Broeke told the BBC. Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP group in parliament. said that in the light of the accusations, he will send a letter to European Parliament President Martin Schulz, asking him to open a formal investigation into matter. Mr Schulz's office told the BBC that he is looking into the allegations. He has the power to sanction MEPs by suspending them, fining them, or cutting their daily allowance. But Ms Le Pen is quoted by French media as saying that even if there was a breach of parliamentary procedures, Mr de Graaff will have to take responsibility for it rather than her. Her anti-immigration and anti-EU message is attracting increasing support in France and her party is hoping to win two French regions in December's local elections.\n\nSummary:","201":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The sites had seriously violated reporting rules, officials said. China has tightened controls on online communications in recent years. Most Chinese news sites are prohibited from gathering or reporting on political or social issues themselves, and are instead meant to rely on reports published by official media, such as state news agency Xinhua. However, many news organisations had hired investigative journalists to produce their own reports, to cover major social issues and attract more readers and revenue. Now, several major online news columns, such as Sina's News Geek, Sohu's Click Today, and NetEase's Signpost, have all been closed, along with related social media accounts, newspapers Beijing Daily and the Beijing News reported. They had \"published large amounts of independently-gathered news reports, in serious violation of the rules\", and could also face fines, the newspapers added. News outlets in China operate under tight Communist Party control, with censorship and self-censorship common. Thousands of cyber-police also watch the web and social media, and material deemed politically and socially sensitive is filtered. In February, Chinese President Xi Jinping toured state media outlets, and said journalists must give absolute loyalty to the Communist Party.\n\nSummary:","202":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

She had been named as a favourite to take over from C4 chief executive David Abraham, who is stepping down. A decision on his successor is expected to be announced within days. 'Business as usual' Hunt became the channel's chief creative officer in 2011, having previously been BBC One controller. As well as buying Bake Off, which was broadcast originally BBC Two and then BBC One, she bought the UK rights to The Handmaid's Tale, which first aired last weekend and was met by critical acclaim. She said she was looking forward to \"an exciting summer of sport\" and \"the richest autumn schedule we've ever had, with big shows from the Great British Bake Off to Electric Dreams\", promising it would be \"business as usual\" until she leaves. In a statement, she said: \"I've loved being at Channel 4 and am incredibly proud of how far we have come creatively. From the multiple channel of the year awards to the raft of global hits, we've had real success. \"I've been lucky to have a superlative boss in David Abraham and to have been supported by the best commissioning team in the business.

Women and equalities minister Nicky Morgan said the move was a \"first step\" but would \"concentrate minds\". The TUC said the measures should include medium-sized businesses and come with fines for non-compliance. The Chartered Management Institute said the new legislation would \"force transparency\" on companies. The plan on bonuses is the first of a number of \"equality-boosting measures\" to be set out in detail this week and hopefully introduced in the first half of 2016, according to Downing Street. Other steps include: Details of exactly what companies must publish and when the scheme will begin will be announced after the results of a consultation, which concluded in September, are released. 'Concentrate minds' More than 10 million workers will be covered by the new transparency rules - although far fewer than that receive bonuses. The measures are contained in the Equality Act 2010, which was introduced by Labour but blocked from implementation by the Conservatives until now. Latest figures show that, overall, women in the UK earn 19% less than men. Up to the age of 40, there is very little difference between the earnings of men and women. But beyond that age, when more women are likely to have taken time out to raise families and work part-time, there is a significant gap. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said publishing salary and bonus information was a \"start\" - but employers needed to look at why women were still being paid less than men and \"do something meaningful about it\".

Ineos and Reach CSG claim ministers acted illegally in announcing the block in October 2017. Government lawyers told the court a ban was not in place and that a final position had yet to be adopted. Tom Pickering, who is operations director for Ineos Shale, said that that claim represented a \"staggering U-turn\". He explained: \"The position of the Scottish government that has now been stated in court represents a staggering U-turn on the policy direction announced by the energy minister during parliamentary debate in October last year and by the first minister when she said in parliament 'Scotland should welcome the fact that fracking in Scotland is banned'. \"The Scottish people and parliament may find this revelation barely believable when the government has repeatedly told Holyrood that there is an effective and immediate ban.\" The Scottish government announced a moratorium - or temporary halt - on fracking in 2015 while it sought the opinions of experts and the public on whether the controversial oil extraction technique should be allowed in Scotland. After considering the evidence for two years, ministers concluded there was \"overwhelming opposition\" and announced what was described at the time as an \"effective ban\", enforced via planning powers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later told the SNP conference that \"fracking is now banned in Scotland\". According to papers lodged at the Court of Session, Ineos argued that the October announcement represented a change of policy by the government.

Conservative rival Matthew Paul said it was \"possibly the most sycophantic thing\" he had ever seen. Plaid Cymru claimed he was \"bitter\" and the Tories were becoming \"desperate\". The leaflet, delivered to homes in the constituency, reads: \"Once in a generation a politician emerges who stands alone in ability - a politician with visionary ideas.\" It continues: \"Adam is an X-Factor politician, labelled by some the 'Mab Darogan' - Prophetic Son - of Welsh folklore. \"He became one of the most formidable politicians in Westminster.

The comments come amid fresh peace talks in Geneva aimed at resolving the five-year Syrian conflict. Russia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose office said in a statement he had agreed to the move. The pullout was \"in accordance with the situation on the ground\", the statement said. Russia began its campaign of air strikes in Syria last September, tipping the balance in favour of the Syrian government and allowing it to recapture territory from rebels. \"I consider the mission set for the defence ministry and the armed forces on the whole has been accomplished,\" Mr Putin said in a meeting at the Kremlin. \"I am therefore ordering the defence ministry to begin the withdrawal of the main part of our military force from the Syrian Arab Republic from tomorrow.\" Putin may be hedging his bets: Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent When Russian air strikes began in Syria, President Assad's regime was on the brink of collapse. Less than six months later, Russia says its action allowed Syrian government troops to retake 10,000 sq km (3,860 sq miles) of territory. By intervening, Vladimir Putin made clear that Russia was prepared to assert its interests. The results ensure Moscow a bigger say in what happens at the peace talks. The decision to scale down Russian operations may partly be fuelled by cost, given falling oil prices; it could also be driven by a desire to end Russia's isolation and Western sanctions. But whilst Vladimir Putin has ordered his foreign minister to focus efforts on the political front in Syria, he appears to be hedging his bets. Critically, sophisticated air defence systems seem set to stay. And as we have never been told officially how many troops were ever sent to Syria, we are unlikely to know how many will remain.

All other English universities have agreed to treat Channel Islands students the same as their UK counterparts when fees for new courses jump from just over \u00a33,000 a year to a maximum of \u00a39,000 from 2013. Deputy Robert Sillars said: \"We're trying very hard to bring these four [universities] back in line.\" 'No justification' Mr Dunn said the decision had been prompted by a relaxation of rules regarding what fees can be charged by universities. He said: \"We are now left to decide what is equitable. \"We have to decide what that means in terms of the impact on other non-EU students who may see us offering something to Jersey and Guernsey which they don't receive.\" A statement from Cambridge University read: \"The university does not see any justification for maintaining a reduced rate of unregulated fee charged solely on the basis of particular domicile. To do so would be discriminatory.\" Cardiff University will be charging students from the Bailiwick higher fees, but islanders won't be treated as international students. A spokesperson for the university said the fees would be higher because Wales did not provide funding to Guernsey students.

When Ceefax was launched in 1974, he updated all 24 news pages on his own, feeding punch tape into machines. When he retired in 1982, Ceefax had a 20-strong team. It went on to attract 22 million viewers a week and inspired teletext services around Europe. Ceefax will end its transmissions in October when the digital switchover is completed. McIntyre's death comes just four weeks after the service was switched off in London. The technology for the world's first teletext service was developed by BBC engineers who were trying to find ways of providing subtitles on TV programmes for the deaf, rather than produce a news service. They found that it was possible to transmit text information in the \"spare lines\" transmitted on the analogue TV signal. McIntyre, who had worked at the BBC since 1952 including a spell as a correspondent based at the UN, was then appointed as the first editor of the service. At one stage, he had the country's only Ceefax-enabled TV set at his home. In Ceefax's early days he worked regular office hours so the service was not updated in the evenings or at weekends. The audience take-up rate was slow for the first seven years, because of the expense of the decoders needed to broadcast Ceefax onto TV sets, but soon the service expanded year by year. He took early retirement at the age of 55 to write books, while acting as a teletext consultant in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. His publications included a book called \"Monuments of War: How to Read a War Memorial\" and World War II At Sea. He also became one of the Oasis poets - World War II servicemen who wrote poetry about their experiences between 1939 and 1945.

The following are the UN resolutions relating to Iran's nuclear programme. DEMAND TO END ENRICHMENT - RESOLUTION 1696 In March 2006, the issue was discussed at the UN Security Council, which called for a report by the IAEA to establish Iran's compliance with the terms of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). The treaty allows for the use of nuclear technology for peaceful energy purposes, as long as countries can demonstrate that their programmes are not being used for the development of nuclear weapons. In July 2006, the Security Council said it was \"seriously concerned\" that the IAEA was unable to provide assurances about Iran's undeclared nuclear material. It demanded that Iran \"suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research and development\", giving it one month to do so. Failing that, it would face the possibility of economic and diplomatic sanctions. Iran asserted that its nuclear programme was for civilian use permitted by the NPT. On this basis it said it rejected the validity of the Security Council's calls. It claimed that while subscribers to the NPT were being punished, those who had not signed up to the agreement were being rewarded by generous nuclear cooperation agreements. RESOLUTION 1696 FIRST ROUND OF SANCTIONS - RESOLUTION 1737 The deadline for Iranian compliance with the Security Council's demands passed without being heeded. In December 2006, the Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1737. This called on states to block Iran's import and export of \"sensitive nuclear material and equipment\" and to freeze the financial assets of those involved in Iran's nuclear activities.

Mr Ahmed and his wife Farzana Ahmed, 49, of Warrington, both deny murdering their 17-year-old daughter. Shafilea disappeared in September 2003 and was found on the bank of the River Kent in Cumbria in February 2004. Her emergency accommodation application was read to the jury by Andrew Edits QC, for the prosecution. Under the heading 'Reasons for leaving home', Shafilea, whose 26th birthday would have taken place on Saturday, wrote: \"Forced into arranged marriage in Pakistan\". 'Regular violence' Mr Edis said that under the heading 'Nature and incidents of violence', Shafilea wrote: \"Regular incidents since I was 15 or 16. One parent would hold me while the other hit me. \"I was prevented from attending college and my part-time job. I'm scared of going back to my parents and frightened enough to flee my home.\" Mr Edis said to taxi driver Mr Ahmed: \"That's a tissue of lies, according to you, isn't it?\" The defendant said: \"Yes.\" The barrister continued with Shafilea's statement, in which she said: \"There has been a build-up to the violence towards me and my mother told me I was about to go to Pakistan for an arranged marriage and my mother had begun to pack. \"My parents had been into school and told my teachers I would be absent and going to Pakistan.\" Mr Edis said: \"Shafilea feared she was going to be married off, that's her perception isn't it?\" Mr Ahmed said: \"This paperwork Shafilea filled in, what she's put down was not true.\" Daughter's evidence The prosecution claims she was killed by her parents because she brought shame on the family by her desire to lead a westernised lifestyle.

Aamir Siddiqi innocently answered his door expecting to see his local imam for a Koran lesson. Instead he was confronted by two balaclava-clad knifemen who pushed their way in and stabbed him to death. The attackers, Ben Hope and Jason Richards, wielded daggers over their heads and howled as they set upon helpless Aamir. He was the wrong target in the wrong house. His sister Miriam has described 11 April, 2010, as \"a normal lazy Sunday morning\" at the family home in the city's Roath suburb. She and her husband, who had stayed over the previous night, had not long left to pick up a takeaway for Aamir. The 17-year-old was revising upstairs at home in Ninian Road when the doorbell rang. The bright, ambitious A-level student wanted to become a lawyer and was hoping to read law at Cardiff University after sitting his exams that coming summer. Aamir was expecting his Koran teacher that afternoon and called to his parents Iqbal and Parveen Ahmad that he would answer the door. But instead of the imam come to teach religious texts, there stood Richards and Hope, masked and fuelled up on heroin. They murdered Aamir before he had the chance to say a word. After realising in those first awful seconds that it was not a joke or an attempted robbery, his parents leapt to his defence. Mr Ahmad said during Hope and Richards' trial that he used all his strength to try to push one attacker away from Aamir but he was not strong enough. He was slashed twice and left bleeding. The other attacker chased Aamir into the dining room. Mrs Ahmad jumped onto his back and grabbed his jacket but she was also cut with the knife.

However, the government said in August they must change because the European Commission owned the copyright. Now it says the Australian government has agreed to supply alternatives. The change is one of many small ways in which a \"no-deal\" Brexit could affect British life, flagged up by government departments via \"technical notices\". Others included the possibilities of Britons needing international driving permits for European countries, an end to using mobiles free from roaming charges and additional credit card fees. The notices set out the approach to minimising disruption across industries as wide-ranging as shipping, agri-foods, pharmaceuticals and satellite technology. Ministers insist a \"no-deal\" scenario remains unlikely, although No 10 accepts \"big issues\" must be resolved before an agreement can be reached. Requesting feedback on its contingency plans, the Department of Health says there would have to be changes to the way manufacturers were asked to notify UK health and regulatory bodies about the sale of both e-cigarettes and tobacco products. In the event of a \"no-deal\" Brexit, it adds: \"Manufacturers will need to ensure that tobacco products produced from exit day onwards feature new picture warnings, which have been secured by agreement with the Australian government. \"Tobacco products featuring pictures from the EU library, produced before exit day, may be sold for 12 months after exit day.\"\n\nSummary:","224":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Colin Noble, 49, who was based in Stechford, Birmingham, was acquitted of misconduct in a public office in 2019. The ongoing hearing at the force's headquarters will decide whether his actions amount to gross misconduct. Presenting counsel Barney Branston told the panel publicity from the criminal trial at Birmingham Crown Court had prompted other women to come forward. He said the domestic abuse investigation officer, who had 17 years' experience, showed an \"astonishing lack of respect for vulnerable people\", bringing \"discredit\" to the police service. \"PC Noble significantly overstepped the mark as to how he should have behaved - seeking to have personal relationships with all these women,\" he said. One woman, known as Miss X, secretly recorded a conversation with the officer in which he made comments such as \"we could be good together\". She told the panel PC Noble asked her to unbutton her shirt and asked to \"see what you are working with\" while looking at her breasts. He also allegedly asked her, \"How many guys have you had on the go?\" before telling her he was a \"red-blooded male who wanted to see women in all their glory\". Miss X said the encounter had left her reluctant to contact the police and like she \"couldn't trust anybody\". \"This was egregious behaviour toward Miss X,\" Mr Branston said. \"She was clearly uncomfortable with his behaviour. He knew he was brazenly crossing the line but proceeded in doing so.\" Other allegations include visiting one victim when there \"was no good reason\", visiting another woman at her private address rather than a police station after she reported domestic abuse allegations and pursuing a woman charged with a criminal offence while she was on bail.

The atmosphere was positively toxic. Labour MP Paula Sheriff called on the prime minister to \"moderate\" his language and stop referring to the Act of Parliament ordering him to seek a Brexit extension as the Surrender Act. Referring to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, she said: \"Many of us in this place are subject to death threats and abuse every single day. \"Let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words - surrender act, betrayal, traitor - and I, for one, am sick of it.\" Mr Johnson replied: \"Mr Speaker, I have never heard such humbug in all my life.\" The PM went on to claim that the best way to honour the memory of Ms Cox, a Remain supporter, would be to deliver Brexit. It sparked a backlash from opposition MPs and Ms Cox's family - but the PM has rejected calls to apologise for the remarks. He has said \"tempers need to calm down\" and insisted that he \"totally deplores any threats to anybody, particularly female MPs\". But he added: \"I do think in the House of Commons it is important I should be able to talk about the Surrender Bill, the Surrender Act, in the way that I did.\" Analysis of Hansard, Parliament's official record, shows that Mr Johnson has never used the word \"traitor\" in the Commons, as his critics claim. He has said \"betrayal\" before, on 15 October this year, when he accused Jeremy Corbyn of \"a shameless U-turn and a betrayal of millions of people who voted leave\". He used the word \"betray\" in his statement on Wednesday night, saying: \"We will not betray the people who sent us here; we will not.\" And of course, intemperate language is used on all sides.

It uses assumptions about births, deaths and migration to project population changes. It predicts that the working-age population will rise by less than 1% but the population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by almost 26%. The report also assumes that the level of migration to Northern Ireland will continue to be very low. It breaks down population changes by local government district and predicts the largest rise of 10.4%, or 21,400 people, in Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon. Growth The smallest increase is predicted for Derry City and Strabane, up by 1.5% or 2,200 people. Derry City and Strabane is one of seven out of 11 areas projected to see a decline in their work-age populations. Over the longer term, the population of Northern Ireland is projected to reach two million by mid-2034. By mid-2038, annual population growth is projected to fall below 0.2% for the first time since mid-1999, due to a falling number of births and rising number of deaths as a result of an ageing population. The population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 74.4%, or 498,500 people, from mid-2014 to mid-2039, with the result that one in four people (24.7%) will be in this age category.

An inquest found neglect contributed to the death of Connor Sparrowhawk, 18, at Slade House in Oxford in 2013. The trust said it was \"completely focused\" on tackling the concerns. Last year an independent report blamed a \"failure of leadership\" for failing to investigate the unexplained deaths of hundreds of patients. It was ordered after Mr Sparrowhawk was found unresponsive n the bath following an epileptic seizure at the Oxford learning disability unit, which has since closed. The CQC found the trust's investigation of incidents, including deaths, was not robust enough. 'Longstanding risks' It said not enough was done to learn from incidents to prevent future risks to patients, and concerns raised by patients, their carers and staff were not effectively responded to. Dr Paul Lelliott, CQC deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said the safety of patients with mental ill health and or learning disabilities required \"significant improvement\". \"We found longstanding risks to patients, arising from the physical environment, that had not been dealt with effectively. \"The Trust's internal governance arrangements to learn from serious incidents or investigations were not good enough, meaning that opportunities to minimise further risks to patients were lost,\" he added. 'Worrying' Health service regulator, NHS Improvement, said it would impose management changes at the trust if progress is not made on fixing the concerns raised by the CQC. Executive medical director Dr Kathy Mclean said: \"Patients and service users at Southern Health expect to get safe and good quality care, and it is worrying to see that the CQC have identified patient safety concerns which have still gone unaddressed at the trust. \"If we don't see enough progress on this we will consider taking action on behalf of patients,\" she added.

She was later diagnosed with meningitis which caused brain damage and she died in her sleep in Florida in 2013. A jury inquest will investigate her diagnosis and treatment in 2006. Kate's mother Diane told the hearing in Abergele how she sought medical help after her daughter began vomiting green mucus on 29 March 2006. An out-of-hours GP referred her to the children's ward at Wrexham Maelor where a doctor diagnosed tonsillitis. He ruled out giving Kate, from Rossett, Wrexham, any antibiotics because he said it was a viral infection, but the family asked for a second opinion. The doctor said he would check with his boss but returned 45 minutes later claiming his superior had said the family was free to go. Kate's condition deteriorated and on 31 March she was diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis. She was rushed to Alder Hey children's hospital in Liverpool but she had already suffered severe brain damage. Her parents were told she was not expected to survive, but after several months in intensive care she was released from hospital and told she needed 24-hour care for the rest of her life.

Eventually, the government had to take over what had been private legislation to gets its way - and parliamentary procedures were changed as a result. The proposed Severn barrage is equally controversial and many of the arguments are familiar. Its supporters say it will bring jobs - its critics say it will damage the environment. Its impact is so great, parliament will have to pass a special law before it can go ahead. This morning, MPs on the energy and climate change committee began their inquiry into the scheme, taking evidence from supporters such as Neath MP Peter Hain and opponents such as the National Trust. The sharpest divergence of views came over the impact of the scheme on fish in the Severn estuary. Peter Hain said the scheme's turbines would be \"fish-friendly\" although he couldn't guarantee that no fish would be hurt in the making of this barrage. Martin Salter, a former Labour MP who now works for the Angling Trust, told the committee: \"Peter talked as if it was a good thing that the turbines would be operating 24\/7 - well that's 24\/7 fish-mincing.\" Mr Salter said the impact could be devastating and to argue that the barrage would be fish-friendly was \"absolute guff\". I guess you could debate how \"fish-friendly\" angling is but the committee appeared sceptical about what he felt was a lack of detail provided by the schemes's promoters, Hafren Power and about the price the consortium would want for the energy generated. Barrage supporters hope the UK government will give the go-ahead for the scheme this year, amid fears that the Middle East money backing the scheme may not be on offer for long.

Medical staff will get 'breaking news' style alerts about their patients. Privacy campaigners are concerned about data breaches. Information on more than 1.6 million patients a year will be shared with a subsidiary of Google. Under a five-year agreement, DeepMind will collaborate with Barnet, Chase Farm and Royal Free Hospitals using a mobile app called Streams, which will initially alert clinicians to patients with signs of acute kidney injury at its earliest stages. All data will be encrypted, and will not be shared with Google, despite its ownership of DeepMind. The app will be rolled out from early next year, and if successful will also be used to detect other life-threatening illnesses like sepsis and organ failure. Paper free Whereas doctors and nurses at the Royal Free currently have to leaf through patient notes to build a picture of a patient's blood results over time, they will now be able to access years of data at their fingertips.

You can read all about that here. That rather took the spotlight off what was meant to be the main event. For the second week running, Jeremy Corbyn focused his firepower on the government's handling of Brexit, mining the rich seam of material offered to him by Boris Johnson's leaked remarks to a private dinner. Why didn't Mrs May take the foreign secretary's advice and ask Donald Trump to take over Brexit negotiations, he asked. The PM was initially unable to answer as she was drowned out by the noise of MPs. Mrs May eventually managed to get her reply in - a swipe at Labour's position. MPs then fell silent as she made a detour to talk about the first anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire - a subject raised by Mr Corbyn at the start of his question. She said all of the 203 families left homeless by the tragedy had been offered new permanent or temporary accommodation and 183 had accepted an offer of a permanent home. She then paid tribute to the \"dignity and strength\" the victims of the fire had shown. Mr Corbyn also paid tribute to the families - but said the \"reality\" was that some of them still did not have homes. Turning back to Brexit, he asked whether the transition period would go on until December 2021. The PM guessed he was talking about the \"backstop\". She gave him a lecture on what the backstop is and why the government does not expect it ever to be used. \"I am not really sure whether it is a backstop or a backslide she is taking about here,\" said Mr Corbyn.

They said the species had one fewer finger on each forearm compared with its close relatives, suggesting an adaptability that enabled the animals to spread during the Late Cretaceous Period. Several complete skeletons of the feathered, omnivorous creatures were unearthed. The animals, which grew to two metres long, had a large, toothless beak similar to the type seen in parrots. It is the first evidence of digit loss in the three-fingered family of dinosaurs, known as oviraptors. The team said the discovery that the dinosaurs could evolve forelimb adaptations suggested they could alter their diets and lifestyles, and potentially diversify and multiply. The team also discovered that Oksoko avarsan, like many other prehistoric species, were social as juveniles. The fossil remains of four young dinosaurs were preserved resting together. Dr Gregory Funston, of the University of Edinburgh's school of geosciences, said the discovery shed light on how a group of parrot-like animals thrived more than 68 million years ago. \"Oksoko avarsan is interesting because the skeletons are very complete and the way they were preserved resting together shows that juveniles roamed together in groups. \"But more importantly, its two-fingered hand prompted us to look at the way the hand and forelimb changed throughout the evolution of oviraptors, which hadn't been studied before. \"This revealed some unexpected trends that are a key piece in the puzzle of why oviraptors were so diverse before the extinction that killed the dinosaurs.\" The study, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, was funded by The Royal Society and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Council \n\nSummary:","236":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Several Western countries imposed sanctions on China this week. It is accused of committing serious human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang autonomous region. China denies this. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in the north-west region. In December the BBC published in an investigation based on new research showing China was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. How did Nike and H&M find themselves here? The statements in question were made by the companies last year, but only resurfaced in recent days following the announcement of Western sanctions. Both companies had said in separate statements that they were \"concerned\" about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region. But the latest furore appears to have been sparked by a recent social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Chinese Communist Party group. \"Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!\" it said on microblogging platform Weibo on Wednesday morning, as it shared screenshots of H&M's statement. State media outlets have since launched campaigns defending Xinjiang cotton and criticising the brands. Chinese state media CGTN shared a video on Weibo claiming to show the reality of cotton-picking in Xinjiang, which involved automation and quotes from a Uighur farmer saying that people \"fought\" to work there for high earnings. State broadcaster CCTV said that H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) - a multinational firm with the headquarters in Sweden - had \"miscalculated\" in trying to be a \"righteous hero\", and that it \"must pay a heavy price for its wrong actions\".

Rita Ora, who he recently collaborated with on the track Lonely Together, tweeted that she had \"no words\" after hearing the news. Diplo posted that Avicii's music will \"live forever\", writing that he \"set the precedent\" for other producers. Radio 1 presenter Annie Mac began her Friday evening show paying tribute to Avicii, saying it's a \"massive loss for dance music\" and that it was \"absolutely devastating news\". It's known that the 28-year-old has been suffering from pancreatitis, reportedly caused by heavy drinking. He once said in an interview: \"Drinking became routine for me, but it's impossible to keep up touring and drinking at the same time, because you are going to crash.\" The electronic dance music (EDM) star reportedly made $250,000 (\u00a3180,000) a night on tour. It was after Avicii's, real name Tim Bergling, 2011 hit Levels that he achieved worldwide acclaim. During his career he notched up 11 billion streams on Spotify and was the first EDM DJ to stage a worldwide arena tour, as nominated for two Grammy Awards and had nine UK top 10 singles, including two number ones. American musician Skrillex remixed that song and posted online that he was \"a genius and an innovator, yet sensitive and humble\". Other artists posting messages online include Martin Garrix, Liam Payne, Madonna, Dua Lipa, Calvin Harris and Deadmau5. In 2016 Avicii announced he was retiring from touring, after health complications, but it's thought it's something he didn't really enjoy.

However, those playing with touchscreens do develop their fine motor skills more quickly. Experts said the study was \"timely\" but parents should not lose sleep over it. There has been an explosion in touchscreens in the home, but understanding their impact on early childhood development has been lacking. The study by Birkbeck, University of London, questioned 715 parents of children under three years old. It asked how often their child played with a smartphone or tablet and about the child's sleep patterns. It showed that 75% of the toddlers used a touchscreen on a daily basis, with 51% of those between six and 11 months using one, and 92% of those between 25 and 36 months doing so as well. But children who did play with touchscreens slept less at night and more in the day. Overall they had around 15 minutes less sleep for every hour of touchscreen use. Not before bedtime? Dr Tim Smith, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"It isn't a massive amount when you're sleeping 10-12 hours a day in total, but every minute matters in young development because of the benefits of sleep.\" The study is not definitive, but Dr Smith says it \"seems to indicate touchscreens have some association with possible sleep problems\". However, his research has also shown toddlers who actively use touchscreens (swiping rather than watching) accelerate their development of motor skills. So should children be given touchscreens to play with? Dr Smith says: \"It's very tricky right now, the science is very immature, we are really lagging behind the technology and it's too early to make clear proclamations.\" He says the best bet is to follow similar rules for the amount of time spent in front of the TV. That means putting a limit on the total time spent on devices, ensuring children still do physica\n\nSummary:","239":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The children's mother had been in the shower at the time and was the person who alerted police. Nithiyakumar, 41, admitted two counts of manslaughter by diminished responsibility at the Old Bailey. Emergency services were called to the home in Aldborough Road North where they found both children injured. Pavinya was pronounced dead at the scene while Nigish was rushed to a hospital in Whitechapel where he later died. Nithiyakumar was also treated for knife wounds and when he was discharged from hospital he was charged with killing his children. The 41-year-old admitted to police he had killed his son and daughter, explaining that he had been depressed and customers had \"upset him\" while he was working in a shop. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC told the Old Bailey psychiatrists believed the defendant was \"suffering from a delusional disorder\" which had \"led him to kill his children\". \"It was one from which he had suffered for some time, for the best part of 10 years, with very little indication and very little treatment,\" he said. Mr Atkinson added that one expert thought it was \"remarkable he was able to function for as long as he did\" considering his condition. The court heard the defendant had no previous history of violence and prosecutors felt it was \"appropriate to accept the plea of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility\", Mr Atkinson said. Mrs Justice Cutts adjourned sentencing until 10 December, saying she would need \"further information from the doctors\". Nithiyakumar was sent back to the medium secure mental health centre in east London where he has been treated.

Lead archaeologist Tony Roberts said: \"The walls uncovered so far are some of the best preserved that I have witnessed in a number of years excavating.\" He said an \"older, hitherto unknown building\" could be beneath the ground. Mr Roberts said a geophysical survey indicated there were a lot more walls and rooms under the front lawn than just those of the old wing that housed the 18th Century stables.

Police later found other body parts further downriver and in his flat, identified as Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24. She had been living with him. He sobbed in court, saying: \"I repent\". Mr Sokolov was ordered into pre-trial custody for two months. In court he admitted shooting Ms Yeshchenko four times with a sawn-off shotgun, then chopping up the body with a saw and kitchen knife. A stun pistol was also found in the backpack. Divers are still searching for more remains: he is suspected of having dumped two more bags in the river. He sobbed so loudly in court that at one stage the judge adjourned proceedings. Mr Sokolov is a Napoleon expert who has received France's top state award, the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. He has written dozens of historical research papers, and Ms Yeshchenko, a postgraduate student, co-wrote some of them. He organised Napoleonic re-enactments - playing the role of Napoleon himself - and she participated. Mr Sokolov said the pair had been living together for five years, though other reports described it as a three-year relationship. The case has triggered outrage: women's rights activists say it illustrates widespread indifference towards sexual harassment and domestic violence in Russia. An online petition has collected more than 7,500 signatures, demanding that the managers of St Petersburg State University, where he lectured, be dismissed. It accuses them of having ignored previous students' complaints about Mr Sokolov. In court he alleged that Ms Yeshchenko had attacked him with a knife - and at that point he shot her - during a blazing row. \"This girl, who seemed like a beautiful ideal to me, turned into a monster,\" he alleged.

In June, VW agreed a \u20ac1bn settlement in Germany over the emissions scandal, which came to light in 2015. Audi, whose ex-boss Rupert Stadler is being investigated over \"dieselgate\", said affected cars spanned 2004-18. Audi said in a statement that some V6 and V8 diesel engines were \"placed on the market with an impermissible software function\". Other engines implicated include the widely-used EA 288 and EA 189. In 2015, US investigators discovered that some VW diesel cars were fitted with what became known as \"defeat devices\" to flatter emissions readings during engine tests so that the true output of nitrogen oxides was reduced. The scandal spread throughout the motor industry, engulfing not just VW and its other car brands, but to other motor manufacturers. VW admitted in 2015 to putting defeat device software into 11 million cars worldwide. The company's total costs in fines, buybacks and refits has now reached \u20ac27bn. While the probe against Audi is now closed, other cases against executives from the VW group - including former chief executive Martin Winterkorn - remain open, with charges including fraud, false advertising and failure to keep investors informed. Earlier this month, VW ousted Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler. In June, he was put under investigation by German prosecutors over alleged fraud and false advertising involving the sale of cars with defeat devices, and remains in police custody. Audi's fine of \u20ac800m consists of \u20ac5m for regulatory rule-breaking, with the rest being payment for the economic benefits resulting from the sale of cars with defeat devices.

The party has in the past warned its officials to refrain from extravagant dinners and purchasing moon cakes using public funds. China has been conducting a strict anti-corruption drive since 2012. The new rule on golf states that members are banned from \"obtaining, holding or using membership cards for gyms, clubs, golf clubs, or various other types of consumer cards, or entering private clubs\". If caught, members could either receive a warning or be removed from the party, depending on the severity of the violation. 'Social interaction' The new regulations (in Chinese) did not explain why the joining of golf clubs is banned, but such clubs are often seen by the Chinese public as places where officials have cut shady deals. In September, local media reported that at least 60 employees in state-owned companies were punished for spending public funds on playing golf. Earlier this month, Lin Chunsong, a vice-mayor in the south-eastern Fujian province, was sacked for belonging to a golf club and playing golf while he should have been at work. China and golf One owner of a golf equipment store in Shanghai, who was only identified by his surname, Huang, told Reuters that his store's sales had dropped at least 30% last year. Golf in China was \"about the social interaction\", he said. \"If a company boss can't play with a government official, there's little point in him spending his money.\" Another new rule states that party members cannot \"violate official provisions on hospitality management and engage in over-the-top entertaining, or take advantage of opportunities for extravagant eating and drinking\".

Others, including Waitrose, Tesco and Asda, have also branched out into selling misshapen fresh items. Shops have been criticised for being too fussy, causing farmers to throw away perfectly edible fruit and veg. But if customers will only accept blemish-free produce, there's little point in a supermarket putting it on the shelf only to throw it away unsold later. That's one reason why retailers are giving such goods clear labelling and other promotional pushes. Bruised Sainsbury says it is trying to half the amount of food the average family throws away each year from its current \u00a3700. This week it is turning its attention to the banana, with pop-up \"banana rescue\" stations in about 500 stores to encourage consumers to use fruit that is overripe or past its best. The Government's food waste awareness service, Wrap, found that 1.4 million bananas are thrown out every day for having minor bruises or black marks on their skin, which it says add up to \u00a380m in waste a year. Sainsbury's suggestions include using them to make banana bread or muffins. For those without the time to bake, Sainsbury reminds us that bananas can be blended into smoothies, and even chopped up to be added into fruit salads. Paul Crewe, Sainsbury's head of sustainability and environment, said: \"Sixty one per cent of Britons admit they never use otherwise discarded bananas in baking, so we want to inspire customers to use their fruit in different ways.

Cancer Research UK has launched a new tool that allows people to compare cancer statistics in their area with those in the rest of the country. It hopes the local data will help doctors and politicians tackle the specific problems in their patch. There is separate data for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the greater Glasgow area had the highest cancer mortality while Shetland had the lowest. Mortality was much higher in Belfast than the rest of Northern Ireland. Merthyr Tydfil was one of the worst performing parts of Wales, while Ceredigion had better cancer survival rates. Harrow, Richmond and Surrey in the south of England performed better than areas further north such as Stoke, Hartlepool and Nottingham. Smoking A significant factor in the regional variation is differences in lifestyle, such as smoking, which is linked to lung cancer. Kensington and Chelsea, East Sussex and Devon all had fewer than 35 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 people. The rate is more than double - in excess of 85 per 100,000, in cities such as Hull, Manchester and Liverpool. A similar website presented by Public Health England led Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to describe the differences in England as \"shocking\". Charlotte Williams, the executive director of London Cancer, said: \"[The tool] means it's easier to identify where we're doing well, and where we could do better, and how we could potentially learn from others. \"This will pinpoint where we need to improve to help ensure everyone gets the best care possible.\" Sara Hiom, director of patient engagement and early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said: \"In the UK we are privileged to have access to valuable information about cancer diagnosis and treatments for different parts of the country. \"We've created this website because we hope that it will allow policymakers and healthcare professionals to understand what's going on in their area \n\nSummary:","247":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Three people were jailed but allegations of official negligence or state collusion were rejected. Dink's actual killer, Ogun Samast, was jailed earlier for 22 years. The journalist, shot dead outside the Istanbul offices of Turkish-Armenian newspaper Agos, had angered Turkish nationalists by describing the mass killing of Armenians a century ago as genocide. On Tuesday, a judge sentenced one man to life imprisonment for incitement to murder Dink, and two others were given 12 years in prison. However, all three men, along with 16 other defendants, were acquitted of the charge of being members of a criminal organisation. The prosecutor, Hikmet Usta, said he would appeal against Judge Rustem Eryilmaz's decision, and insisted there was sufficient evidence to establish the murder had been an \"organised crime\". Turkish President Abdullah Gul defended the verdicts of the court on Thursday, saying \"The conclusion of this case in a transparent and just manner in line with our laws is an important test for us.\" 'We are all Armenian' On Thursday, human rights activists placed red carnations on the spot where Dink was shot dead by Samast in broad daylight, outside the offices of Agos.

'Physical abuse' Ms Coffey said some children were being sent as far as 100 miles from where they live \"where they have no friends or family circles or local social workers\", creating a \"perfect storm where it is increasingly difficult to protect [them]\". \"Despite the [government] pledge, record numbers of children are being sent away to places where they are more vulnerable to exploitation,\" she added. \"These children are running away at a faster rate and are being targeted and preyed upon by paedophiles and criminals who know they are vulnerable.\" The MP said there had also been a huge increase in the number of sent-away children going missing, with the number of incidents more than doubling to almost 10,000 a year.

But Polat Can insisted the SDF played an important part in the raid in a Twitter thread posted on Monday. \"All intelligence and access to al-Baghdadi as well as the identification of his place were the result of our own work. Our intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute,\" he said. Mr Can added that the SDF had been working with the CIA to track Baghdadi since 15 May, and had discovered that he was hiding in Idlib province, where the raid took place. The source, said Mr Can, had found out that the IS leader was about to move to a new location in Jarablus. The SDF have been key allies of the US in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group, but earlier this month Mr Trump pulled American troops out of northern Syria. Analysts say the US withdrawal in effect gave Turkey the green light to begin a cross-border assault on the region. What do we know about the raid? Several US allies or powers in the region were given advance notification of the raid, including Turkey, Iraq, Kurdish forces in north-eastern Syria, and Russia, which controls airspace over Idlib. The troops arrived to a barrage of shots from the ground, reports said. On landing, the US force called on Baghdadi, who had fled into a tunnel, to come out and surrender. The force blew holes in the walls to avoid any booby traps in doors. The retreating Baghdadi then detonated his suicide vest, killing himself and three children in the tunnel. Mr Trump said test\n\nSummary:","254":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Mr McCann, 57, denies six counts of indecent assault between 1987 and 1990. He said the child's mother saw him \"as a genuinely nice person\". Mr McCann, of Great Sutton, Cheshire, is accused of grooming the boy to sexually abuse him, Chester Crown Court heard. The defendant worked as a part-time youth coach for the under-16s team and is accused of regularly abusing the boy, first on a skiing trip, then at his home in Crewe and after games at a local squash club. Mr McCann told detectives the family were \"on their uppers\" and had fallen on \"hard times\", so he agreed to take the child on a skiing holiday with the agreement of his mother. He said: \"She saw me as somebody, as a genuinely nice person to help out.\" Police asked if it was \"normal\" that a man, then in his mid 20s, should go on holiday with a 15-year-old boy alone, six months after meeting him. Mr McCann replied: \"It was innocent. It never crossed my mind. I was like a friend of the family. I took a bit of pity, they looked like they needed help.\" He told police no sexual activity took place. Mr McCann said while the boy was \"not a shrinking violet\", he was not good enough for the youth team and was only used as a substitute. He told police: \"I did not hold his career in my hand or anything.\" The trial continues.\n\nSummary:","255":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But after a government U-turn students grades will now be estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm. The Orwell Youth Prize winner said she was \"relieved\" to get into St Andrews. \"I have now got three A* and an A in English Literature and I have been offered a place at St Andrews. 'Delighted for Jessica' \"I'm so excited, happy and relieved,\" the student from Ashton Sixth Form College in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester said. Ivar M\u00f8ller, the University of St Andrews director of UK and EU admissions, said: \"We are delighted for Jessica and look forward to welcoming her and all our new students into the St Andrews family in a few weeks' time.\" Exams were cancelled this year because of the pandemic and about 40% of A-level results were downgraded by exams regulator Ofqual. Ofqual calculated results using a formula in which the biggest determining factor was the school's performances in each subject in the previous three years. On Monday, following an outcry, the government decided to use teachers' estimates. Ms Johnson said the B grade awarded to her in English Literature on Thursday had resulted in her losing her place to read at the Scottish university with a scholarship.

The park authority's criticisms followed news that another ancient stone, Bedd Morris near Newport, was recently toppled after being hit by a vehicle. But park rangers also claim there has been an increase in the dumping of hazardous waste, including asbestos, and off-roading remains a problem. Park authority spokesman, Phil Bennett, said: \"The distinctive arrangement of prehistoric stones at Bedd Arthur stands within the Preseli Hills, which is also a Special Area of Conservation and it's very unfortunate that they have been defaced.\" \"The stone at Bedd Arthur had names scratched into it, whilst the 6ft plus Bedd Morris standing stone was hit by a vehicle and knocked over.\" Ranger Richard Vaughan added: \"A car was driven up an old trackway below the Iron Age fort of Carn Ffoi on Carn Ingli mountain and abandoned. \"The sump broke and a 200m black slick of oil contaminated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. \"The black BMW was a left on a bridleway, and is popular access route for locals and visitors alike. \"I've also had to clean up a popular parking site on Dinas mountain covered in empty bottles and smashed glass on the surrounding rocky area.\" A Cadw spokesperson said: \"Scheduled ancient monuments are legally protected, and damaging them is a criminal activity. \"These prehistoric sites have been here for thousands of years. \"Cadw will be working with the National Park Authority and site owners to make good the damage as much as possible, although damage to historic sites is in most cases, irreversible.\"\n\nSummary:","258":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The hubbub around the door and signs in the window handwritten in Arabic script indicate that arrivals from the Middle East are still coming to Serbia's capital. Inside, there is organised chaos. On the ground floor, young men lounge awkwardly in hard-backed chairs, waiting for their turn on the computers lined up on one side of the room. Those in front of the machines don headsets and hold ebullient Skype conversations. Upstairs, the atmosphere is completely different. Bewildered-looking families gather in a stuffy \"safe space\" operated by Save The Children. Parents usher their children over to a pile of toys, while a small boy cries inconsolably. The distinctive aroma of the refugee trail - damp, unwashed clothes - begins to fill the room. \"They are Yazidi people from Iraq,\" says Marjan, a translator struggling to find a common language with the new arrivals. There are more than two dozen people in this extended family group. They did not follow the classic route to Serbia via Greece and Macedonia, but came over the country's eastern border with Bulgaria.

But a separatist militia commander said it was still in control of most areas. The fighting has exposed a rift within the Saudi-led coalition supporting the government in Yemen's civil war. Saudi Arabia backs President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, while the United Arab Emirates backs the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which accuses Mr Hadi's cabinet of mismanagement and is critical of his ties to Islamists. For the past three years, the two sides have been part of an uneasy alliance against the rebel Houthi movement, which controls much of north-western Yemen. The civil war has triggered the world's worst humanitarian disaster, with 80% of the population - more than 24 million people - requiring humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. Aden has served as the government's temporary capital since 2015, when President Hadi and his cabinet were forced to flee Sanaa by the Houthis. Almost three weeks ago, after a separatist leader was killed in a Houthi attack, the STC-aligned Security Belt militia - which is armed and funded by the UAE - seized control of Aden from Saudi-backed forces after three days of fighting that left dozens of people dead. The separatists also overran cities and towns elsewhere in the south, including Ataq, the capital of Shabwa province, and Zinjibar, the capital of Abyan province. The STC demanded that Mr Hadi's cabinet be replaced, but the government said it would not negotiate until the separatist fighters withdrew from military installations and returned to their previous positions. It accused the UAE of responsibility for the \"armed rebellion\" - an allegation that officials in Abu Dhabi denied. On Monday, two days after pro-government forces retook Ataq, the UAE and Saudi Arabia issued a joint statement calling for a ceasefire i\n\nSummary:","261":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

His victims were made to work 90-hour weeks in squalid conditions in exchange for accommodation, leftover takeaway food and alcohol. Newcastle Crown Court ordered Bariana to repay the proceeds of his crime. Northumbria Police said assets worth \u00a3133,000, including two houses and a large amount of cash, had been seized. The remaining \u00a3142,000 will still have to be paid off, the force said. A spokesman said Bariana's victims, who were all white British men, were made to clean sewage pipes by hand and work 13-hour days in bare feet. The court previously heard they also had to work for free in his takeaway restaurant. Bariana, of Blue House Farm, Netherton, Bedlington, took all their housing benefit as payment. If the victims refused he would then resort to violence and intimidation, the force said. He was found guilty of six offences of requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour relating to four men between 2010 and 2016. Insp Billy Mulligan said: \"Hargit Bariana preyed on vulnerable victims for his own gain and their consistent bravery and strength during this whole process has been inspiring. \"Hopefully his victims can find comfort knowing that Bariana is not only behind bars but has now had these assets taken off him.

As BBC South America business correspondent Daniel Gallas wrote at the time, Mr Temer, had \"always been a kingmaker, but never king\". In a series of carefully plotted moves, Mr Temer clearly positioned himself as a rival president. Ms Rousseff accused him of orchestrating a coup against her. Daniel Gallas described him as \"a skilled politician intent on ending the Rousseff presidency and beginning a new era in Brazil\". Although the Brazilian public did not hit the streets to protest against Mr Temer, his approval ratings stayed in single figures. Political scientist Carlos Melo described society as \"disenchanted and demobilised\" during the Temer tenure. In the October 2018 election, he was replaced by the far-right Jair Bolsonaro. Bribery allegations Mr Temer was the first president in Brazilian history to have charges brought against him while still holding on to the top job. He was accused of being the head of a criminal organisation and of trying to obstruct the course of justice. Prosecutors said that back in 2006, when he was still a congressman, he created a bribery scheme that was still alive and well when he became president. His political group allegedly funnelled over 587m reais ($180m, \u00a3137m) from state-run institutions such as Petrobras and the Brazilian Lottery into the pockets of lawmakers. He was also accused of pressuring billionaire businessman Joesley Batista into buying the silence of two key witnesses that were co-operating with investigators from jail.

In April, the competition watchdog blocked its merger with Sainsbury's. Since the Competition and Markets Authority halted that deal, Asda's parent company, Walmart, has said the supermarket business could eventually be listed on the stock market. The figures are for like-for-like sales, which strip out changes to stores, and showed a 0.5% rise in the second quarter, when the late timing of Easter gave sales a boost. That came after sales had fallen 1.1% in the previous quarter. Mr Burnley said: \"If ever a case study on the impact the mood of the nation has on UK spending habits were needed, this quarter has provided it.\" He added: \"Consumer confidence levels are at an almost six-year low - due in no small part to the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit and amplified by the impact of weather and tracking against national sporting events in the same period last year. \"As a result, our non-food business has been challenged during the period.

He has defended other prominent lawyers, including Chen Guangcheng and Gao Zhisheng, as well as practitioners of the banned Falun Gong movement. A representative of campaign group Amnesty International questioned the validity of the allegations against Li. The lawyer was detained in 2015 as part of a wider government crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping. His trial took place on Tuesday in the Tianjin City Number Two Intermediate People's Court and concerned state secrets, the court said on its Weibo social media account. 'Smear and attack' In its ruling, the court said that since 2008 Li had used social media and foreign media to \"smear and attack state organs and the legal system\". It also said he had used foreign funds to \"interfere in high-profile cases\" and colluded with several people \"harbouring subversive ideas\", including lawyers and those \"involved in illegal religious activities\". His jail sentence had been suspended for four years and he would be denied his political privileges, the court said. The suspension means Li could be released imminently, although it is unclear whether he has been. His time spent in detention should also count towards his jail sentence.

They claim the decision not to detain him under the Mental Health Act and to withdraw continuous observation in prison contributed to his death. The Ministry of Justice said the welfare of inmates was a top priority. Mr Saunders' mother Donna said the way the prison service handled her son's case was \"absolutely appalling\". His father, Mark, said his son \"should never have gone to the prison in the first place\". Mr Saunders was arrested in December on suspicion of attempted murder after his father and brother were stabbed when they tried to stop him cutting his throat. When he was taken to a police station, he again told a doctor he was going to kill himself. But two psychiatrists he saw later were not made aware of his previous suicide attempt. They were unable to make a referral for detention under the provisions of the Mental Health Act as Mr Saunders stated he was too tired to participate in an assessment. This finding was disclosed in a report by The South Essex Partnership University NHS Trust (SEPT) which revealed he was suffering from severe paranoia when he told his girlfriend people were trying to harm him. An initial assessment by SEPT staff decided he posed a risk of harming himself or others. Mr Saunders' parents said when he was taken to Chelmsford Prison they made repeated attempts to alert staff to their son's intention to kill himself. Mrs Saunders said she pleaded with staff to keep him on constant watch instead of switching to half-hourly observations. Her son electrocuted himself in his cell on 4 January and his death is now subject to a report by the Prison and Probation Ombudsman.

The parish council believes neglect and the cold weather caused the collapse. In 2007 South Norfolk Council was asked to compulsorily purchase the building and pass it to the parish council for repair and custodianship. It was on an at-risk register, but no record of who owned it could be found so that repairs could be made. Vandals had damaged the structure and some of the brickwork was decaying. But the recent cold weather was the last straw and the roof fell inwards over the new year, causing the entire structure to collapse.\n\nSummary:","273":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Police used tear gas to disperse a crowd of about 200 parents protesting outside the school, reports said. Kenya passed a law in 2017 to provide free sanitary towels for schoolgirls. However, a parliamentary committee is currently investigating why the programme is yet to be rolled out across all schools. The girl's mother said a teacher had called her \"dirty\" for soiling her uniform and ordered her to leave the class in Kabiangek, west of the capital Nairobi, last Friday. \"She had nothing to use as a pad. When the blood stained her clothes, she was told to leave the classroom and stand outside,\" the mother was quoted as saying in Kenyan media. She said her daughter came home and told her mother what had happened, but then when she went to fetch water she took her own life. Her parents reported the matter to the police but became frustrated by an apparent lack of action, the Daily Nation reported. Together with other parents they staged a protest outside the school on Tuesday. Police moved in and made five arrests when the demonstrators blocked a road and pulled down the school gate, reports said. The school has since been closed. Regional police chief Alex Shikondi said the circumstances of the girl's death were being investigated. The school's headteacher has declined to comment. In Kenya, as in other countries, many girls cannot afford sanitary products such as pads and tampons. A UN report in 2014 said that one in 10 girls in sub-Saharan Africa missed school during their period. Some girls reportedly lose 20% of their education for this reason, making them more likely to drop out of school altogether, the report said.\n\nSummary:","274":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It will also give legal backing to bulk collection of internet traffic. The Home Office was forced to revise the draft bill after concerns by three committees of MPs it did not do enough to protect privacy and was too vague. Home Secretary Theresa May said the revised bill, published on Tuesday, reflected many of these concerns, and was \"both clearer and stronger in protecting privacy\". For Labour, shadow home secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the stronger safeguards but said the party \"will not be rushed\" into reaching a judgement on the bill as \"it has major implications for privacy and how we are governed and policed\". He said areas of potential disagreement concerned \"the most intrusive powers\" and \"the widening of access to Internet Connection Records\". 'Draconian' The bill expands the purposes for which police can obtain internet connection records, which are details of the websites and online applications people use. It says they can be acquired for a \"specific investigation\" provided it is \"necessary and proportionate\". This clause was not contained in the draft legislation. Police will also get the power to hack into computers and smart phones - so called \"equipment interference\" - normally reserved for the security services, when there is a \"threat to life\" situation, such as locating a missing child. This is an extension of police powers in the draft legislation. Ministers say the new powers are needed to fight terrorism, but internet firms have questioned their practicality - and civil liberties campaigners say it clears the way for mass surveillance of UK citizens. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said: \"On first reading, the revised Bill barely pays lip service to the concerns raised by the committees that scrutinised the draft Bill. \"If passed, it would mean that the UK has one of the most draconian surveillance laws of any democr\n\nSummary:","275":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But football fans who have official tickets for the match won't need to get one. Instead they will be issued with a Fan ID which takes 72 hours to process and should be carried at all times. The Fan ID will expire on 25 July. Visitors will not be able to leave Russia if their Fan ID or visa has expired and they could be made to pay a fine, attend court and be banned from returning to the country. What else will they need? A passport which has been signed and has more than six months to run is an absolute necessity. This will also be needed to get into matches. Health insurance is also a big one, as the European Health Insurance Card doesn't apply in Russia. Travellers will also need to fill in a migration card upon arrival, half of which is kept by the authorities and the other half to be kept by the visitor and returned to customs officials when leaving Russia. How safe will it be? Political tensions with Russia have escalated in recent months with the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, which the UK government has blamed on the Russian authorities. The Foreign Office said visitors \"should be aware of the possibility of anti-British sentiment or harassment\" and is advising them to be vigilant, avoid protests or demonstrations and not to comment publicly on political developments.

It described them as not \"dissuasive and proportionate\" based on the size of the island's finance sector. Higher penalties for licensees will be limited to 10% of annual turnover. The fines can be levied for failing to carry out checks on customers, not carrying out regular risk reviews and failing to make the disclosures necessary under Guernsey law. Proposed financial penalties The proposals compare to fines of 5,000,000 euro or 10% of the total annual turnover of a credit institution or financial institution across the European Union. In Jersey there are three levels of fines with the highest being 8% of relevant income up to a maximum of \u00a34m. The Policy Council, which has brought forward the proposals, said the Guernsey Financial Services Commission and Guernsey International Business Association have been involved in the development of and support the changes. The council's report said: \"It is clearly important to be able to strike the right balance between ensuring that, on the one hand the Bailiwick's regulatory regime is underpinned by an effective and proportionate approach to enforcement, and on the other hand that firms are able to obtain the services of good quality people as directors and other officers.\" The proposals do not address the other main criticism of the Moneyval report - that the number of investigations, prosecutions and convictions for money laundering in the Bailiwick are \"disproportionately low\" compared to other jurisdictions.

The busiest included Islay during the isle's whisky festival, Sumburgh because of oil-related work and Stornoway due to school building work. Dundee, however, reported a 11.3% fall in passengers. Hial said this was because of reduced capacity on the airport's London City route, and a decline in passengers on its Belfast and Birmingham routes. The operator said the fall in passenger numbers had been offset slightly by the earlier start this year of Dundee's Jersey charter route. Growing demand Inverness was the busiest airport in the group, reporting an 8.4% rise - 55,519 passengers. Numbers were boosted by the continuing success of the city's service to Amsterdam in Holland and additional Gatwick flights, Hial said. Seasonal flights to D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany and Zurich in Switzerland also started last month and were expected to increase international traffic through the summer. Inglis Lyon, managing director for HIAL, said Sumburgh on Shetland had also benefited from international travellers thanks to its link with Bergen, in Norway.

Another note described how young Prince William \"swamped\" his baby brother with \"an endless supply of hugs and kisses\". The letters form part of about 40 lots from Mr Dickman's former estate, which sold for \u00a355,000 in total - exceeding the estimate price of \u00a313,000. Cheffins, a Cambridgeshire auction house, said the lots were \"a unique collection of royal memorabilia\". Bidders from as far away as Australia, Japan and the US were trying to purchase the items. In a letter on headed Kensington Palace paper dated 20 September 1984, Diana thanked Mr Dickman for \"such a lovely card\" following the birth of her youngest son, Harry. She wrote: \"William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near!\" \"The reaction to one tiny person's birth has totally overwhelmed us and I can hardly breathe for the mass of flowers that are arriving here!\" That letter sold for \u00a33,200, having had an estimated auction price of \u00a3400-600. In another, dated 17 October 1992, Diana says how both young princes \"are well and enjoying boarding school a lot, although Harry is constantly in trouble!\".

At a special council meeting on Tuesday, councillors decided that their employment would end immediately. \"It draws to a close a most difficult period,\" the council said afterwards. The former chief executive Anthony O'Sullivan is also on \"special leave\". Mr Barnett will receive \u00a3171,000 and Mr Perkins \u00a3127,000 as \"compensation for the loss of their employment and on condition that this brings matters to a close\". In both cases, the council said the settlements were \"considered to be much less than would have been the cost of continuing with a disciplinary investigation\" which would have taken a further 12 months. It was claimed in September 2012 that the three officers agreed to give themselves 20% pay rises when most council staff faced pay freezes. The pay rises were later changed to smaller increases. A police probe into the affair led to a criminal case which was dropped in 2015. An internal investigation has been ongoing but councillors were asked to approve settlement deals for Mr Barnett and Mr Perkins on Tuesday. Leader of the Plaid Cymru group on the council, Colin Mann, said many local people would be \"naturally concerned and upset\" that a financial settlement was being put forward. Several councillors said there was broad support during the closed-doors meeting for amending the current legislation surrounding disciplinary matters to ensure similar delays do not happen again.

Voters would not be able to trigger the process, the committee noted. Deputy PM Nick Clegg has previously argued that the right to trigger a by-election should not be \"unqualified\". Under current rules, if an MP receives a prison sentence of more than 12 months, they automatically lose their seat. The government proposes that, in future, if an MP receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or less, their constituents will be petitioned - and if 10% support the idea there will be a by-election. A petition would also be triggered if MPs in the House of Commons decided that one of its members was guilty of \"serious wrongdoing\". But under government plans it is not possible for an MP's constituents to instigate the \"recall\" process to force a by-election. 'Cut of the jib' The planned conditions were too \"narrow\", the committee declared. \"It is vital that there is public confidence in the political process,\" Labour MP and committee chairman Graham Allen said. \"But the restricted form of recall proposed by the government risks creating the illusion that people will have a say in recalling their elected representative while ensuring that this will probably never happen in practice. \"There is a real danger that this could alienate people still further.\" Testifying before the committee in April, Mr Clegg said the plans were not intended to give voters \"an unlimited, unqualified, untrammelled right to trigger a by-election, whenever you happen to feel like it, because you don't like the cut of the jib of your local MP\". He said he was open to suggestion from his fellow MPs as to what should constitute \"serious wrongdoing\".

She worked hard to get through high school and win a scholarship to the University of Akron, in Ohio. Seven days into her new life away from home, she spent the evening watching YouTube videos with two fellow students. When she returned to her room, they followed. One of the men left. The other refused to go, and assaulted her. \"My life in college was completely destroyed,\" she says. Julia's story is an all-too-common one on American university campuses. President Barack Obama last month set up a task force to tackle college sexual assaults. Many survivors say the universities themselves are failing to deal with the issue. Obama said the situation was \"totally unacceptable\" and last month launched a task force to tackle the issue. The president also called on university officials to examine their reporting and support systems. \"Are we doing everything that we should be doing?\" he asked. His words rang true for many survivors of college sexual assault, who argue that the universities have brushed the issue under the carpet for too long. When Julia tried to pursue the case through the university's disciplinary process, she says she was told she'd have to face her assailant at an internal hearing. \"Three days after he raped me I wasn't in any sort of emotional state to be in the vicinity of him, let alone have a conversation with him about what he did,\" she says. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Her grades slipped, resulting in her losing her scholarship. \"It felt like they didn't really know how to handle it and didn't care to try,\" she says of the university.

A study, published on the BMJ website, argued that antipsychotics should not be used \"in the absence of clear need\". Experts said better alternatives were needed to antipsychotics. A study in 2009, suggested 180,000 people with dementia were taking antipsychotic medication in the UK and said the drugs resulted in 1,800 additional deaths. Data differences Researchers at Harvard Medical School followed 75,445 people in nursing homes who had dementia and were prescribed antipsychotics. The researchers said some drugs were associated with more than twice the risk of death than risperidone, another antipsychotic which was used as a benchmark to compare the other drugs. The study concluded: \"The data suggest that the risk of mortality with these drugs is generally increased with higher doses and seems to be highest for haloperidol and least for quetiapine.\" However, the way the study was conducted meant it could not say definitively that certain drugs actually caused more deaths, merely that there was a link between the two. The Department of Health said antipsychotic use was \"resulting in as many as 1,800 unnecessary deaths per year. This is simply unacceptable.\" \"That's why reducing the level of antipsychotics prescribing for people with dementia by two-thirds is one the key priorities in the National Dementia Strategy.\" The Dementia Action Alliance - which includes the Alzheimer's Society, Age UK and the Department of Health - has called for all prescriptions for antipsychotics to be reviewed by the end of March 2012.

There are a number of different assistance dog charities and organisations ranging from the large such as Guide Dogs who currently have 4,700 dogs to the small like Medical Detection Dogs who have 50 dogs that detect sugar level fluctuations in people with diabetes. The training of dogs takes a long time and is often very involved. Puppies sometimes start training at six to eight weeks old as they begin to familiarise themselves with their surroundings and learn commands. All accredited assistance dogs pass the same initial test - a public access test. They also undergo task training which is specific to the disability of the person they will be assisting. Assistance dogs can have \"career changes\". When training at Guide Dogs for example, a dog who displays acute smell may be recommended to become a medical detection dog, or sometimes they have excellent credentials as both a guide dog and a seizure alert dog giving them the potential to help somebody with both needs - a blind person with epilepsy for example. Dogs which help people with anxiety and other mental health problems are beginning to emerge in the UK, though are more popular in the US. Presently these dogs are not covered by either the Equality Act or recognised by Assistance Dogs UK which oversees seven accredited assistance dog charities and organisations although and campaigners are hopeful this will change. Assistance dog owners have equal rights laid down by the Equality Act 2010. With a dog they have rights to public services supplied by banks, shops, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants.

After she scratched his face, Devlin washed her hands and cut her nails to destroy DNA evidence, but did not take the clippings away and was traced. Devlin admitted two charges of robbery and one count of grievous bodily harm and was jailed for 22 years. Leicester Crown Court heard Devlin, of no fixed address, was on the run after absconding from HMP Sudbury when the robbery took place in March. He grabbed the woman, who is in her 60s, and demanded cash and gold, along with two other men who have not been traced. Leicestershire Police said Devlin started punching the woman's face but when she grabbed his balaclava she scratched his face. 'Truly shocking' The woman's hands and face were then sprayed with a cleaning fluid and he cut her fingernails using nail clippers. Despite these precautions, Devlin left the clippings behind and when they were analysed the DNA was matched to him. The victim suffered injuries including a fractured left wrist which required surgery, bruising to her face and damage to her eye. The same night Devlin and two accomplices broke into another house and threatened a woman and her two children, stealing a quantity of jewellery. Leicestershire Police described the attacks as \"truly shocking\". Devlin also admitted absconding from lawful custody, two counts of aggravated burglary and one count of handling stolen goods.

Its use has been accepted by the Scottish Medicines Consortium. Scotland is the first part of the UK to approve Avastin for routine use on the NHS. It was previously approved by the SMC as a treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. The SMC said: \"Bevacizumab (Avastin) can give patients an extra 3-4 months survival time that is very important in the context of their limited remaining months. \"As no new medicines for this condition have been licensed in the last ten years, bevacizumab was considered to represent a significant breakthrough in treatment.\" A total of 309 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in Scotland in 2013, with 88 losing their life to it in 2014. Prof Nick Reed, consultant clinical oncologist at the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow, said: \"Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. \"The prognosis for advanced disease or recurrent disease is poor and the symptoms are often uncomfortable and distressing for patients who have to stay in hospital for prolonged periods of time. \"This is a much awaited decision in Scotland - there have been no new medicines licensed for over 10 years and the only available treatment has been chemotherapy. \"Avastin is added to chemotherapy and delays the progression of complications and prolongs life by approximately four months.\" He added: \"For any mother, daughter or wife, this is an important amount of time as it allows them to continue to work, be more independent and plan for their family's future.\" 'Constant pain' The SMC also approved a new treatment for patients with severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a painful long-term skin condition which can leave sufferers covered with abscesses.

As Mr Salmond moves to hand over the reins to Nicola Sturgeon and steps down from the top job at Holyrood, here's a look at how events panned out. Sands o' life The day started out, as you do, with the unveiling of a standing stone in Edinburgh. The text immortalised Mr Salmond's pledge on education, paraphrased from the Robert Burns poem A Red, Red Rose. The first minister said the rocks would \"melt with the sun\" before he would allow tuition fees to be set in Scotland. In the bag Mr Salmond then chaired his final cabinet meeting, at Bute House in Edinburgh, side-by-side with first minister in waiting Ms Sturgeon. Before making his statement to MSPs at Holyrood, Mr Salmond had joked that he was looking forward to getting better at golf. It's reported his cabinet colleagues supported his aspirations with a leaving present of a golf bag. Chamber swan song Then to and in his final first ministerial statement, Mr Salmond called the office the privilege of his life. The first minister said the new sense of political confidence and engagement in Scotland was the point at which he wished to depart the post. Although he did not commit to totally bowing out from politics. But he did finish with the prediction: \"More change and better days lie ahead for this parliament and for Scotland.\" For Scottish Labour, Jackie Baillie said that whatever the future held for Mr Salmond, his place in history had already been assured, while Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson described him as a \"political Lazarus\". The Lib Dems' Willie Rennie said the first minister's lasting legacy would be almost securing independence in the \"biggest democratic experience of all our lifetimes\", but with \"wounds\" left still to heal.

The doctor said prescriptions dispensed by the remote surgery would be handed over via a window. He also advised that medication should be left in the car for several hours before opening. Patients were informed via social media that the surgery was closed to all patients on Friday afternoon. When asked to explain the decision, Dr Coull posted: \"Strachur has very specific circumstances. We are the only health care providers in a remote area servicing a very elderly population, so we are at the extreme end of the scale of risk to patients if we have a patient turn up in the practice with Covid-19 as they would have nowhere else to go.\" He said that by telephone triaging all patients before allowing them into the building, the medical team could minimise the risk to patients, keep the waiting room mostly empty and be able to clean the areas between patients. Dr Coull told BBC news: \"We have a very high age population, we are in the 96th percentile for age and we also have a very high level of chronic diseases. \"It's quite an older village and we are the only practice in the village so if anything happened to us there would be no other services. The nearest people would be half an hour away.\" Dr Coull said that the biggest threat to the practice would be if a suspected case walked into the surgery and led to its closure while it was investigated. He added: \"We have decided to increase telephone and video consultations. We are going to have the doors locked initially and only bring people in by invitation, spread out the appointments over a period of time and clean the room between patients. Explaining his advice on dispensing, he said medical staff were at high risk of infection themselves and could inadvertently spread the disease when handing out medication.

The royal couple then went on visit Waltham Forest and Harrow. Tory leader of Redbridge Council Keith Prince said the Queen's visit was a \"great privilege and honour\". When the royal couple first arrived, they were greeted with a huge cheer and the Queen and duke walked along a path to the mansion stopping briefly to meet some of the well-wishers. Some of the residents welcomed the Queen by decorating their houses with large flags and bunting, hung from rooftops. 'Good humour' Philip showed that despite his recent health problems he had lost none of his blunt sense of humour when he joked with a disabled man about his mode of transport. He walked up to David Miller, 60, and gesturing to the four-wheeled mobility scooter he was sitting on, he asked \"how many people have you knocked over this morning on that thing?\". Mr Miller, a trustee of a charitable trust that runs the Valentine mansion, has difficulties walking, due to a spinal problem. He said later: \"That is just typical from the duke. He is renowned for his humour but no offence was taken, it was all in good humour. \"I told him 'no, your Royal Highness' - I had not knocked anyone down.\" At the 17th Century house, they viewed paintings by artists including Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and David Hockney. As the Queen left the building, she came across artist Jason Rose painting a portrait of his teenage son in the lobby. She asked his son if he had a day off school and when he said he did, she asked: \"Why are you wearing your school uniform?\" The 14-year-old made her laugh when he said: \"I managed to get the day off because I told them I would wear my uniform.\" Catering courses Before leaving, the Queen opened Valentines Diamond Jubilee Dry Garden - laid with plants that need little watering - surrounded by cheering crowds.

It works by getting into cancer cells, killing them from the inside, and also boosting the patient's immune system. Further trials are planned for later in the year. Head and neck cancer, which includes cancer of the mouth, tongue and throat, affects up to 8,000 people every year in the UK. Study leader Dr Kevin Harrington, who is based at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said current treatments were effective if the cancer was picked up early but that many patients were not diagnosed until it was more advanced. The herpes virus, which is also being tested in patients with skin cancer, is genetically manipulated so that it grows inside tumour cells but cannot infect normal healthy cells. Once there it has a triple effect - it multiplies, killing tumour cells as it does so, it is engineered to produce a human protein that activates the immune system and it also makes a viral protein that acts as a red flag to immune cells. 'Potential weapon' In the 17 patients injected with the virus, in addition to their standard treatment, at the Royal Marsden Hospital, 93% showed no trace of cancer after their tumour had been surgically removed. More than two years later, 82% of patients had not succumbed to the disease. Only two of 13 patients given the virus treatment at a high dose relapsed, the journal Clinical Cancer Research reported. There were no safety concerns with use of the virus, the researchers said, and it is hoped the virus could one day be used to fight other types of cancer. \"Around 35 to 55% of patients given the standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment typically relapse within two years, so these results compare very favourably,\" said Dr Harrington. He is now planning a trial comparing the viral treatment with the standard treatment in people newly diagn\n\nSummary:","298":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But like him or loath him, and few Ukrainians are in-between, there is something of the magician about Mikheil Saakashvili. The 49-year-old's power for reinvention, and the improbable have created a political persona that no native Ukrainian can match. This week it seemed inevitable that the next chapter of the Saakashvili story would be set in prison. He'd been arrested at his Kiev home by security officials and bundled into a police van. Prosecutors were accusing him of receiving funding from an ally of Ukraine's former President Viktor Yanukovych and a lengthy spell in jail, or possibly deportation back to Georgia seemed likely. In the best Saakashvili tradition, salvation was quite literally just round the corner. Several hundred of his supporters managed to block the police van that was taking him away. Hundreds of riot police soon arrived and in most countries you'd expect them to ultimately come out on top. But this is Ukraine, and memories are still fresh of how violent clashes and state brutality helped turn a relatively small protest into the 2014 Maidan revolution. The message from Ukraine's leaders in these situations is now clear: avoid at all costs violence that could lead to casualties and martyrs. So for several hours Mr Saakashvili's supporters wrestled and grappled with the hamstrung police. Pepper spray was used, but not much more, and the crowd steadily pulled and pushed its way closer to Mr Saakashvili's stranded police van. After three hours of grappling the inevitable occurred and Mr Saakashvili emerged Houdini-like, brandishing a handcuff on one wrist. \"We will go to parliament and call for the impeachment of (President Petro) Poroshenko, who is a thief, who is mega-corrupt and is plundering the whole of Ukraine,\" he told me just before he was swept through central Kiev by his jubilant supporters.

And just like any other playground, the bigger ones tend to play rough and keep the toys to themselves. The \"boys\" in parliament have been doing exactly that, by refusing to share their play area and their toys - or their seats and their political power. For eight years, women have been pushing for a bigger role in politics through the enactment of a law that would fulfil the requirements of the 2010 constitution, which states that \"not more than two-thirds of the members of elective public bodies shall be of the same gender\". But the latest attempt to pass the bill has failed, and now the \"boys\" and \"girls\" have gone home on a long holiday, stretching to February. Gone too is the opportunity - at least for now - to reform the playground, meaning Kenya's parliament continues to lag behind other East African countries in terms of gender balance. In Rwanda, more than 61% of MPs are women; in Tanzania it is 37%, while the figure for Uganda is 34%. In Kenya only 22% of legislators are women. So what is getting in the way of giving women a bigger voice in parliament? There are four key reasons: 1) Fear In order to satisfy the requirements of the two-thirds gender rule, 42 new female MPs would need to be nominated, raising the total number of legislators from 349 to 391. Some Kenyans fear that in a country with some of the most highly paid MPs in the world, an enlarged national assembly will mean an additional tax burden. Others are afraid that they will lose the right to decide who represents them if political parties assume the role of nominating the additional female MPs. In holding on to their toys, some male MPs have expressed the fear that the calibre of female leaders will be compromised by political parties' use of dubious nomination criteria. But paradoxically, this issue has never been raised when it comes to nominating male MPs. The playing field is clearly not level. 2) No whip Given past difficulties in pushing thr\n\nSummary:","302":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The converted Victorian bathhouse is filled with funfair nostalgia. The home, which features a retro bowling alley, a basketball arcade game and a coconut shy above the sink, went on the market in 2019. It is not just the features which were unusual. The very fact it was listed for sale was uncommon too. Listings in the UK housing market last year were down 8% on the previous year, according to property portal Rightmove. The dominant feature of the market in the last 12 months has been caution. Many potential sellers decided to stay put amid political and economic uncertainty, amid the Brexit debate and general election. A carnival-themed home may feel like the appropriate metaphor for the goings-on in Westminster last year. While this put off sellers, demand among potential buyers remained relatively stable. Low interest rates meant mortgages were relatively cheap for anyone finding a home within their budget. First-time buyer numbers were also surprisingly healthy. Debt, divorce, schools and new jobs still prompted people to move. That led to prices rising on average across the country, if only by a little, rather than wholesale property price drops. The Nationwide Building Society says, on average, UK house prices went up by 1.4% over the year. The falls were mostly seen in and around London - the market most affected by Brexit uncertainty. Other areas of the country saw prices rise faster than wages and the cost of living. Mortgage lender the Halifax suggests that Billingham in County Durham saw the biggest average price rise, up 12.3% in October 2019 compared with the same month a year earlier. Ilkeston saw a 9.1% rise over the same period. The next eight on the list - Sale, Wilmslow, Blackburn, Bolton, Burnley, Chorley, Bootle and Southport - are all in the North West of England and saw price rises of 6% \n\nSummary:","303":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Northamptonshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Adam Simmonds said he had concerns about extra match days. He said policing the railway station and town centre would add to costs. The extra total bill is separate from the costs of policing the game in and around the stadium, which are normally funded by the clubs, Mr Simmonds said. 'Challenge for police' \"We worked out that we're looking at at least \u00a3100,000,\" he said. \"We'd obviously want people to come to Northampton and have a good time [and] kick-start our local economy even more. \"The challenge for the police is that some of this is a bit of an unknown quantity.

The MPs say the UK's shale gas developers will face technological uncertainties with different geology. And public opinion may also be more sceptical, they add. The UK is a more densely populated landscape, and shale gas operations will be closer to settlements as a consequence. 'Cash sweeteners' The MPs believe operators will have to overcome potentially tighter regulations. What is more, the extent of recoverable resources in the UK is also unknown, so the report concludes that it is too soon to say whether shale gas will achieve US-style levels of success. The MPs argue that this means the Treasury cannot afford to base the UK\u2019s energy strategy on the expectation of cheap British shale gas. They urge the government to stop \"dithering\" over energy policy, though, and to ensure there is a system to rebut what \"scare stories\" may arise over the environmental impacts of shale gas. And they applaud the government's decision to offer cash sweeteners to people near shale gas facilities. Success with shale gas will reduce dependence on imports and increase tax revenues, they say, but there is a downside: if it takes off, shale gas will shatter the UK's statutory climate change targets unless the government moves much faster with carbon capture and storage technology. Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Committee, said: \"It is still too soon to call whether shale gas will provide the silver bullet needed to solve our energy problems. \"Although the US shale gas has seen a dramatic fall in domestic gas prices, a similar 'revolution' here is not certain.\" Tony Bosworth, from Friends of the Earth, responded: \"This does little to back the case for a UK shale gas revolution. \"Fracking is dirty and unnecessary \u2013 it's little wonder so many communities a\n\nSummary:","305":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Before the division of Cyprus in 1974, Varosha - a resort in Famagusta - was booming. The rich and famous were drawn by some of the best beaches on the island. Richard Burton and Brigitte Bardot all dropped by - the Argo Hotel on JFK Avenue was said to be Elizabeth Taylor's favourite. \"Anyone who comes from Varosha has a romanticised notion of it,\" says Vasia Markides, 34, an American Greek-Cypriot whose mother grew up there. \"They talk about it being the hub of art and intellectual activity. They describe it as the French Riviera of Cyprus.\" But 40 years ago, after years of inter-ethnic violence culminating in a coup inspired by Greece's ruling military junta, Turkey invaded Cyprus and occupied the northern third of the island. As its troops approached Varosha, a Greek-Cypriot community, the inhabitants fled, intending to return when the situation calmed down. However, the resort was fenced off by the Turkish military and has been a ghost town ever since. A UN resolution of 1984 calls for the handover of Varosha to UN control and prohibits any attempt to resettle it by anyone other than those who were forced out. One of them was Markides' mother Emily - she had just got married and her wedding presents were still in the attic when they abandoned the family home.

Women born in the 1950s claim the rise is unfair because they were not given enough time to make adjustments to cope with years without a state pension. They argued the changes were discrimination, but judges disagreed. In a summary of the High Court's decision, the judges said: \"There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law. Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men.\" The court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was \"it could be justified on the facts\". To chants of \"the fight goes on\" from supporters, Joanne Welch, who led the campaign, said outside court: \"Where do we go from here? Well, where will the government go from here is the better question.\" She referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to look at the state pension age issue with \"fresh vigour\", adding: \"We will be holding you to that undertaking.\" She said she was \"rather puzzled\" by the court's ruling, but added: \"We can take this, we've got broad shoulders.\" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"We welcome the High Court's judgment.

But speaking to BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme, she said the Tories - who she has ruled out working with - were \"not relevant\" in the assembly. A Conservative party spokesman responded by saying Leanne Wood was the only person in Wales who believed this, adding: \"In reality, most voters know that a vote for Plaid Cymru is a vote for Labour.\" He added that \"despite general election coverage beyond their wildest dreams\", Plaid had failed to make an impression outside the seats they already held. \"Voters seeking respite from 17 painful years of Labour dominance will be looking to Andrew RT Davies and the Welsh Conservatives to deliver a new Wales, and we will be taking that positive message to the doorsteps between now and May 2016,\" he said. Plaid failed to add to its tally of three parliamentary seats at the general election. The party's campaign was criticised by one of its most prominent AMs, former Plaid leader Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas. His comments have angered some in the party and Ms Wood confirmed Plaid's national executive is talking to his local party about whether to take action against him.

But more than 2,000 people have signed a petition calling for a public consultation on the general waste changes, which were approved last week. The council said the changes would save 4,000 tonnes of rubbish from landfill and cut carbon emissions. Speaking to BBC Radio Berkshire, Linsie Keen, from Bracknell, said: \"It just really annoyed me that the council have yet again made another massive decision that is going to affect everyone in our borough without any type of consultation. \"People are saying they do not want a three-week collection because they can not hold the waste any longer. \"And you are talking about people that can't get to the local refuse tip. How are they going to cope with the extra waste? \"Trying to manage waste for three weeks is going to be a nightmare.\" The changes to the general waste bins would apply only to houses and not flats. The council said this money saved could be put into other essential services as well as helping to tackle climate change. Council leader Paul Bettison said: \"The only material they would have to keep for three weeks is anything other than food or other recycling.\" Residents are set to get a five litre indoor food waste caddy before the first collection on 5 October, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).\n\nSummary:","311":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

In the state of Baja California Sur - popular with tourists - some hotels and restaurants also resumed activities. Mexico has confirmed more than 150,000 infections and about 17,500 deaths. However, the true numbers are thought to be much higher because of insufficient testing. The country has Latin America's second-highest death toll - after Brazil - and the region's third-highest total of cases, after Brazil and Chile, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. Under a phased reopening announced by Mexico City's authorities, about 340,000 factory workers returned to their jobs on Tuesday. Small shops will be able to reopen on Thursday while professional services and some other workers are allowed go back from Friday. Street markets and the historic city centre could be allowed to reopen next week if conditions were deemed appropriate, authorities said. Churches and restaurants would also be able to resume activities at a reduced capacity. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is eager to restart the economy, and his government announced a phased plan to lift restrictions. But critics say he was slow to impose the measures and now has been too quick to lift them. Most of the economy was stopped from 23 March but some industries that were declared key to the functioning of the nation were exempt from the restrictions. Between March and May, more than one million jobs were lost across the country, according to official numbers. The impact of the measures, however, is thought to be much worse as Mexico has high numbers of people in the informal economy. On Monday, beaches reopened in Baja California Sur, home to the popular twin resorts of Los Cabos. Hotels and restaurants can only operate at 30% capacity, and people are being urged to follow social-distancing measures.

The Government suspended all practical driving tests from 5 January in England, except for critical workers who need to drive as part of their job. Learner drivers taking tests this week have admitted feeling \"rusty\". Jade Bone, from Southampton, has gone more than three months without driving due to the ban on lessons, which was only lifted in England last week. The 24-year-old has her test booked for Thursday. She said: \"My confidence has been knocked a bit,\" she said. \"In my first couple of lessons back I was really rusty. \"Although I haven't forgotten how to do things, my general confidence with driving isn't what it was before. I'm a bit more hesitant now. I'm doubting myself.\" Her instructor Rob Fenn, of RED Driving School, said many of his students have \"gone backwards\" from being \"test-ready\" in January. He added the demand for driving instructors has shot up, and tests were \"essentially fully booked\" due to pent-up demand. Ms Bone said she was concerned if she does not pass this week, she might not get another chance to take the test until August due to the backlog of candidates. She added: \"That's quite frustrating and a scary prospect, especially because it's an expensive thing to do, having lessons.\" Another learner taking a test this week, Olivia Watts, 17, of Chelmsford, Essex, struggled to make a booking. \"I had to wait for a cancellation because there weren't any tests available until around August or September.\" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said earlier this month that the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will \"offer more tests and more examiners\" in a bid to meet demand, including additional slots at weekends and on bank holidays.

He is the first South American winner of the prize since 1982 when it went to Colombian Gabriel Garcia Marquez. In the previous six years, the academy awarded the 10 million kronor (\u00a3938,000) prize to five Europeans and one Turk, sparking criticism that it was too Euro-centric. The Swedish Academy's Peter Englund said Vargas Llosa was \"a divinely gifted story-teller,\" whose writing touched the reader. 'Total surprise' Mr Englund added that the writer was in New York and was told by telephone that he had won the prize. Vargas Llosa is currently teaching at Princeton University. \"I will try to survive the Nobel Prize,\" he joked during a news conference later on Thursday. \"It was a total surprise.\" But he said the honour would not affect his craft. \"I don't think the Nobel Prize will change my writing, my style, my themes,\" he said. Previously, the author had told the BBC's Latin American service that \"a writer shouldn't think about the Nobel prize as it is bad for one's writing\". Born in the town of Arequipa, Vargas Llosa took Spanish nationality in 1993 - three years after an unsuccessful bid for the Peruvian presidency. The author had long been mentioned as a possible Nobel candidate - he has won some of the Western world's most prestigious literary medals including the Cervantes Prize in 1995 - the Spanish-speaking world's most distinguished literary honour. His works have also been translated into 31 languages, including Chinese, Croatian, Hebrew and Arabic. Burnt copies The writer's international breakthrough came with the 1960s novel The Time of The Hero which built on his experiences at the Peruvian military academy, Leoncio Prado.

Built in the mid-1960s to tackle the city's housing crisis, the flats once provided accommodation for almost 5,000 people. The demolition programme, which changes the city's skyline, is part of Glasgow Housing Association's renewal plan. There were eight tower blocks in total and when they were built, at 292ft (89m), they were the tallest residential structures in Europe. Initially they were regarded as the answer to Glasgow's housing problem but in recent years have become rundown and vandalised, and stand largely empty. Alex McGuire, from Glasgow Housing Association, said: \"The Red Road flats were popular in their day and are known around the world, but their time has come to an end. \"We're pleased the demolition of the first of the Red Road blocks went according to plan.\" As final preparations for the demolition got under way, Red Road was trending on Twitter. About 275 kilos of explosives were used to bring down the triple block. Due to the unique steel-frame structure of the flats, the bottom storeys remained - as planned - undisturbed after the blowdown. These will be demolished using machines. About 2,000 people were temporarily removed from their homes with many of the local residents staying with family or friends or visiting the evacuation centre at All Saints Secondary School. The clear-up operation will take several months to complete. William Sinclair, from demolition contractors Safedem, said: \"The Red Road flats have presented a unique series of challenges ranging from the size of the buildings to the steel frame structure. \"We're delighted to be involved in another successful demolition.\" In recent years the flats had been home to refugees from many countries.

It is believed to centre on bullying. Mr Bercow, who stood down from his role last year, said Lord Lisvane had \"ample opportunity\" to raise issues in their five years working together. In a statement, Mr Bercow said: \"At no stage did he do so, even though he became Clerk of the House - the most senior official. The timing of this intervention is curious.\" The former Speaker, who spent 10 years in the role, has faced other accusations of bullying during his time in office, but has denied all the claims. There have been reports Mr Bercow - who previously sat as a Conservative MP - has been nominated for a peerage by the outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. No 10 said the allegations were \"very concerning\" and should be \"investigated thoroughly\". The prime minister's spokesman added: \"There can be no place for bullying or abuse in Westminster or any workplace, and it is important that the parliamentary leadership responds fully and promptly to any concerns which are raised.\" Lord Lisvane began working at the House of Commons in 1972 and has held a number of procedural roles, including clerk for Private Members' Bills and clerk for the European Scrutiny Committee. He became Clerk Assistant and Director General of the Chamber and Committee Services in 2009, before stepping up to the Clerk of the House of Commons in 2011. After standing down in 2014, he became a life peer and sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher.

Alex Neil said allegations that the \"organs of the state\" conspired against Mr Salmond had been central to the former first minister's defence. He said a judge-led inquiry was needed to establish whether the \"very serious\" claims of a conspiracy were true. The women who made the allegations against Mr Salmond included an SNP politician, a party worker and several current and former Scottish government civil servants and officials. During his evidence to the court, Mr Salmond said the allegations were \"deliberate fabrications for a political purpose\" and had been aimed at preventing him from making a political comeback. Mr Neil told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Clearly the allegation is that it was a conspiracy involving a number of people to do in Alex Salmond.\" The former health secretary said he did not know whether there had been a conspiracy or not. But he added: \"If the organs of the state like the civil service, the Crown Office and government advisers were involved in any such conspiracy, that's a very serious matter. \"So my view is that, once the coronavirus crisis is over, there needs to be an independent judge-led inquiry to find out was there a conspiracy, if there was what was the conspiracy, who was involved and was there criminality involved in such a conspiracy.\" Mr Salmond's defence team had claimed during the trial that a senior Scottish government official known as Woman A, who was one of his accusers, had contacted some of the other complainers before Mr Salmond was charged. Speaking outside court after his acquittal, Mr Salmond said there was \"certain evidence\" that he had not been able to use during the trial but which would \"see the light of day\" after the coronavirus crisis had passed.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the move would help take back control of fishing access to UK waters. The European Commission said it \"took note\" but felt the convention had been superseded by EU law. Ireland's minister for agriculture, food and the marine, Michael Creed, however, said it was \"unwelcome and unhelpful\". \"Brexit poses very serious challenges to the seafood sector and this announcement will form part of the negotiations,\" he said. The Scottish government backed the idea, saying it had been pressing for it \"for some time\". The London Fisheries Convention sits alongside the EU Common Fisheries Policy, which allows all European Union countries access between 12 and 200 nautical miles of the UK and sets quotas for how much fish nations can catch. The relationship between the UK and Ireland is further governed by a separate arrangement. 'Historic step' Withdrawing from the convention, which was signed in 1964 before the UK joined what became the EU, means UK vessels will also lose the right to fish in waters six to 12 nautical miles offshore of the other countries. What happens to the 12 to 200 mile area will be one of the issues at stake in Brexit negotiations. Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr the change was about \"taking back control\" of UK waters, 6-12 miles from the coast. When the UK left the EU it would become an \"independent coastal state\", he said. He said the EU's common fisheries policy had been an environmental disaster and the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future. But the SNP's Richard Lochhead, who held the post of fisheries minister in Scotland until last year, has concerns around fishing being used as a \"bargaining chip\" by the government, which would \"let down UK fishermen\". \"Michael Gove is doing his best to get maximum publicity out of the easy \n\nSummary:","318":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Mr Seery collapsed at home one evening in April and was rushed into the University Hospital of North Tees in Stockton with dangerously low oxygen levels. The following morning, Mrs Seery was called by doctors who said her husband was \"not going to make it\". \"It was horrendous,\" she said, adding: \"I was pacing up and down waiting for the phone to ring again, but also not wanting it to ring as I didn't want to hear what they might have to say.\" Before she could get to hospital, his low oxygen levels started to improve and he was getting better.

Of the 13 Guernsey beaches listed, only five were recommended as having \"excellent water quality\". Guernsey's Environment Department said the number of samples it took fell from 20 in 2012 to eight in 2013. Minister Roger Domaille said the number of tests had been cut to save about \u00a320,000 a year under a government savings programme. The spokeswoman said the reduction in the number of tests meant one poor sample could significantly change the outcome. \"It should be borne in mind that these test results are 'snapshots' of the bathing water quality at a specific time,\" she added. \"There is now considerable research which shows that bathing water quality may be lowered by the run-off during heavy rainfall from roads, streams, and agricultural fields. \"Given the historically excellent standard of bathing water in Guernsey and continuing improvements by Guernsey Water there is every reason to be confident that Guernsey will continue to have some of the most beautiful beaches and good bathing conditions in Europe.\" Rachel Wyatt, from the Marine Conservation Society, said a number of factors could affect a sample. She said: \"What we are looking at is an elevated level of bacteria. \"That can come from livestock, faeces from dogs, birds or maybe from the sewage systems.\" In Jersey, 13 of the 16 listed beaches received recommended status.

He declined to reveal how much money the firm was putting into scheme, saying only that a consortium of firms had invested $450m (\u00a3280m) in total. Faster links The project to construct and maintain APG is funded by a group that includes two large Chinese internet service providers, China Telecom and China Unicom. The fibre-optic cable will help the countries send and receive data to North America faster, according to consortium leader Time Dotcom. \"This lowers our dependencies on Singapore as the main gateway for internet traffic,\" said its chief executive Saiful Husni. \"We can now channel high volumes of this traffic on our network with the lowest latency [access time], directly to the US.\" Internet traffic can be slowed by the number of \"hops\" traffic has to make as it traverses different stretches of cables, and as it passes through different landing stations.

Kenya's police chief said investigations had shown no links with the Somali militant group al-Shabab. It comes a week after Kenya sent troops to Somalia to track down members of the group, which Nairobi blames for several kidnappings. Al-Shabab threatened reprisals if the troops did not leave. The al-Qaeda-linked Islamist group, which controls much of southern and central Somalia, has denied carrying out any abductions. The BBC's Will Ross in Nairobi says last December three people died during a grenade attack at a bus in Nairobi. It was never clear who was behind it. 'Covered in blood' Kenya's most senior police officer Matthew Iteere told journalists in Nairobi said the grenade attack had no links to al-Shabab - although an investigation into the motive was ongoing. He said that a Russian-made grenade was used inside the nightclub. A local news station, Capital News Radio, quoted a witness as saying a man had asked to be let in to the Mwauras bar in central Nairobi shortly after 03:00 (0000 GMT). He then hurled a grenade and fled the scene, said the witness. Lawrence Kioko, who was injured in the attack, told Reuters news agency: \"I heard an explosion - there was darkness and I thought the electricity had gone out but when I touched my face, there was blood.\" Video footage showed blood and beer bottles on the floor of the nightclub - upturned seats and debris littered the floor. \"The guys came out running covered in blood. We helped them wash the blood off and they were carried away in ambulances,\" Jacob Musembi, an eyewitness, told Reuters. Police cordoned off the area. No group has so far admitted carrying out the attack.

The site is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and Haram al-Sharif to Muslims. The resolution caused Israel to freeze co-operation with Unesco last week. The stated aim of the text was \"the safeguarding of the cultural heritage of Palestine and the distinctive character of East Jerusalem\". It criticises Israel's activities at holy places in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank. 'Playing games' But it is how it refers to the sites which prompted Israel to act against the cultural body. While acknowledging the \"importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions\", the document refers to the sacred hilltop only by the name \"al-Aqsa Mosque\/al-Haram al-Sharif\" (Noble Sanctuary). It is the location of two Biblical Jewish temples and is flanked by the Western Wall, venerated by Jews as part of the original supporting wall of the temple compound. Haram al-Sharif is also the place where Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, and is the third holiest site in Islam. The draft refers to the precinct in front of the wall as \"al-Buraq Plaza 'Western Wall Plaza'\" - placing single quote marks only around \"Western Wall\", giving the name as it is known to Jews less weight than the one by which it is known to Muslims. Unesco's executive board chairman Michael Worbs said on Friday he would have liked more time to work out a compromise.

The proposed law would give foreign investors 99-year leases on SEZ land. MPs had been set to vote on it this week but this has been delayed. The decision to postpone the vote in an attempt to defuse the protests was seen as a major concession by the ruling communist party in response to large-scale street demonstrations. The chairwoman of parliament, Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, said that people's opinions \"will always be heard\". China's embassy in Hanoi has warned its citizens to be careful, referring to the protests as \"illegal gatherings\" that had included some \"anti-China content\". Demonstrators had gathered in various parts of the country over the weekend, including the major urban centres of Hanoi, the capital, and Ho Chi Minh City. Some carried anti-China banners, including one reading: \"No leasing land to China even for one day.\" Protests in the cities were quickly suppressed, but authorities faced much greater public anger in Binh Thuan, where demonstrators threw rocks, set vehicles alight, and briefly occupied the local government headquarters. State media outlets said dozens of police officers were injured. On Monday, police formed barricades with their shields across roads into the town, and numerous explosions could be heard, as tear gas was fired into the crowd. At a fire station attacked by protesters, riot police are reported to have laid down their shields and equipment and withdrawn in an apparent peace gesture. Why are the economic zones controversial? The bill offers companies operating in the SEZs greater incentives and fewer restrictions, in an attempt to promote growth in target areas.

Mr Key said the flag represented a period of history from which New Zealand had moved on. \"It's my belief... that the design of the New Zealand flag symbolises a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed,\" he said in a speech at Victoria University. \"The flag remains dominated by the Union Jack in a way that we ourselves are no longer dominated by the United Kingdom.\" \"I am proposing that we take one more step in the evolution of modern New Zealand by acknowledging our independence through a new flag.\" Mr Key said that he liked the silver fern - popularised by national teams including the All Blacks - as an option, saying efforts by New Zealand's athletes gave \"the silver fern on a black background a distinctive and uniquely New Zealand identity\".

He admitted attacking Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly at a service station in County Cavan on 1 February 2019. The two directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings, which has since been rebranded Mannok, were having lunch in Ballyconnell when they were attacked. McGovern, an amateur boxer, punched Mr Lunney up to eight times in the face, leaving the chief operating officer with a broken nose and swollen eye. Cavan Circuit Court was told that he also threw a cup of boiling water in the face of Mr O'Reilly, the chief financial officer. On the previous day, McGovern's father had been fired from his job as a driver with the company. The court was told that McGovern had no involvement in subsequent events in September 2019, when Mr Lunney was abducted and tortured by a gang. 'Get on with my life' A Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police force) sergeant read to the court a statement written by Mr Lunney in which he said the attack and resulting injury \"was very painful for me and extremely upsetting for my family\". \"Our only desire is to ensure that the law is upheld and this type of behaviour is stopped,\" Mr Lunny's statement read. \"I wish to move on from this incident and leave the matter in the hands of the court. \"I bear Mr McGovern no ill will.\" Mr O'Reilly also gave a statement in which he said: \"While I was in shock and upset at the time of the incident, I want to put the incident behind me and get on with my life. \"I hope that if the court sees fit Mr McGovern can get on with his life too in a socially positive manner.\" A defence lawyer described the two statements as \"magnanimous\" and indicated that all of those involved wanted to put the matter behind them.

Education Minister Huw Lewis has written to the sector saying a final decision has not been taken. The body that represents FE colleges said it would be difficult for them to cope with the cuts. The Welsh government is in the process of drawing up its spending plans and a clearer picture is expected to emerge when it publishes its draft budget in the autumn. In a letter to principals seen by BBC Wales, Mr Lewis said FE funding had been under discussion since UK Chancellor George Osborne's spending review in June. \"To date, although no firm decisions on future budget settlements have been taken, institutions have been told to plan on a reduction of at least 5% in 2014\/15,\" he said. \"Further information will be available when the next draft budget is published in October and the Welsh government will work closely with Colegau Cymru to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning.\" Colegau Cymru, the body that represents FE colleges, said the sector had already had to make savings after a series of \"tough\" budget settlements had failed to keep pace with inflation. Its chief executive John Graystone said: \"That (5%) is a big cut for colleges. \"That represents something around about \u00a315m to \u00a320m so it's going to be difficult for colleges to deliver to their current agenda, their current profile with that sort of level.\" With colleges facing the twin demands of tackling disadvantage and delivering skills, he said they would need to \"weigh up both of those key priorities and see where they go with each of those\". It comes after FE colleges were told over the summer that they would be getting an unexpected funding cut of 1.5% this year, taking their Welsh government funding to around \u00a3310m.

He confirmed bonuses would be cut, and he would waive his own. He said he need not have resigned even though he was in charge at Barclaycard during one mis-selling episode. Earlier, the bank said it had set aside another \u00a31bn to cover the costs of the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI) to individuals and interest rate hedging products to small firms. Mr Jenkins was in charge at Barclaycard at a time when PPI was mis-sold. 'Difficult year' Mr Jenkins took over as chief executive in August. He told MPs he repeatedly raised concerns with the board and Mr Diamond over the culture at the bank, and that \"actions\" were needed rather than words. He said the bonus pool for 2012 had already been \"substantially\" reduced and would be cut further owing to the mis-selling issues. Mr Jenkins said last week he would waive his bonus for 2012 after a \"very difficult\" year for the bank. He would have been entitled to a maximum of \u00a32.75m, in addition to his \u00a31.1m salary. Details of the full bonus pool are expected with the company's annual results next Tuesday.

Through those kinds of intimate scenarios we can definitely know each other very well,\" says Mr Deng. Mr Yu is chairman of the New Oriental Group, one of China's biggest educational service businesses, and Mr Deng is chair of Northern Light Venture Capital, a Chinese venture capital firm. Both are members of the exclusive China Entrepreneur Club (CEC), a not-for-profit group of 46 of China's top entrepreneurs and business leaders. Already good friends from their membership of the club, which includes trips to each other's workplaces, nights out and annual trips abroad together, their experience that day was a classic example of having so-called good \"guanxi\". Roughly translated as \"relationships\" or \"connections\", it is a crucial part of life in China. Having good \"guanxi\" - a wide network of mutually beneficial relationships developed outside the formal work setting, for instance at evening meals or over drinks - is often the secret to securing a business deal. Mr Yu, who is on the board of the CEC, says it is because of this that the number of CEC members is limited. The small group size ensures people can really get to know one another, build close connections and ultimately help each other out. \"We have had a lot of occasions for example, when members are in trouble or got into difficulty the entire club is behind a person, or we divert a lot of time to help that particular member through a difficult time,\" says fellow CEC member Charles Chao, the chairman and chief executive of online media firm Sina Corporation.

That led to the arrests and subsequent fining of three women aged 21, 41 and 58, and five men aged between 19 and 58. Police said a 20-year-old man from Leicester, arrested on suspicion of organising a large gathering in breach of Covid-19 restrictions, had been bailed. \"Although under normal circumstances we accept and protect people's right to protest, under current legislation, attending a protest is not considered an exception to leaving your house and is unlawful,\" Ch Supt Kim Madill said on Saturday.

That morning Radio 1 Breakfast had revealed him as the UK's entry at the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest in the Netherlands. James decided taking part in the world's largest live music event was \"too good an opportunity to turn down\". \"It's a baptism of fire for a new artist.\" After the UK finished in last place in 2019, James' participation was seen as a new direction for the country's involvement in the contest. But coronavirus put a stop to it. On 18 March the Eurovision Song Contest was cancelled for the first time in its 64-year history. Organisers called the decision \"difficult\" and said everyone involved in the contest was \"heartbroken\". At that point the UK was fast approaching lockdown and James said he was \"expecting\" the announcement but was still \"absolutely gutted\". \"I was meant to be singing on the stage in front of a TV audience of 200 million and 20,000 people in an arena - but what's more important is people's health.\" James was one of 41 acts who were due to compete in the Dutch city of Rotterdam.

Children's minister Edward Timpson said former health minister, Lord Norman Warner, will be the new commissioner. The appointment follows a report handed to ministers last month. 'Challenge and support' Under the plans announced by the Department for Education (DfE), the local authority will still retain control of its children's services. Between 2007 and November 2013 there were 20 serious case reviews in Birmingham, following the deaths of youngsters like Khyra Ishaq in 2008 and Keanu Williams, in 2011. A peer review in February suggested improvements were being made in the department and a \u00a310m investment plan was announced by the council in December. Mr Timpson said however, he remained very concerned about the safety of children in Birmingham. He said an independent panel of experts would also be set up to \"challenge and support\" the city council. Council leader Sir Albert Bore said he welcomed the recommendations and the report set out a \"compelling account of the reasons for, and the lengthy history of shortcomings\". \"In doing so, it also highlights the significant challenges that come from the scale of deprivation facing communities in Birmingham,\" he said. Commenting on his appointment, Lord Warner said vulnerable children in Birmingham deserved \"to receive the care and protection that they can rely on when the responsible adult has failed them\". He said he would work with the city council to put in place the \"immediate improvements needed\".

But that was better than the previous month's reading of 51.1, which had marked a 16-month low. The eurozone economy has seen 18 months of continuous, albeit weak growth. Markit said its latest PMI survey, which combines the results of individual surveys of the construction, services and manufacturing industries, suggested the eurozone economy grew by just 0.1% in the last three months of 2014. Persistently low inflation since the start of last year has led consumers and business to hold off making purchases or making investments in the expectation that prices will continue to fall. The problem has been exacerbated since the summer by the falling price of oil. Brent crude has fallen by more than 50% since August to $51.54 per barrel. The fear of deflation led the European Central Bank (ECB) to lower interest rates to 0.05% and begin an asset purchase programme to inject cash into the economy in August. However, the ECB has resisted taking the same action as central banks in the US, UK and Japan by buying government debt. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said the weakness of the latest PMI surveys would \"add to calls for more aggressive central bank stimulus, including full-scale quantitative easing, to be undertaken as soon as possible\". Grexit He added: \"The euro zone will look upon 2014 as a year in which recession was avoided by the narrowest of margins, but the weakness of the survey data suggests there's no guarantee that a renewed downturn will not be seen in 2015.\" Analysts expect the ECB to announce its bond-buying programme - also known as quantitative easing - later this month.

The newspaper's review, by critic Ann Treneman, concluded: \"Roar it out: this is a hit.\" The Daily Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish, meanwhile, declared it \"a worthy successor to War Horse\". He wrote: \"We've been waiting a while for the 'next' War Horse - a theatrical phenomenon that can hold a family audience spell-bound, spur the imagination and make the heart race... It looks as though that moment has arrived.\" Cavendish awarded the play four stars, and said that if there's a shortcoming, \"it's that it leaves you craving more\". Martel's Booker Prize-winning novel told the story of a 16-year-old Indian boy who sets off to emigrate with his family, but becomes trapped on a lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean with a tiger for company. It was adapted for the big screen in 2012 in a film directed by Ang Lee, which won the filmmaker one of four Oscars. The Guardian's Mark Fisher described the way the new stage show switches between settings as \"a triumph of transformative stagecraft\", and praised Hiran Abeysekera's \"superb central performance\". \"If it underplays the novel's tone of helpless desperation, boredom and privation, it nonetheless does tremendous justice to the author's imaginative canvas,\" he wrote.

The judge had said there was evidence Skydrive's name had caused confusion among the public. Microsoft had originally said it would appeal. The tech company said it has now agreed to change the name worldwide after a \"transition period\". In a joint statement, Microsoft and BSkyB said: \"The settlement of this case reflects the desire of both companies to focus on joint projects to benefit their customers.\" UK owners of Microsoft's Xbox 360 can access Sky's channels via the games console and there have been reports that the two are in talks for a deeper tie-up with the forthcoming Xbox One. Mistaken belief Although BSkyB ended its Store & Share cloud storage service at the end of 2011, it had argued that Microsoft's use of the word \"sky\" in its brand posed a problem since it still ran other digital services including its Sky Broadband and Sky Go video streaming products. In her ruling, the judge noted that customers having problems with Microsoft's product had ended up calling the broadcaster's helpline in the mistaken belief it was responsible for the service. It marks the second time in recent months that BSkyB has successfully defended its trademark against a tech company. At the end of last year Livescribe - the US maker of products that record a digital version of their owner's handwriting - pulled its Sky pen from UK stores after receiving a legal challenge from the broadcaster.

Police say that he was the suspect in an assault case and was interfering with medics who were working on the victim when he was he was shot. Protesters have camped outside the police station for two days, and blocked a major highway on Monday. That demonstration led to the arrest of 51 protesters on Monday night. Police have released few details about the shooting of Clark - who some say was handcuffed when he was shot. Police have denied that claim. Monday night's demonstrations came after the mayor's decision to ask the federal government to launch a civil rights investigation. Mayor Betsy Hodges said she was asking for the investigation in the \"interest of transparency and community confidence\". While a state agency has already launched a criminal investigation, the mayor said that the city needs \"all the tools we have available to us\". Two officers involved in the shooting are on paid leave - which is standard procedure after incidents such as this. The police chief has said that the officers were not wearing body cameras, but would not say whether the squad car or other surveillance video captured the incident. Protesters have welcomed the federal investigation, but have vowed to continue demonstrating until any video of the situation is released and the officers involved are identified. The protests began on Sunday and included an overnight encampment at a Minneapolis police station near the scene of the shooting. At least eight tents were seen at the campsite on Monday, and a few protesters were sitting inside the glass doors of the station - including one who was knitting. \"We're still not moving until we get that footage,\" said Michael McDowell, a demonstrator with the Black Lives Matter movement.

While his family has been told he can be released, his mother Jane Lawrence said they do not know how to get him out of the war-torn country safely. She said her son risks being kidnapped by a rival group if he leaves prison. Luke converted to Islam in his late teens - taking the name Jamal, before moving to Yemen, where he married his Yemeni wife Tagreed. They have a young son. Two years ago, when he presented his British passport to withdraw money to fund his family's passage out of Yemen, Luke was arrested. His family in Cardiff says the Houthi rebels holding Luke in the capital city of Sanaa, will release him if he is escorted out by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC). Yemen is currently engulfed by a civil war that has claimed thousands of lives. Many routes are unsafe for travel and the family has been told the only safe route out of Sanaa is via neighbouring Djibouti. But Luke and his wife were badly treated in Djibouti when they previously tried to get out through that port in 2015, his family said. They added that it was because of that experience, Luke and his wife felt they had no option but to go back to Yemen, despite the prevailing advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to leave. The family said it would be unsafe for Luke to be taken back to Djibouti now as there was no British consular presence. They have set up their own fundraising appeal to cover flights, hotels and insurance costs involved in getting the family out, and a visa application for Luke's wife. Ms Lawrence said when she was told Luke's name had been cleared she \"couldn't believe it\". \"But then all of a sudden we had all these hurdles to get over. Where were they going to take him?

Boyle auditioned pupils at the school to appear in the film and held a master class and workshop. Pupil Ethan Smith, 16, from Lowestoft, said: \"Danny Boyle is an amazing man. He spent a lot of time helping us.\" Ethan successfully auditioned in front of Boyle for a part and said he had been \"massively inspired\" to study acting at college. \"You hear so much about celebrities and never get to speak to them and they came and talked to us and told us about the different routes to a career in acting,\" he said. Another pupil who starred in the Beatles-inspired film, Daisy Parr, 15, also from Lowestoft, said she was also thinking of acting as a career after featuring in the movie. \"Seeing the filming process was really eye-opening, how the same scene is film from many different angles,\" she said. The movie was also filmed on Gorleston beach in Norfolk, Halesworth in Suffolk and Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The school pupils will be attending the East Coast Cinema in Lowestoft on 28 June for a red carpet showing of the film on the day it is officially released. Downton Abbey actress Lily James spent a number of days at the school earlier in the year, researching her part as a teacher. Hannah Morris, head of performing arts at the school, said: \"Both students and staff have been hugely excited and inspired by the opportunity to see the work of two of the greats of British cinema close at hand.\" She said she thought James would make a \"wonderful\" teacher in real life.

The idea is that a passport would certify that you have had coronavirus and will not carry or contract the disease again, opening up a way out of lockdown restrictions for the holder. But is this theory correct? And will it create a group of antibody-carrying elite who can date, travel and work as they wish, while others are still limited by health precautions? 'I know I'm clear, we should meet!' Pam Evans, from Aberdeen, has just had a rude awakening to the new reality of internet dating. She says that a man who was interested in meeting her took a novel approach. \"I had one guy at the weekend: 'I've just been tested last week for Covid so I know I'm clear, we should meet up' And I said: 'Oh no, absolutely not'... he became just absolutely abusive straight away.\" Pam's hopeful date was trying to take advantage of his apparent negative coronavirus test result as a reason to break lockdown rules to visit her. Is this a sign of how those who get a certificate stating they've already had coronavirus might use their privileged position in society? In New York, people are using antibody tests - showing that they have been exposed to the virus and have recovered - as a way of suggesting they are safe to date. They are photographing positive test results to use as a kind of improvised \"Covid-immunity passport\". If you have antibodies, the theory goes, you will not get the disease again. Dating aside, what if we could decide who is safe to return to work or get on an aircraft? For those people. the Covid-19 lockdown could be over. 'Immunity passports' The idea behind immunity passports, is that of a certificate confirming that you have had Covid-19.

They found bad dreams improved the effectiveness of the brain in reacting to frightening experiences when awake. But really terrifying nightmares were found to have a negative impact. The neuroscientists, from the University of Geneva, the University Hospitals of Geneva in Switzerland and the University of Wisconsin in the US, have suggested that dreams could be used as a form of therapy for anxiety disorders. Dreams 'prepare for real-life danger' The study looked at whether bad dreams - which are moderately frightening rather than excessively traumatic - might serve a useful purpose. With more than 250 electrodes attached to 18 subjects - and with another 89 people keeping diaries of their sleeping and dreaming - the researchers examined how the emotions experienced during dreams were connected with feelings when awake. The findings, published in Human Brain Mapping, showed that bad dreams helped people to \"react better to frightening situations\". When someone woke after a bad dream, the area of the brain that controlled their response to fear was found to be more effective. This suggested that bad dreams were a way of preparing people for fear in their waking lives. The greater the frequency of frightening dreams, the researchers found a higher level of activity in the area of the brain that manages fear. \"We were particularly interested in fear. What areas of our brain are activated when we're having bad dreams?\" said Lampros Perogamvros, a researcher in the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory at the University of Geneva. Nightmare emotions The researchers said they found a \"very strong link between the emotions we feel in both sleep and wakefulness\", with bad dreams being a way of simulating frightening situations as a rehearsal for such experiences when awake. \"Dreams may be considered as a real t\n\nSummary:","354":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Coronavirus The executive managed to navigate its way through the first wave of the pandemic - although it was bumpy at times - but now comes the challenge of continuing to manage the virus. Schools have returned and the executive says keeping kids in class is its top priority, so if new cases continue to rise, other lockdown restrictions could be re-imposed in order to keep schools open. There is also still the added problem of ensuring the executive's messaging is consistent and joined-up. DUP leader Arlene Foster and Sinn F\u00e9in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill are still not doing press conferences together due to Ms O'Neill's attendance at the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June, which led to accusations she had breached Covid-19 public health guidelines. Health Minister Robin Swann and his officials have been appearing at the podium on a regular basis over the past few weeks, but there have been calls for the first and deputy first ministers to step up again and jointly field questions on the executive's decisions. Furlough The Treasury-led scheme is winding down and is due to stop at the end of October. That presents a problem for the executive, given how many firms in NI have relied heavily on the scheme. Stormont's Department for the Economy estimated that more than 200,000 workers had initially been furloughed, with almost 330,000 people in NI receiving some kind of government financial aid due to the pandemic. Although a lot of businesses have been able to bring back some of their staff, others have not and the executive warned that the possibility of 100,000 people in Northern Ireland claiming unemployment benefits by Christmas is a \"conservative estimate\". With the extra help from Westminster drying up, that leaves questions for the executive in terms of how it plans to manage this and support busin\n\nSummary:","356":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

If he had won, he would have faced an Israeli athlete in the next round. Iran does not recognise the state of Israel and bans its athletes from competing against Israelis. Iran's wrestling federation has said it will challenge the ban, which was announced by the United World Wrestling Disciplinary Chamber on Friday. \"Karimachiani, on instruction of his coach Jamshidi, wilfully lost his 1\/8 finals match against Alikhan Zhabrilov,\" the chamber said, referring to the Russian opponent in the match. \"Both wrestler and coach were found to have acted in direct violation of the International Wrestling Rules... and the UWW Disciplinary Regulations,\" it added. Karimachiani's ban was set to run for two years from the date of the incident - making him eligible to compete in late May 2018. His coach, Hamidreza Jamshidi, was also banned from the sport until the end of November 2019. During the November 2017 match-up in Poland, Karimachiani was leading 3-2 in the fourth minute of the match. Winning would have set him up against Israel's Uri Kalashnikov in the next bout.

The Local Government Association claims ministers are reducing council grants by \u00a3350m more than they will save. The government said the double funding of services was not sustainable. Local education authorities face cuts of \u00a3413m over the next two years tied to the expansion in the academies programme. However, Department for Education figures suggest they will only save a maximum of \u00a360m from the changes if 200 schools convert to academy status each year. This would leave them about \u00a3350m out of pocket, says the LGA. Its chairman Baroness Margaret Eaton said: \"We have made it clear that school choice is something that councils support. But it cannot be fair for local taxpayers to subsidise the roll-out of the academies programme. \"As it stands, councils face a bill of \u00a3413m at a time when their budgets are already facing an unprecedented squeeze. \"This is unacceptable when the saving from not having to provide central services to academies is less than one seventh of that amount. \"Whatever you think of academies, it cannot be right that other frontline services suffer so that the government's academies programme can flourish.\" She called on the government to think again about how it pays for academies to be set up.

It seems people do not know where to vent their anger now but hostility hangs in the air. Inside the mosque, the sight is shocking. Beyond the blood-soaked steps, the floor is strewn with debris: scattered prayer mats, beads, smashed spectacles and pages from the Koran. There are bullet marks on the pillars and the suicide bombers' blood can be seen splattered across the walls and right up inside the dome. \"We heard a loud sound outside, but people said let's continue praying,\" said Adamu Magashi, who was inside facing the imam who had just finished his sermon at the time of the attack. \"Then a bomb went off right inside the mosque and somebody started shooting. We tried to move towards the imam and there was another blast - we couldn't even see each other as we tried to escape,\" he told me after returning to the scene. Attackers beaten Outside, a large crowd stands over the twisted remains of the motorbikes and bicycles that were engulfed in the flames when the first bomber struck, driving a car into the assembled worshippers. Policemen occasionally disperse the agitated throng. Another crowd stares at a collection of blackened shoes that has been gathered up in the large open sandy area in front of the green domed mosque. \"This was the first time ever the five daily prayers were not observed in this mosque,\" one shocked man, who has often prayed here, told me, describing the attack as unimaginable. On Friday, the terror swiftly turned to fury when three of the gunmen were overpowered right outside the mosque. They were beaten and burnt to death.

The last episode of series two had been highly anticipated by viewers - especially after one of the show's stars said it will not be returning. The Daily Telegraph said the finale was \"a near perfect work of art\", while the Metro called it a \"masterpiece\". And on Twitter, viewers said they were left \"heartbroken\" that it had ended. The first series of BBC Three's Fleabag - broadcast in 2016 - was adapted from Phoebe Waller-Bridge's award-winning play. Waller-Bridge went on to win a Bafta and two Royal Television Society Awards for the show. It returned this year for series two, airing on BBC One as well, and has captivated viewers with the title character's tantalising relationship with a charismatic priest, played by Irish actor Andrew Scott. 'Emotionally satisfying' Serena Davies, head of culture at the Telegraph, said \"it would be hard to overstate what Waller-Bridge has done with Fleabag series two\". \"Her faultlessly paced tragic comedy, or rather her comic tragedy, is a near perfect work of art. It also rips up the rule book.\" She added: \"It is hard to think of anything so profound being so lightly told.\" Meanwhile, Metro reviewer Cydney Yeates called the ending \"emotionally satisfying\". \"Fleabag will be heralded triumphant for decades to come, not just for its dark comedy and novelty guinea pig cafe, but for its frank discussions surrounding sex and raw narratives surrounding grief and miscarriage,\" she added.

The boy joins rapper 2 Millly, actor Alfonso Ribeiro and floss dancer Backpack Kid in suing the Epic Games. Fortnite said it did not comment on ongoing litigation. The Random The Carlton and the Floss, both dances under dispute, have now been removed from Microsoft-owned game Forza Horizon 4. Players could previously choose for driver avatars to perform these dances when they appeared on screen. Other dance moves remain. Microsoft has not commented on the removal of the dances. The latest legal action against Fortnite was filed in California on behalf of a YouTuber known as Orange Shirt Boy, over a dance move named the Random. His mother complained Epic Games had not credited him or sought his consent to use, display or reproduce the dance. The boy performed it as part of a competition organised by Epic Games, in which gamers were asked to submit videos, with the winning dance going on to feature in Fortnite. Orange Shirt Boy did not win but players petitioned to have his dance included in the game, which Epic eventually did, although, unlike other dance moves for Fortnite avatars, it was never sold to players. The legal action makes no mention of the competition and tweets discussing it have now been deleted, according to Variety magazine. Originality test The cases against Fortnite raise interesting questions about whether a dance can be copyrighted and will be carefully watched by other games-makers keen to avoid similar legal action. Fortnite is free to download but makes money from selling add-ons such as cosmetic elements, known as skins, and dance moves, known as emotes. Courts deciding whether such moves are subject to copyright will look at a range of factors, including the level of creativity, the complexity or length of the dance and how it was created.

According to reports, Authentic Brands, the US owner of the Barneys department store, and JD Sports have tabled a joint offer, while online retailers Asos and Boohoo are also said to be interested. Administrators Deloitte have been looking for buyers for some or all of Arcadia, after a slump in sales caused by the pandemic triggered its collapse. Next, which has 550 UK shops and has weathered the pandemic well, was seen as a good fit to take over the group's assets. It had been bidding in partnership with the US hedge fund Davidson Kempner, which was going to put up most of the money. Next said it wished \"the administrator and future owners [of Arcadia] well in their endeavours to preserve an important part of the UK retail sector\". Retail pain Experts expect Arcadia to be broken up, with bidders taking on different parts of the business and brands potentially hived off from their stores. In December, Australian collective City Chic said it would buy Arcadia's Evans brand, commerce and wholesale business for \u00a323m but not its store network. Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost, up by almost a quarter on the previous year, as shops faced strict curbs and prolonged closures.\n\nSummary:","367":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Walliams, 46, will also feature as himself alongside Beano favourites such as the Bash Street Kids and characters from his World's Worst Children books. The Dundee-based comic celebrates its 80th birthday on 30 July. The city's McManus museum has been renamed the McMenace for a new exhibition celebrating the anniversary. Walliams has commissioned a BeanoTown adventure featuring characters Dennis and his pet dog Gnasher, Minnie the Minx, and superhero parody character Bananaman.

The Greens made big gains, while the centre-left SPD is set to remain the largest party. The far-right AfD lost ground but may just qualify for seats. The party is currently represented in all 16 German state legislatures and in some parts of the country polls in double digits. The vote comes days after a racist gunman killed nine people in shisha bars in the western city of Hanau. 'Bitter day' for CDU The result, if confirmed by final vote figures, will most likely lead to a continuation of the red-green coalition in the left-leaning northern port city. The Christian Democrats (CDU) have slipped into third place with little more than 11%. Party general secretary Paul Ziemiak said it was a \"bitter day\", and acknowledged that Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer's resignation announcement following a scandal in the eastern state of Thuringia had damaged the party. The CDU there caused consternation by voting with the AfD to elect a regional leader, a move Ms Merkel described as \"unforgiveable\" and against the CDU's values. The AfD has grown in popularity in recent years but has been condemned for its extreme views on immigration, freedom of speech and the press. Meanwhile Greens national co-leader Robert Habeck told German TV the party's performance was a great success. The preliminary results gave them 24.1%, almost twice as many votes as five years ago. \"We have a very challenging situation for democracy in Germany, and the CDU is tied up in its own problems... It will be up to us to give the land direction and trust,\" Mr Habeck said. The party may have benefited from the presence of climate activist Greta Thunberg, who joined thousands of people in a demonstration in the city on Friday. The Social Democrats (SPD) - Mrs Merkel's coalition partner at national level - received 39.1%, down about six percentage points from the 2015 election \n\nSummary:","369":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Ministers say there are no plans to relax the strict rules. Solicitors are reporting a \"massive rise\" in demand for wills from people worried about coronavirus. Failing to correctly sign a will in front of two independent witnesses, who are physically present, in England and Wales is likely to lead to a judge ruling the document, and any legacy in it, invalid. In Scotland, the regulations are less formal, and only require one witness. Call for law to be relaxed The law is strict on writing a will and ensuring it is valid in England and Wales. This includes signing it in front of two independent witnesses in person, and having two people signing it in your presence. The existing law dates from 1837, the start of Queen Victoria's reign, to protect individuals at a time of less efficient record keeping, lower levels of literacy, and less advanced technology. The witnessing rules have been tested by the lockdown, isolation, and social distancing requirements in place during the coronavirus outbreak - at a time when many people want to finalise a will at relatively short notice. This has led to people witnessing signatures over garden fences and standing in driveways, with solicitors often overseeing from a safe distance. The Law Society, the solicitors' trade body, has called on the Ministry of Justice to make changes to the law, such as allowing the careful use of video conferencing in the process. Ian Bond, who chairs the society's wills and equity committee, also called on the government to follow the Australian model, where the law is the same but where judges investigate and show some flexibility in allowing wills to stand. He said there were recommendations from the Law Commission in 2017 on modernising the law that could be used as a template.

The most recent disagreement began on Wednesday when Wildcat Haven released a video of a 'pure' wildcat which they said had been filmed near Huntly in Aberdeenshire. They suggested its purity had been verified by an independent expert at the National Museums of Scotland and that it was the first living wildcat to score full marks on an observation scale which determines its purity. The 21-point scale is a recognised measure of how much a wildcat has become hybridised with domestic cats. Rival group Scottish Wildcat Action (SWA) immediately sought to discredit the claim saying it was \"not news\" to them that a pure wildcat had been found and that the one in the video is \"extremely similar\" to one they have already identified. At this point it looked like both sides were in agreement that what had been filmed was actually a pure wildcat. But then on Thursday Scottish Wildcat Action released a second video which was captured in the same area in December. It now appeared to question whether the cat in both videos was actually a \"pure\" wildcat at all. Dr Andrew Kitchener from the National Museums of Scotland said: \"Wildcat Haven approached me to comment on [Wednesday's] video footage, which shows one cat in the wild. The animal displays a number of characteristics of the Scottish wildcat, however not all of the characteristics which are used to identify the Scottish wildcat are visible in the video. \"While the cat in this video shows a high number of characteristics of the Scottish wildcat, there is not yet sufficient evidence to fully determine its purity.\" So why the apparent shift in position from Scottish Wildcat Action? It would appear to stem from the implied criticism that SWA is involved in a project to breed and then release wildcats which contain a small degree of hybridisation with domestic cats.

If you like a bit of nostalgia in your games then the remake of Resident Evil 2 and the new Mortal Kombat could be the ones for you. For fans wanting something new, games like Anthem and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice are worth considering.

Ms Dorries will be the first sitting MP to appear on the show, which could see her being away from her job in the Commons for up to a month. The chief whip will meet her when she returns from Australia, when she will be expected to explain herself. The Conservative Party is concerned about Ms Dorries' inability to do parliamentary and constituency business while she is taking part in the programme. Ms Dorries said she wanted to use her appearance on the reality show to raise awareness of issues she is interested in, such as reducing the time limit on abortions from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. 'Heated debates' \"I'm doing the show because 16 million people watch it.

There are certain causes that I'm interested in, one of which is '20 Weeks'. \"I will be talking about this issue around the campfire.

In Brussels on Wednesday the EU foreign policy chief, Baroness Ashton, urged Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov to release political detainees and stop the harassment of opposition activists. Belarus opposition leader Alexander Milinkevich has called for a dual approach, focused on isolating President Alexander Lukashenko whilst making it easier for ordinary Belarusians to travel to, study and work in, the EU. Poland and Lithuania have already dropped visa fees for Belarusian citizens. The other EU member states continue to impose a levy considerably higher than that paid by Russians or Ukrainians - Belarusians pay 60 euros (\u00a350), the others, 35. In addition to the condemnation of the Belarusian authorities from individual member states, there appears to be a consensus across the EU that sanctions against Belarus must be reimposed and strengthened. Mounting pressure EU governments are considering whether to reimpose a travel ban on Mr Lukashenko and his top aides. The foreign ministers of the Netherlands, the UK, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Poland have all called for clear signals to be sent to Minsk. Comments from EU diplomats suggest up to 100 names are being studied. Visa sanctions were initially imposed by the EU in 2006, but suspended in 2008 amid signs of a political thaw in Belarus. The only voice of \"dissent\" has been Italy, which has usually insisted that dialogue with Minsk is the only way to bring about political change in the country. The EU could also look at restrictions on the fees paid - especially by Germany - for Belarusian oil products; and freezing Belarusian official assets in the EU.

Belarus's foreign policy is generally oriented towards Russia, some other ex-Soviet republics and parts of the developing world. \n\nSummary:","378":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

It said a a number of measures were being implemented in the final quarter of the financial year and the internal report said it had drawn up an action plan to tackle the debt. It said based on December information, the forecast outturn for the year ending in March was likely to be an \u00a318.5m deficit. Monitor's main concerns in September 2012 were that the trust was struggling to meet Private Finance Initiative (PFI) repayments for King's Mill Hospital and that the hospital was being underused. The trust had signed for the period 2005-2043 for a total cost of \u00a3976m to pay for a revamp. Figures released in 2012 showed the cost of the PFI deal had risen to \u00a32.05bn.

Junichiro Hironaka also said that Tokyo prosecutors had confiscated the passport and mobile phone of Carlos Ghosn's wife, Reuters reported. Mr Ghosn, who denies any wrongdoing, was recently released on bail after 108 days in custody. Tokyo prosecutors entered Mr Ghosn's residence before 06:00 local time on Thursday (21:00 GMT Wednesday) and took him to their office on suspicion he had misappropriated Nissan funds for personal use, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported. Mr Ghosn's lawyer said it was almost unheard of to arrest someone after being released on bail. \"I am innocent of the groundless charges and accusations against me,\" Mr Ghosn said in a statement released by his representatives. He said the arrest was \"part of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors\". \"Why arrest me except to try to break me?

Mr Ghosn was the architect of the alliance between Nissan and French carmaker Renault, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016.

Seen as an economic reformer, Mr Chang handled talks with Pyongyang's only major ally, China. The KCNA state news agency said the decision was announced after a meeting of the ruling communist Korean Workers' Party Politburo over the weekend. News of his dismissal filtered out in South Korea last week along with reports that two of his close aides had been executed for corruption. It is unclear when these latest images date from. 'Dissolute' life The KCNA report accuses Mr Chang of being part of a faction working against the North Korean state. \"Chang pretended to uphold the party and leader but was engrossed in such factional acts as dreaming different dreams and involving himself in double-dealing behind the scenes.\" It accused him of offences such as financial mismanagement and selling off national resources for his personal gain, but it also denounced him for leading what it called \"a dissolute and depraved life\". \"Ideologically sick and extremely idle and easy-going, he used drugs and squandered foreign currency at casinos while he was receiving medical treatment in a foreign country under the care of the party,\" the KCNA report said.

Renewables will need to provide 27% of EU energy by 2030, but while the target will be binding at EU level there will be no mandatory targets for member states. The policy proposals are subject to review by heads of government. Green groups have said the new targets lack ambition and the 40% emissions cut is \"dangerously low\". This wide ranging White Paper will have a significant impact on the way Europe generates its power from 2020 onwards. The Commission wants to give clarity to investors in renewable energy while at the same time maintaining their leadership role in global climate negotiations. A critical part of that is the headline figure on emissions cuts. The target that was set for 2020 was 20% but the EU as a group had almost reached the goal by 2012. Some countries including the UK urged the Commission to propose a bigger target of 50% by 2030, others held out for 35%. Climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard said that, given the economic climate, the 40% target was a significant advance. \"A 40% emissions reduction is the most cost-effective target for the EU and it takes account of our global responsibility,\" she said. \"If all other regions were equally ambitious about tackling climate change, the world would be in significantly better shape.\" Officials emphasised that the 40% target would have to be achieved \"through domestic measures alone\", meaning that member states couldn't offset their reductions by paying for carbon cutting in other countries. Binding targets The move was welcomed by investors. According to the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, who's members manage 7.5 trillion euros, the new target was a good first step. \"A 40% emissions reduction target is the minimum necessary to keep Europe on course for a low-carbon economy as outlined in the EU's 2050 Roadmap,\" said chief executive Stephan\n\nSummary:","385":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The president of the Bambino Gesu hospital in Rome had asked British doctors if 10-month-old Charlie could be transferred to his care. It comes after the Pope tweeted his support for Charlie on Monday. Charlie has been receiving specialist treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October. Mr Johnson has told his Italian counterpart it is \"right that decisions continued to be led by expert medical opinion, supported by the courts\", in line with Charlie's \"best interests.\" Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes progressive muscle weakness. Doctors say he cannot see, hear, move, cry or swallow. During questions to the prime minister, on Wednesday, Theresa May said she was \"confident\" Great Ormond Street Hospital \"have, and always will, consider any offers or new information that has come forward with consideration of the well-being of a desperately ill child\".

Evans built his reputation as a witty prankster on London station GLR, where he started as a producer and ended up as a star DJ. He shot to fame in 1992 as host of The Big Breakfast, a riotous early morning programme on Channel 4. The Big Breakfast was a huge hit in its early days, beating even GMTV when it launched on ITV in 1993. The Warrington-born star's dynamic personality defined the show, which catapulted him from cult personality to national celebrity. Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, his first prime-time TV show, made its debut on Channel 4 in 1994. The format for the show - made by Ginger Productions, his own production outfit - was lucratively sold around the world. After leaving The Big Breakfast in 1994, Evans was recruited by BBC Radio 1 to revamp the station's breakfast show. He accepted on the proviso it would be in the hands of Ginger Productions, an arrangement the BBC was prepared to accept in return for bumper ratings. In 1996 he returned to Channel 4 to launch TFI Friday, a classic Evans cocktail of live music, celebrity chat, outlandish stunts and in-jokes. Yet he found it hard to juggle it with his Radio 1 day job, leading to a parting of the ways in January 1997 when his demands to work a four-day week were refused. \"I was stupid, no doubt about that,\" he admitted in 2009. \"I was ungrateful. I had this brilliant career and messed it up.\" Evans was not off air for long. Later that year he returned to breakfast radio, on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin station. He liked the job so much he bought Virgin Radio from Sir Richard at the end of 1997. But the Evans magic started to fade soon afterwards. He was photographed out on the town with Paul Gascoigne, damaging the footballer's chances of getting into the England squad for the 1998 World Cup.

Milne, 42, from Helland near Bodmin in Cornwall, admitted wilfully killing 28 badgers and possessing 37. He also admitted failing to store firearms securely. He was given an 18-week suspended sentence at Bodmin Magistrates' Court. Police raided Milne's home and business addresses in July. At his home they found a freezer in an outbuilding containing eight badger carcasses. Vet's examination They found several shotguns and rifles along with ammunition in two cars. At a unit on an industrial estate in Roche they found a number of freezer units containing 29 badgers.A vet examined all of the dead animals and found 28 had injuries consistent with being shot. Milne had a licence for badger culling issued by Natural England, but these animals had been killed outside of the cull period. He told police he intended to submit them for payment when the cull period re-opened. His licence has since been suspended. 'Bad decision' Badger culling areas were introduced by Natural England as part of government efforts to control tuberculosis in cattle. Michael Green, defending, said this was \"an unusual case\" and his client \"was taking a chance and clearly made a bad decision\". Milne previously worked as an engineer but gave that up to set up a field sports company in 2009, for which he obtained firearms certificates. The court heard a number of farmers had provided positive references in relation to his character and the pest control service he provided. He was also ordered to carry 150 hours of unpaid work and a deprivation order was issued for the guns, ammunition and carcasses.\n\nSummary:","395":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

But China has been showing a very different face to countries closer to home in an increasingly tense confrontation over rival claims to the resource-rich waters of the South China Sea. It is a region where the peaceful nature of China's rise is starting to be questioned as it pushes a long-standing maritime claim that stretches deep into South East Asia. \"China is becoming much more confident in the region and there are signs it is becoming giddy with success. It has become much more influential much more quickly than it expected,\" says Dr Kerry Brown of the Asia Programme at Chatham House in London. Vietnam and the Philippines in recent months have seen the snarl of a resurgent regional power that is fast losing patience with the gripes of smaller neighbours over maritime borders. \"If these countries do not want to change their ways with China, they will need to prepare for the sound of cannons. It may be the only way for the dispute in the sea to be resolved,\" said the state run newspaper, the Global Times, in a recent editorial. Hard power Chinese officials have been more restrained in their comments, but foreign ministry spokesmen have issued a series of warnings about what they see as encroachments into Chinese waters. Beijing says it does want a peaceful solution. But Vietnam and the Philippines say Chinese ships have stepped up harassment of vessels involved in oil exploration and fishing. \"The growth of Chinese military spending is beginning to translate into hard power,\" says John Hemmings, an analyst at the Royal United Services Institute. \"This is the first major sign that a more confident Chinese grand strategy is emerging.

Those exchanges are dominated by energy firms who fear oil will fall further from its current 12-year low of $29 when Iran resumes oil exports. Iran has said it will sell up to 500,000 extra barrels of crude oil. Economic sanctions, in place for nearly 40 years, were lifted after inspectors confirmed on Saturday that Iran had taken the required steps to limit its nuclear programme. What Iran deal means for world markets Iran sanctions deal in 60 seconds Will Tehran now get a McDonald's? Investors reacted immediately in the first day of trading in the Muslim week. The Saudi Tadawul All Share Index, the largest market in the region, dropped during trading to its lowest level since early 2011, closing at 5,520 points. Share prices in all six of the other Gulf stock exchanges also dropped, as investors weighed up a stronger Iranian economy and extra oil in an already over-supplied market. Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi said it would take \"some time\" to restore stability to the global oil market, but added that he remained optimistic. Analysis: Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent It's a bit surprising that markets are surprised - Iran has promised since the Vienna agreement was signed in July to pump 500,000 additional barrels of crude per day when sanctions were lifted.

In fact, the Tadawul All Share Index in Riyadh has halved since the summer of 2014 when oil prices started their precipitous fall from $115 to $29 per barrel.

And yet it was once considered so unnecessary that it was included in the book of 101 Un-Useless Japanese Inventions - along with dust slippers for cats and the hydrophobe's bath body suit (for taking a bath without getting wet). Un-useless inventions, also known as chindogu, are the brainchild of Kenji Kawakami, who defines them as things that are almost completely useless, but not quite. \"If you invent something which turns out to be so handy that you use it all the time, then you have failed to make a chindogu. Try the Patent Office,\" says the website chindogu.com. An early selfie stick, perhaps the first, was invented in the 1980s by Hiroshi Ueda. At the time he worked for the Minolta camera company, and was a keen photographer. \"Whenever I went overseas I took my camera with me and took loads of photos,\" he says. But while travelling in Europe he encountered a problem. He was keen to get pictures of himself and his wife together - but passers-by couldn't always be trusted. \"When I was in the Louvre Museum in Paris, I asked a child to take a photo of us, but when I stepped away, the child ran away with my camera,\" he says. It was a problem crying out for a solution - and as an engineer in Minolta's development department, Ueda was well-placed to find one. He came up with the \"extender stick\" - an extendable stick with a tripod screw that was designed for use with a new, small, camera. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. \"The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked,\" says Ueda. The concept encountered some resistance - Minolta's testing department found that women in particular were \n\nSummary:","405":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Officers searching his luxury ranch seized 17 paintings believed to be by famous artists such as Joan Miro, Fernando Botero and Leonora Carrington. Police continue to search for Mr Duarte, who has been charged with organised crime and money laundering. Mr Duarte denied the accusations made against him before his disappearance but has not spoken out since. Veracruz Governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares, who took over as governor last week, said the works of art seized on Sunday would be auctioned off. The proceeds would be used to finance a children's hospital, he said. Luxury retreat Mr Yunes alleged that the property had been furnished using money siphoned off from public funds. \"More than 200m pesos ($9.7m; \u00a37.6m) stolen from the people of Veracruz were spent doing up this house so that Duarte could have people over, now he won't host anything any more,\" he said. Officials said the paintings would still have to be verified by experts but they believe they are dealing with works by Mexican painters David Alfaro Siqueiros and Rufino Tamayo, Spanish artist Joan Miro and English-born Mexican painter Leonora Carrington. Officers also found a sculpture by Mexican artist Javier Marin and copies of historic documents such as Mexico's Declaration of Independence. They said the combined value of the works of art seized would still have to be determined. They had been stored in a cellar in Mr Duarte's weekend retreat. The ranch has 25 rooms, a helicopter landing pad, two tennis courts and extensive grounds just outside the city of Cordoba, in north-eastern Veracruz.\n\nSummary:","406":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

That has also led tour operator Thomas Cook to introduce a new fuel surcharge to the cost of its holidays. For short-haul flights the extra levy is \u00a315 per holiday, rising to \u00a340 for long-haul. 'Hitting budgets' The average price of petrol has risen by nearly 6 pence per litre since the end of last year. It has increased due to rises in VAT, fuel duty and the wholesale price of oil. Experian Catalist said the price of unleaded petrol had risen sharply over the last few days, increasing by 0.8 pence since Thursday. The average price of diesel has also risen, and is now at 135.44p per litre. The RAC Foundation, which also monitors prices, predicted that the price of unleaded petrol would continue to rise for some time. \"It would be no surprise if prices increase by another 8p a litre in the near future,\" said RAC motoring strategist, Adrian Tink. \"This kind of rise will seriously impact on people's car use, many of whom having no other option but to travel by car. \"These escalating prices are hitting family budgets hard at a difficult economic time,\" he added. The RAC called on the government to scrap a planned 1p per litre rise in fuel duty, due to take effect in April. Chancellor George Osborne indicated recently that the government was considering cancelling it. Flying high Thomas Cook's new surcharge will apply to all bookings that include a Thomas Cook flight made from Tuesday onwards. The company blames a 40% increase in the cost of fuel for the move. The surcharge applies to both flight-only or package holidays, and applies whether the trip is booked through a travel agency or directly with Thomas Cook itself. Surcharges will apply to all charter brands including Thomas Cook, Airtours, Sunset, Manos, Club 18-30 and Neilson. A spokesman for the company, Ian Ailles, said: \"We've worked hard to keep the impact of the rising fuel costs on our holidaymakers to a min\n\nSummary:","407":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The ban has come after the Food Standards Agency (FSA) downgraded shellfish flesh samples in Ruan Creek and King Harry Reach from Grade B to C. Two wet winters have resulted in sewage washing into the area's waterways, leading to pollution concerns. The Truro Port Health Authority said it was monitoring the situation closely. 'Enormous demand' A Grade C rating means it is unlawful to harvest the mussels as there may be a risk to human health, even after the cleaning process. Mark Mercer, from the Duchy Oyster Farm, said: \"We're now at a point where we were about to harvest 40 tonnes a year. That is now impossible. \"We're applying to have an official relay site on the Helford [River], but we have got a potential downgrade for mussels on the Helford as well. \"If that goes ahead, the stock will go to waste. The lead on could result in lost jobs.\" The effects would be felt as far as London where there is \"enormous demand,\" he added. The FSA said: \"EU regulations stipulate mussels are harvested from areas that meet relevant health standards. \"If levels of contamination exceed the required criteria the FSA will take action to protect public health.\" Gary Cooper, from the Truro Port Health Authority, said: \"We are monitoring the situation closely. We want to facilitate business but at the same time we have to ensure that adequate protection for public health is in place.\" Mr Cooper said the ban would be in place for at least 12 months.\n\nSummary:","408":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Youngsters from the estate's Big Noise orchestra will take to the stage to perform with the Venezuelan musicians. Dudamel has been described as one of the most \"exciting\" conductors in the world. His own musical education began in El Sistema, which has taught music to hundreds of thousands of poor Venezuelan youngsters over the past 37 years. It has a philosophy of social transformation through music education, seeking to keep children away from a life of disaffection and crime. The only UK version of El Sistema, Sistema Scotland, was set-up in 2008 in the Raploch estate. There are now 450 children taking part, from a community which numbers just 3,000. Dudamel said it was a huge pleasure to play for the community in Raploch. He said: \"To see how this programme, which was I think the first outside Venezuela, has grown is beautiful. It is a huge honour to be part of this moment.\" The 'Bolivars', as the Venezuelans are commonly known, arrived in Stirling ahead of four days of workshops and the midsummer night concert in front of 8,000 people on Thursday.

Baroness Gillian Shephard, former cabinet minister and Conservative MP for South West Norfolk, said she had \"happy memories\" of Mr Powley. \"He was tremendously hard-working and very straight-speaking,\" she said. \"He was a very effective MP - committed to fighting for the best for the people of Norwich and very supportive of a huge number of causes.\" Remembering Mr Powley's success in winning Norwich South seat from Labour, she said: \"It was considered a great triumph.\" 'Great impact' Labour won the seat back in 1987, and has held it ever since apart from 2010-15, when it went to the Liberal Democrats.

The statue is to be unveiled at a private event by descendants of some of the soldiers, at Queen Mary's Hospital in Sidcup, Kent, where many of the men were treated. Ms Grigsby has researched the soldiers with \"broken faces\", whose uncomfortable memory she says has been neglected in war commemorations. Mirrors banned Her postgraduate research at Goldsmiths, University of London, found that many soldiers who returned, with their faces changed by shell and shrapnel injuries, faced social rejection and isolation. \"I came across stories of mirrors being banned from hospital wards, children cowering from their fathers who came home from the front with a new face, and sweethearts who couldn't bear to look at their lovers,\" she says. With today's awareness of mental health problems, Ms Grigsby says their post-war experiences must have been deeply traumatic. The homecoming for these disfigured young men could involve a complete loss of status, broken relationships and being turned away from jobs. She researched one soldier who was rejected by his wife - \"she couldn't bear to look at him\" - and was not allowed to serve customers in his old job as a tailor. But in a twist in the tale, he ended up marrying his wife's sister. It wasn't only about appearances. Some soldiers who had injuries to their jaws and mouths struggled to eat for the rest of their lives. Buried in a mask In some cases, where parts of the face were missing or irretrievably mutilated, men wore metal masks. These tin masks were painted and had artificial moustaches and eyebrows to reflect how the soldier once looked, based on photos from before the war. Ms Grigsby says some disfigured soldiers wore these masks all the time, at home as well as in public, never showing their injuries.\n\nSummary:","414":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

One Indian daily says world leaders must not allow political disputes to undermine their efforts to overcome the global economic crisis. Putin defended In Russia, state media and pro-Kremlin commentators appear to be downplaying what some observers see as the cool reception given to President Vladimir Putin by other world leaders. Most TV channels this morning are focusing on Mr Putin's interview with Germany's ARD channel and a gas explosion in Moscow, seemingly steering clear of suggestions that Mr Putin left Brisbane earlier than planned, reportedly to avoid further snubs. The English-language RT, however, did say that \"Putin may have had a lukewarm reception\" but added that \"he certainly stuck to his guns\". On Sunday, TV channels briefly reported on Mr Putin's early departure and quoted his own explanation that he needed sleep. The RBK liberal daily quotes international relations expert Andrey Sushentso saying Mr Putin gave a \"reasonable\" explanation for his early departure and the Western media's reaction is \"of secondary importance\". But in the same paper, Alexei Makarkin is quoted as warning that Russia is being \"increasingly isolated\", adding that \"BRICS nations won't quarrel publicly with the US for Russia's sake\". The isolation theme is picked up in Germany where a commentator in the widely-read Bild newspaper, warns that Russia must not be left in the cold. \"Putin has written off the West.

Five councils are calling on Welsh ministers to change advice so second-home owners who pay business rates rather than council tax cannot claim. The Welsh Government said councils can ask for more evidence from claimants. Properties that are used as full-time holiday accommodation are often registered as businesses. But a rising number of second-home owners have moved from paying council tax - which includes a second-home premium - to paying business rates. In Wales, a second-home owner can register to pay business rates if the property is available to be let for at least 140 days a year and is actually let for a minimum of 70 days. And after making the transition, they may be eligible for a discount from the Welsh Government, including a 100% discount if the rateable value is less than \u00a36,000. One councillor has claimed owners of \"around 250\" second homes in Powys have moved to paying business rates in this way, and that Powys council is in the process of issuing grant payments. \"They don't pay any business rates in Powys and yet they are able to benefit from the \u00a310,000 grant,\" said councillor Elwyn Vaughan, who represents a ward in the Dyfi Valley. \"It could mean around \u00a32.5m paid out to these holiday homes which is a stark raving bonkers situation. \"The money should be there for genuine, small businesses of which Powys has a wide range of companies like that which should be benefiting from these grants.\" Local authorities are responsible for assessing claims for the small business grants and distributing the money.

Welsh Government guidance does not set limits on numbers but insists attendees stay 2m (6ft 6ins) apart. Mrs Barrett said the arbitrary nature of limits set by individual crematoria and the restrictions imposed by the crisis - preventing mourners from comforting and supporting one another in traditional ways - was exacerbating bereaved families' distress. The current situation had created a \"mishmash of different approaches to the funeral process\", she explained. \"Some crematoria around the UK have stopped attendances at funerals, so you just have a direct cremation with no-one there,\" Mrs Barrett said. She said government guidelines state \"immediate family can attend a funeral, up to a certain number\", which had led to more questions. \"But who's immediate family? I've dealt with families with 10 siblings, 25 grandchildren, and I've heard of families now who are having to decide which members of their family can go and it's really, really distressing.\" She called on both UK and Welsh governments to \"look seriously at non-attendance funerals, if only for a few weeks\". Mrs Barrett, who stopped conducting services in early March when concern about the virus began to grow, urged bereaved families to \"focus on the future\" and organise memorial services once the outbreak has subsided. Funeral director Dean Thomas, from Caerphilly, echoed these concerns. \"The problem at the moment is that the guidance is changing frequently and different councils are interpreting it differently, so families are having to decide how many people can attend a funeral, who can and can't attend, at a very difficult time for them,\" said Mr Thomas, owner of Caerphilly Funeral Services. Mr Thomas called for a \"common sense\" approach, allowing families the flexibility to decide for thems\n\nSummary:","422":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

They found that the average risk was 18%, not 3-10% as estimated before. An autism charity says genetics only play a part in the disorder. Autism is a complex disorder which affects a child's ability to think, communicate, interact and learn. The study involved infants from 20 different places across the US and Canada, who were six to eight months old at the start of the research. They all had older siblings with autism. The researchers, from the Mind Institute in California, followed the children's development up to the age of three years, when they tested for autism. Of the 664 participants, a total of 132 children were found to meet the criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder. Of these, 54 received a diagnosis of autistic disorder and 78 were considered to have a milder form of autism. All the children were tested using an autism diagnostic tool, which measures non-verbal cognitive, language and motor skills. Among the study participants, 26.2% of male infants compared to 9% of female infants were diagnosed with a form of autism. Previous studies have shown that autism is more common in males than females - 80% of all affected children are male. In families with more than one older sibling with autism in the study, the average risk was 32%. Unknown factors Prof Sally Ozonoff, lead study author and professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the Mind Institute, University of California, explained the higher average risk figures in her study. \"Previous studies used different diagnostic criteria. This is the largest study of the siblings of children with autism ever conducted, the first to follow families up to the time of diagnosis as opposed to looking back once they have been diagnosed.\" But she was careful to emphasis that the figures were estimates averaged across all of the families. \"So for some families the risk will be greater th\n\nSummary:","427":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

So she decided she wanted to make a book to help other children understand she was just like them, and let teachers know it was okay to talk about it. Now she wants to help children of all disabilities to be able to explain their conditions in a similar way. \"It was stuff like pictures about different disabilities, information about how my limbs are affected and how autistic people's minds work differently,\" said Elan, who told BBC Radio Cymru she wants to compete in Paralympics. \"They found it quite interesting and did have a few questions about physical stuff.\" While Elan had a positive experience at her mainstream school, Ysgol Bro Dyfrdwy, her mother said this was not the case for all disabled pupils in Wales. \"Things have been very natural for Elan in school and we would like every school in Wales to be like that in the way they have supported us really,\" she said. \"Now that's not the case everywhere in Wales, and especially with hidden disabilities it is a lot more difficult.\" Ms Williams called for a more open and honest discussion when it comes to disability and wants to see the book used as a starting point to help people understand better. \"Elan is quite proactive about her disability and will often tell people about it before they have asked,\" she added. \"In places like America and maybe other places in the UK, they come along with a booklet about themselves explaini\n\nSummary:","428":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Two-thirds of the patients given the drugs were women, with use peaking in the 50-54 age group. The figures indicated antidepressant use was associated with deprivation. They recorded 225,969 patients in the poorest parts of Scotland receiving the drugs, compared with 110,507 in the least deprived areas. The total cost of antidepressants to the NHS in Scotland was \u00a340.8m. The use of lower-cost drugs means this figure has fallen by one-third over the past 10 years. 'Extremely alarming' The figures were described as \"extremely alarming\" by Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw. He said: \"Years ago the SNP pledged to stop this rise, yet it hasn't even been able to make a dent in it. \"We are now looking at the flabbergasting statistic of more than one in seven people in Scotland being prescribed antidepressants this year. \"There's no doubt these drugs have a place in addressing mental health issues. But we urgently have to look at better alternatives than simply parking people on medication in the hope things don't get any worse, with no aspiration for complete recovery.\" Liberal Democrat health spokesman Jim Hume also voiced his concern. \"The fact that we have seen such substantial increases in prescriptions raises real concerns over whether this reflects shortages in other services,\" he said. \"We need to ensure that doctors across Scotland are able to refer patients to the services that offer them the best chance of recovery. If doctors are prescribing anti-depressants because they feel they have no other option then this is a real problem. \"These figures should raise a red flag for SNP ministers.

Last Wednesday they hunkered down in secure rooms, seeking refuge from an invasion of Congress in which five people died. Some Republicans were not wearing masks during the ordeal, footage suggests. Video shared by Punchbowl News shows several lawmakers apparently refusing facemasks offered to them. However, CBS pictures from inside the chamber show Ms Jayapal was herself not wearing a mask at one point. Medical experts fear more lawmakers may have contracted the disease, potentially amounting to a super-spreader event at a time when coronavirus infections and deaths continue to rise in the US. The US has recorded the highest number of coronavirus infections (22.6 million) and deaths (367,000) in the world, with no sign of the epidemic abating, despite the limited roll-out of vaccines. Over the weekend, top congressional doctor Brian Monahan told lawmakers and congressional staff who sheltered together from the riots to get tested. \"The time in this room was several hours for some and briefer for others,\" Mr Monahan said. \"During this time, individuals may have been exposed to another occupant with coronavirus infection.\" Mr Monahan did not say how many lawmakers were in the room, but called on them to observe social-distancing measures and wear masks. New Jersey Democratic Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman was the first lawmaker to confirm she had tested positive on Monday. In a tweet, the 75-year-old cancer survivor said she was resting at home with \"mild, cold-like symptoms\".

Neither deaths were initially deemed as suspicious by Sussex Police. Ms Nicholson's parents are challenging the senior West Sussex coroner over the scope of a new inquest. Trigg, 54, was jailed for life in 2017 for the murder of Ms Nicholson and manslaughter of Ms Devlin at their homes in Worthing, West Sussex. Following the conviction, the High Court quashed the findings of accidental death in the original inquest into Ms Nicholson's death and ordered a new one. The senior coroner for West Sussex ruled it would be a short inquest, with no witnesses questioned. Her parents, Elizabeth and Peter Skelton, want the new inquest to investigate if police failed to adequately protect their daughter. They argue that there should be a full inquest under Article Two - the right to life - of the Human Rights Act, which can scrutinise the role of public bodies in a person's death. Mr Skelton said before the hearing: \"I see this hearing as an opportunity to make sure that there is a proper inquiry into whether Susan's death could have been prevented.\" In a written submission to the High Court, Heather Williams QC said the coroner's decision was unlawful as it was \"plainly arguable\" that Sussex Police had breached its duties to protect Ms Nicholson and to effectively investigate the death Ms Devlin. Officers had been called to Ms Nicholson's flat six times in the weeks before her death over reports of violence, and one of his former partners was taken to hospital after he attacked her. But the force did not find the similarities between the cases suspicious and treated Trigg as a bereaved partner rather than a suspect. At least two police officers were involved in the investigations into both women's deaths and were aware of his connection to the cases.

It is evidence that protective measures introduced in recent years are working, the Bat Conservation Trust says. However, the group cautions that the status of all populations needs to be viewed in the context of major declines that occurred during the 20th Century. \"There has been so much conservation action in recent years, along with legislation, that we would have hoped to see some sort of positive response,\" said Phil Briggs, the trust's monitoring manager. \"It's thought that bats have not yet recovered to their historic levels but it's good to see some bats going in the right direction,\" he told BBC News. The latest State of UK's Bats report was compiled with the help of more than 1,200 citizen scientists. These volunteers have been out across the nation counting the animals using detectors that pick up their ultrasonic chatter. The echolocation sounds not only announce the bats' presence but can also be used to distinguish the different species. Those doing particularly well include the greater and lesser horseshoe bats; those apparently not doing quite so well include the brown long-eared bat and the serotine bat. But the figures carried some caveats, said Mr Briggs. Natural year-on-year variability has to be accounted for, and for some species - such as the Leisler's bat and the Nathusius' pipistrelle - there is simply insufficient data on which to make a definitive statement. It is the case, too, that some animals are harder to count because of their behaviour, and this may underplay their true status. \"Some of the woodland species, for example, have quiet calls so they're more difficult to pick up on bat detectors, and they can be hard to tell apart because their calls are quite similar,\" Mr Briggs explained. \"Sometimes the only way you can tell the difference is when experienced volunteers trap the bats and examine them.\" The Bechstein\u2019s and ba\n\nSummary:","435":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

The day before her death Ms Flack had found out she would be prosecuted and feared press intrusion, the inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court heard. Coroner Mary Hassell ruled her death was suicide. Ms Hassell said Ms Flack, 40, had killed herself after an \"exacerbation and fluctuation\" of ill health and distress. The inquest heard sections of the media had been \"hounding\" the presenter over the alleged assault of Lewis Burton, which she denied. Ms Flack's mental health had deteriorated following her arrest, according to the coroner. The inquest heard the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially pursued a caution against Ms Flack, but withdrew it after the Metropolitan Police said it believed it was in the public interest to bring an assault charge. The presenter's mother Chris told the court she thought her daughter had been \"seriously let down by the authorities and in particular the CPS for pursuing the case\". Ms Hassell said she was \"satisfied [Ms Flack] wanted to cause her own death\" and \"there's no doubt in my mind at all\". \"For some, it seems she had a charmed life - but the more famous she got the more mentally distressed she became,\" she said. \"Her trauma was played out in the national press and that was incredibly distressing for her.\" A pathologist ruled Ms Flack died from hanging.

It took part in a pilot scheme launched by the Home Office in 1996 to upgrade the Dorchester Division Headquarters site and its associated specialist services.\n\nSummary:","442":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Just as the app economy has enabled many people to customise their smartphones, new products like the Pi make it possible for inventors and developers to create their own hardware. Eben Upton and Peter Lomas are the co-creators of the Pi and now work with the not-for-profit organisation - the Raspberry Pi Foundation - that markets it. Here they give their feedback on some of the ideas. Eben Upton says: \"When we first started developing the Pi, we never imagined the range of applications that people would find for it, and how willing people would be to share their ideas and detailed designs with the community. \"Although it's the Model B that gets most attention from software developers, what's interesting is how many of the hardware projects described here are best suited to the cheaper and lower-power Model A version.\" A 'carputer' Glenn Walsh of Carrickfergus says: \"I want to use my Pi as the basis of a carputer (car computer) in a 1980s Toyota sports car. I have already built my own 7in touchscreen which should work with the Pi as I've tested it on a PC running Fedora. \"The interface to the engine sensors is my own design based on a PIC microcontroller and it will communicate with the Pi via USB. \"I'm looking to write the software in Gambas which is a Visual Basic-type language for Linux. I have some of this written already.\" \"Gerits\" from the Raspberry Pi forums has a similar idea. He writes: \"I'm trying to create an in-car entertainment system.

The actual number of incidents is likely to be higher, as more serious attacks are not included. The figures were revealed in a letter to Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Liam Kerr. He said protection of emergency service workers had to be \"paramount\". Common assaults on emergency service workers have risen by nearly 100 since 2015\/16 when 6,414 were recorded. However, this was a drop on the previous year when 6,480 were recorded. Mr Kerr said: \"It's extremely worrying that the number of attacks recorded by police on emergency service workers has risen to a three-year high. \"We have to get tough on those who commit these offences to make it absolutely clear it will not be tolerated. \"Many of these attacks will have occurred when a police officer, paramedic or firefighter has arrived specifically to help the very people who end up assaulting them.\" His comment comes a day after a firefighter was treated in hospital following the crew coming \"under attack\" when attending a bin fire in Glasgow. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service assistant chief officer Lewis Ramsay said such attacks \"beggar belief\". A Scottish government spokesman said: \"The Emergency Workers Act includes a penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment, a \u00a310,000 fine, or both and we have extended the act to include GPs and doctors, nurses and midwives working in the community. \"For more serious attacks other offences can be used with maximum penalties all the way up to life imprisonment. \"All workers deserve protection from abuse and violence at work. \"That is why Scotland's justice system provides for protection for all workers under our common laws of assault, threatening and abusive behaviour and breach of the peace.\"\n\nSummary:","444":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Chief of the Air Staff Sir Stephen Dalton attended the retirement ceremony and there was also a parade. Three new Rivet-Joint aircraft will replace the R1 in 2014. Until then, the RAF is sharing - or \"co-manning\" - planes owned by the US Air Force. 51 Squadron operated the RAF's two Nimrod R1s, with the aircraft using a team of 24 reconnaissance equipment operators, four flight crew and a mission supervisor. It was typically used to try to intercept communications, such as mobile phone conversations, while flying over enemy territory. 'Lifesaver' The R1 operated for 37 years and served throughout the Cold War, as well as in the Balkans, Afghanistan and in the current conflict in Libya. Speaking at the event, Air Chief Marshal Dalton said that it was a \"day of celebration\" for all that the Nimrod had achieved. \"There is no question this aircraft has given us the ability to do things that would be very much more difficult - and could have cost us more lives if we hadn't had it,\" he said. The RAF's top officer also alluded to concerns about relying, temporarily, on the use of American planes for UK airborne intelligence. He admitted it was a blow, but said the air force could still manage: \"It doesn't leave a hole - it dents the depth of our capabilities. \"We can still do the missions we need to do, but this was a more efficient way of doing things. We'll have to use other methods now.\" Flight Lieutenant Dave McRitchie, an R1 mission commander, also paid tribute to the aircraft's vital role during its years of service. \"It's something that's played a major part in every operation that UK armed forces have been involved in - now it won't be there.\" The MR2 version of the Nimrod finished service in 2010, while its replacement the MRA4 was scrapped in the defence review.

Developmental problems have led to autism and communication difficulties. \"He needs 24-hour-a-day supervision,\" his mother says. \"Tristram can't cross a road by himself.\" Christine, who lives near Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, said she loved the young man her son had become but felt sad about the challenges he faced. \"I did feel angry when I realised they had known about the problems of the medication when I was prescribed it,\" she said. Problems with sodium valproate, commonly known by the brand names Epilim, Episenta and Depakote, were first identified in the 1970s but restrictions were only placed on its use two years ago. Drug regulator the MHRA said up to four in 10 babies were at risk of developmental disorders if sodium valproate was taken during pregnancy and one in 10 was at risk of birth defects. All of the 17,000 women of child-bearing age prescribed sodium valproate each year in the UK should be on a pregnancy-prevention programme to ensure they are aware of the risks but campaigners and charities said this was often not the case. In July this year, Baroness Cumberlege announced the findings of her two-year review into three major long-term medical problems, of which sodium valproate was one. She said it was not known how many children had been affected by the drug but 20,000 was a \"reasonable estimate\". Baroness Cumberlege said babies were still being born today - estimates suggest hundreds a year - who had been exposed to sodium valproate despite the risk being well recognised and undisputed. She said the system did not know how to ensure every woman of childbearing age on the drug was continuously monitored and advised of the risks. In her report, she called for the establishment of a database of all women of child-bearing age who were taking the drug, to enable women to be contacted and reminded of the risk.

A crane was used to lift the work from the wall on Friday afternoon. It is not clear whether it has been removed for sale but gallery owner John Brandler said when he was offered it he told the owner to give it to Bristol. The mural, which was claimed by Banksy on Instagram shortly after it appeared, was spotted at the bottom of one of the steepest streets in the UK, Vale Street, on 12 December. When viewed with the road level, it looks as if the woman's sneeze is blowing the houses over. Since December, it has attracted a regular stream of visitors - up to 100 a day. In Nottingham, Banky's mural depicting a girl hula-hooping with a bicycle tire, was removed after being sold to Mr Brandler for a \"six-figure sum\". He said when the previous owner of the house in Totterdown contacted him about the mural, he told them it was a \"poison chalice\". \"I actually advised the previous owner to give it to the corporation of Bristol or to an art museum,\" he added. \"My personal view is that I think the house has been sold and the new people have moved in and covered it up.\" The house was in the process of being sold but Nick Makin, whose mother Aileen Martin owned it, said the sale was still going ahead, despite reports they had pulled out. He told the BBC, at the time, that he wanted the artwork to \"stay where it is\" and be protected. He also said had been \"looking at getting a covenant put into the deeds of the house\" to make sure the Banksy mural remained in place. Banksy's most recent work was on the side of Reading Prison.

Ms Gillard said she believed \"a good government was losing its way\" and vowed to revive Labor ahead of a general election expected in October. The party has suffered a sharp drop in support in opinion polls this year. A turn-around on a carbon trading scheme and a wrangle over a controversial mining tax led to a sharp slide in approval ratings for Mr Rudd's government. Ms Gillard, who was deputy prime minister before the surprise Wednesday night challenge to Mr Rudd, stood unopposed at a vote of the Labor Party's 112 members of parliament at a meeting on Thursday morning. Treasurer Wayne Swan was elected the new deputy leader, also unopposed. Ms Gillard was born in Barry in south Wales, moving to Australia with her family at the age of four. Emotional Emerging victorious from the party vote at Parliament House in Canberra, Ms Gillard told reporters: \"I came to the view that a good government was losing its way. \"I believe too I have a responsibility to make sure at the next election that Labor is there at its strongest.\" On the issue of a planned \"super tax\" on mining, which had dogged Mr Rudd, she said she wanted a consensus. \"We need to do more than consult, we need to negotiate... we need to end this uncertainty,\" she said. \"Today, I am throwing open the government's door to the mining industry and in return I ask the mining industry to open its mind.\" On Mr Rudd, she said: \"He was the leader who saw us through the global financial crisis. \"He came within a breath of brokering an international agreement on climate change.\" Mr Rudd, 52, repeatedly choked back tears as he and his family appeared before the media in Canberra. \"I have given it my absolute all and in that spirit I am proud of the achievements we have delivered to make this country fairer,\" he said.

Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. \"I can believe it,\" says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. \"I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid.\" Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, \"was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders\". \"The idea was that every American girl can relate to that.\" After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. \"The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was,\" says the director. \"I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it.

The port is passed from right to left and you never, ever, blow your nose on the napkin. To the socially gauche, meal-time manners are already baffling enough. And now it appears that, all along, an unwritten code has governed the opinions we express while sitting down to eat. In a speech, Baroness Warsi, co-chairman of the Tory Party, is expected to warn that prejudice towards Muslims had \"passed the dinner table test\" and become socially acceptable. Her remarks are no doubt designed to provoke a debate about tolerance and mutual respect within a multicultural society. But, intriguingly, they also suggest that prandial protocol is governed by a strict set of rules about discussing controversial issues. Just as the water cooler is associated with gossip or chats about last night's television, the dinner table has certain assumed conversational rules of engagement; don't upset Auntie Margaret by talking about Uncle Ian's first marriage, for instance. It also, too, carries with it associations of a cosy evening among friends or the \"hard-working families\" so often invoked by MPs. Indeed, this is not the first occasion that a British centre-right politician has invoked such imagery. During his time as Tory party leader, William Hague staked out a claim for his own brand of \"kitchen table Conservatism\" - to the extent, according to contemporary reports, of installing an actual wooden table at the heart of his party's headquarters to act as a reminder to staffers how swing voters might sit down to their chicken Kievs. In the most recent case, the meal-time analogy is used to make a point about the limits of polite discourse.

Failure to regulate it was described on Wednesday as \"one of the biggest scandals\" politicians had encountered since devolution. The scheme was supposed to encourage firms to switch from using oil and gas. They were encouraged to use renewable biomass boilers burning woodchip instead, but an overgenerous subsidy payment meant businesses piled in. With 20 years of guaranteed payments and the bulk of the money to be paid out of the Stormont budget, it has left taxpayers with a huge bill. Responsibility for overseeing the scheme was split between the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and officials from Ofgem E-Serve. The latter organisation administers government green energy schemes across the UK. Senior members of Ofgem E-Serve appeared before the assembly's Public Accounts Committee on Wednesday. They revealed there were no minutes taken of formal meetings between themselves and departmental officials between August 2014 and November the following year. Minutes only began to be taken when there was a huge spike in applications ahead of a planned change in the tariff, as firms rushed to get in on the more lucrative terms. Chris Poulton of Ofgem E-Serve said it had \"flagged up\" the lack of cost controls in the scheme, but the department had decided not to introduce them. An initial slow uptake in early years was followed by a huge spike in applications in Autumn 2015.

This follows the news last week that 3,500 troops had been drafted in to plug gaps after private security firm G4S failed to recruit enough guards for the Games. In the Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May answered an urgent question on Olympics security from shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper saying that it was \"untrue\" that ministers knew last year that there would be a shortfall in the numbers of security personnel they had been promised. \"G4S repeatedly assured us that they would overshoot their targets,\" she said. Mrs May said the government had taken immediate action after becoming aware of the shortage last Wednesday. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison said: \"Whilst some of the activity police officers are undertaking was not anticipated, plans were put in place to allow us to do this. \"Forces are making sure they make the best use of their resources locally to do all they can to minimise the impact on local policing.\" The forces involved include Dorset, Surrey, Hertfordshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Strathclyde, West Midlands, Thames Valley Police, and Greater Manchester Police.

None of that of course will stop individual MEPs and commentators from offering their assessment of where the balance lies between the EU and the UK after Theresa May's Brexit declaration. Brexit at-a-glance: What we learned from Theresa May Why Brexit is still undefined One German colleague said to me jokingly: \"I didn't realise that the EU had decided to leave the UK until I heard your prime minister's speech.\" And elsewhere in the corridors of the European Parliament you heard plenty of surprise at the confidence of the tone coming from London, the crispness of the decision to leave the single market and the sudden shafts of clarity after weeks in which the UK had appeared to not know what it wanted. That's not to say of course that everyone has been impressed, even though Mrs May was praised in some quarters both for realism and for clarity. It's worth remembering that most mainstream politicians in Europe view Brexit as an act of madness to be spoken of with hostility and incomprehension. Britain in this analysis has taken the decision to walk away from an institution that's been an engine of peace and prosperity.

But the BJP stopped short of a majority in Delhi after a surprise strong showing by the new Aam Aadmi Party. The polls are seen as a key test for the ruling Congress and the opposition BJP, ahead of 2014's general elections. The only state where the Congress has won is Mizoram in the north-east - the party has won 28 of the 40 seats and is leading in one more. The vote-counting is still going on there. In Rajasthan, the BJP won 162 assembly seats, leaving the Congress, which had been in power in the state, with just 21 seats. The BJP also retained power in the central states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. It won 165 seats against the 58 for Congress in Madhya Pradesh. But the contest was much closer in Chhattisgarh where the BJP won 49 seats - just three more than the majority needed to form a government - and the Congress finished its tally at 39. The Congress party also lost control of Delhi's 70-seat assembly. With 31 seats, the BJP fell just four short of a majority to form a government in the capital after a surprise strong showing by a new anti-corruption Aam Admi Party (AAP) or Common Man's Party. The AAP, led by former civil servant Arvind Kejriwal and born out of a strong anti-corruption movement that swept India two years ago, won 28 seats in the Delhi assembly elections. Mr Kejriwal said his party will \"play the role of constructive opposition and will not seek or give support from any party to form a government\". The BJP sprung a surprise on Sunday evening, saying that although it had emerged as the single largest party, it did not have the mandate to form the government. \"We respect the people's mandate and we will not indulge in breaking or supporting other parties or candidates to form the government,\" the BJP's chief ministerial candidate Harsh Vardhan said.

It was bought at Dominic Winter Auctions, based in Cirencester, by a telephone bidder from Chorley in Lancashire. The house is now a National Trust property which is open to the public. The hammer came down at \u00a34,100 with the final figure \u00a35,060 once the auction house's premium was added. 'Happily surprised' Auctioneer and valuer Chris Albury said: \"It was a bit nerve-wracking, as all these odd things are which can draw huge amounts of attention, but when it comes down to it only a small number of bidders actually wanting to buy such a thing. \"There were two phone bidders and a couple of commission bidders, so the bidding started at \u00a33,000 and crept up in \u00a3100 increments till it got to the final hammer of \u00a34,100. \"The winning phone bidder was Tracks, specialist Beatles dealers from Chorley, Lancashire - so it was back to the county from whence it just came.\" He added: \"We are very pleased indeed and the vendor Glen South, who had no expectations, is happily surprised.\" The house in Forthlin Road, where McCartney lived from the age of 13 to 22, was listed as a Grade II building by English Heritage last year. Several Beatles songs are believed to have been composed there, including Love Me Do, I Saw Her Standing There and When I'm Sixty-Four. When the McCartney family left the house in 1964 it was taken by Sheila Jones and her family, who refurbished it in about 1978, throwing out the doors, window fittings and tiles. Mr South, a local musician, heard about the door, and collected it from the house. He kept it behind his sofa at his home in Lancashire.

In a statement, it said poll cards were used to \"alert electors\" to the local election on 5 May as well as the alternative vote (AV) referendum, which is also taking place on the same day. Conservative councillor Keith Baker accused the other parties of point scoring. He added: \"It is a bit of a nonsense.

Once a close ally of President Jacob Zuma, the populist Mr Malema has become a fierce critic. His supporters threw stones at police who were blocking them in Johannesburg. The police erected a steel gate and barbed wire to close the main street leading to Luthuli House, the African National Congress headquarters where the hearing was held. Thousands of Mr Malema's supporters remained outside for much of the day, chanting and setting rubbish on fire. Some set on fire a T-shirt emblazoned with President Zuma's face, while other shouted \"Zuma must go\". The ANC later said the hearing would be moved to a secret location outside the city to reduce disruption, while Mr Malema urged his supporters to show restraint. One police officer and several journalists were injured in the clashes. 'Kingmaker' Mr Malema, who is charged along with five other top youth league officials, could be expelled from the ANC at the closed-door hearing. He was put on probation by the disciplinary committee last year after being found guilty of criticising Mr Zuma. Mr Malema, under separate investigation for alleged fraud and corruption, says he will accept the committee's ruling. \"We are taking responsibility for our actions and we are prepared for anything. We have always maintained that the ANC is our future, if that future is expulsion so be it,\" he said on the eve of the hearing. Correspondents say the youth league leader's calls to nationalise the mining sector and seize white-owned farm land have jarred with the party's leadership but have proved popular among his political base in impoverished black communities.

Ms Thompson, 21, died at Armley jail on 13 November. She had said she would kill herself if sent to a male prison. Justice Department minister Lord Faulks said the policy regarding transgender prisoners was currently under review. 'Dangerous thing to do' Baroness Barker said: \"Recent events have shown that placing transwomen in male estates is a dangerous thing to do. \"Transprisoners should be housed in the estate of their acquired gender in the first instance, and only moved to the other estate following a thorough investigation that has ruled out all other safe alternatives.\" Labour peer, and former EastEnders actor, Lord Cashman called for a review of the situation of all transpeople in jail, saying they should be moved to \"appropriate prisons according to their acquired gender in order to avoid a repeat of the tragedy that befell Vikki Thompson\". The death of Ms Thompson led to a review of the government's policy on the care of transgender prisoners. Ms Thompson's death came just weeks after another transgender woman was sent to a men's prison in Bristol. Tara Hudson, from Bath, was later transferred to a female prison after a campaign to get her moved.

But the report, from the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said this would lead to loss of income tax and \"significant unemployment\" costs in benefits. The TUC has urged the government to apply for EU state aid instead. UK Coal said a strong pound meant it had lost out to cheaper imported coal from the US, where the boom in shale gas has forced American coal miners to find new markets in Europe. 'Sustain our mines' TUC senior policy officer Philip Pearson said: \"We want a longer term public investment approach, around \u00a374m maximum, with a return of over \u00a380m by 2018. \"We have to sustain our mines for the time when coal prices go back up again.\" The TUC said this would be a \"cash neutral\" option, whereas carrying out the 18-month closure of the collieries would \"result in significant and tangible costs for the UK tax payer\". \"Over the three years from 2016 to 2018 this is likely to include [an estimated] \u00a375m loss in income tax and national insurance, and significant unemployment-related benefits associated with [an estimated] 2600 man-years of lost employment,\" the report said. Andrew Mackintosh of UK Coal said the company supported the TUC's efforts but the managed closure deal, which includes a \u00a310m government loan, was the only way to avoid insolvency and immediate closure. A government spokesman said it was reviewing the report and \"any use of taxpayers money has to represent clear value for money\". \"Private sector investors who wish to put in the substantial investment that would be needed to maintain the mines beyond Autumn 2015 without government support remain free to do so,\" he added.

Responses to Freedom of Information requests from 190 local authorities showed 36,609 home educated children. The government says it will continue to \"respect the rights of parents to home educate their children\". 'Suitable education' There is no legal obligation for parents to send their children to school, although they have to provide a \"suitable education\" at home. The figures show an increase of at least 10,399 pupils, up to almost 37,000, in a school population of about 9.5 million pupils. The home-educated figure may be an under-estimate. When parents withdraw a child from school they are recorded as being home educated, but children who never start school may not be reflected in the statistics. Among 190 councils with figures for 2014-15, there were 178 with data for the past three years, showing a 26% increase. For 133 of the local authorities, there was data from 2009-10 to 2014-15, showing that numbers had risen by almost two thirds. Graham Stuart, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Home Education, says it is possible councils have become better at recording information, and any figures are almost certainly an under-estimate. \"Local authorities have created groups to share best practice, and we're seeing what I hope is an increasing trend to stop treating home education as a problem to be regulated, and instead see it as an opportunity to be facilitated and supported,\" said the Conservative MP and former chairman of the education select committee.

Mr Siddhartha's company, Coffee Day Enterprises Limited, held an emergency board meeting on Monday to discuss his absence. In a statement, it appealed for \"the support and strength of all our stakeholders\". In a note to the stock exchange it said the company was \"professionally managed and led by a competent business team\" which would ensure the \"continuity\" of business. Who was VG Siddhartha? The 59-year-old coffee tycoon, who has been described in local media as \"soft spoken\" and \"self-effacing\", was not fond of the limelight. He was born to a family of coffee plantation owners, but his first company was an investment firm. He used the profits from it to enter the coffee business, according to PTI news agency. His decision to open a chain of cafes was inspired by a chat with the owners of Tchibo, a German coffee chain. Cafe Coffee Day opened its first outlet in the southern city of Bangalore in 1996. It wooed customers by offering them free internet with a cappuccino. Mr Siddhartha saw the chain become one of the biggest brands in the country. It remained competitive even against global rivals such as Starbucks. \"He is singularly responsible for increasing domestic coffee consumption in India. There can be no doubt about it. In those days, we were completely dependent upon the export market and the heavy regulations on its sale,\" Dr SM Kaverappa, former vice chairman of the Indian Coffee Board, told BBC Hindi.

Michael is one of thousands of people with a facial difference that the charity Changing Faces says endure multiple challenges on a daily basis. Its report, My Visible Difference, says: Over the years, Michael has learned to return the stares with a smile and he says having children has made him understand curiosity more than ever. \"When Jacob was two, he was just feeling my face and you could see in his eyes him noticing it was different,\" Michael says. \"When he was three, three and a half, he asked me about my face - I told him it was a burn.\" Michael says that despite the challenges, he has started to see his difference as an advantage for his children, as something that will make them more tolerant. \"It's kind of nice - it feels like I can teach them something I wouldn't be able to teach them otherwise, just about everyone being different and looking different and not being judgemental. \"Now I see it as a massive advantage for my children, having this burn, and they can ask me all the questions it would be difficult to ask anyone else. \"They will be more rounded and it will help them become better people.\" His wife, Jo, says: \"And it teaches them about empathy towards others and being kind, not judging people for the way they look.\" Michael's prosthetic ear, fitted when he was eight, also provides lots of fun for the family. \"They are fascinated with your ear that flips on and off - they do love the ear,\" laughs Jo.

He said a German-Turkish journalist detained by Turkey was a \"German agent\" and a member of the outlawed Kurdish militant group, the PKK. A source in Germany's foreign ministry told Reuters the claims were \"absurd\". Earlier German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she respected local authorities' decisions to cancel rallies that Turkey's justice and economy ministers had been scheduled to address. Turkey is trying to woo ethnic Turkish voters ahead of a key referendum. About 1.4m Turks living in Germany are eligible to vote in the April referendum, in which President Erdogan aims to win backing for sweeping new powers. The constitutional changes would boost Mr Erdogan's presidency and significantly weaken parliament's role. Turkish officials have been angered after local German officials withdrew permission for rallies in Gaggenau, Cologne and Frechen. Gaggenau authorities had said there was insufficient space for the rally, while Cologne officials said they had been misled about the purpose of the event. Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag, who had been due to speak in Gaggenau, said he saw \"old illnesses flaring up\" between the two Nato allies. Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu accused the German government of backing opposition to Mr Erdogan's planned constitutional changes. He said: \"You are not Turkey's boss.

Let's start with the tragedy: the Shanghai Bund stampede of New Year's Eve. Wasn't it torture enough for the grieving families in the days after this disaster, without being harried by officials to absolve the authorities, shun the media and stifle their questions about what went wrong? We've seen this so many times, most memorably with the harassment of some of the parents whose children were killed in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake after jerry-built schools collapsed on top of them. To stop treating victims like dangerous subversives ought to be a new year resolution for 2015 if the state is to bridge its trust deficit with citizens in times of crisis. One China, one flagpole For light relief, there was the faraway battle of the flags. A story which ricocheted between Washington DC, Beijing and Taipei for several days after the Chinese government, ever jealous of the principle of \"one China\", discovered that Taiwan's flag had been raised over its de facto embassy in Washington for the first time in 36 years. To begin with, Taiwanese press reports suggested that the American government had agreed to the flag-raising ceremony as long as it was low key but after Beijing's protest, a State Department spokeswoman said the US government did not know about the flag raising, did not agree to it, did not attend and was disappointed. At which point, Taiwan had to eat humble pie and express regret for causing embarrassment. Expensive friends Eating a much bigger slice of humble pie this week was Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who came cap in hand to China for loans to offset a dangerous slump back home as falling energy and commodity prices begin to bite. China is already Venezuela's largest creditor having lent $50bn over the past eight years. So how much more would Beijing be prepared to give now for the sake of influence in the region?

Adam and Charlie are said to have vanished within hours of each other from the Auchnafree Estate, near Dunkeld in Perthshire, on 18 April. The eagles' tags stopped working and neither bird has been traced. Police Scotland confirmed it was conducting an investigation into the disappearance of the eagles in an area between Loch Tay and Glen Almond. Raptor Persecution UK, which was monitoring the birds, said there was no evidence to suggest the estate had any involvement in the disappearances. Springwatch presenter Mr Packham said: \"We can't prove that harm has come to Adam and Charlie, nor who might have been responsible, but we can look at the circumstances, look at the science, look at the wider evidence and draw plausible conclusions. \"The Scottish government has already acknowledged that illegal raptor persecution is an ongoing problem. \"How many more golden eagles do we have to lose before that same government takes effective action?\" Charlie and Adam hatched at separate nests in the Loch Lomond & Trossachs National Park in 2017 and 2018 respectively.

Ipswich Borough Council's planning committee gave the project the green light, but told the developers, Fusion Lifestyle, to consider the impact of car parking in the area. The project has to wait to hear if it has been awarded a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) next month. If it gains the \u00a33.3m funding, the developers aim to reopen the pool in 2020. The Broomhill Pool Trust, which has been campaigning for the lido to reopen for 15 years, said it was \"absolutely delighted\" the project had passed this \"major milestone\". Under the plans, the Grade II-listed pool's water will be heated to \"take the chill off\", the architects said. The original lido was heated, but during World War Two the boilers were removed for the war effort and never replaced. The lido's Wicksteed diving boards will be restored and the facility will also include a fitness centre, new changing rooms and a small refreshment area. Peter Gardiner, chairman of the planning committee, said it would be \"great\" to see the pool where he learned to swim as a boy reopened. The council said the original 50m (165ft) pool and children's pool closed because it became too expensive to run. It still owns the pool and has pledged \u00a31m towards its restoration. The rest of the money will come from Fusion Lifestyle's own pocket. The first stage HLF grant, of \u00a3180,000, paid for specialist testing, surveys and design development for the restoration of the pool.

Ms Dolezal claimed her income was less than $500, but deposited $84,000 in her bank account without reporting it. She may serve a maximum of 15 years in prison and be made to repay the funds. The case began when an investigator from the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services learned Ms Dolezal had published a memoir, In Full Color. The investigation discovered Ms Dolezal would probably have received \"payments of $10,000 to $20,000 as advances against later royalties\", according to documents. Ms Dolezal had been reporting her monthly income as less than $500, claiming food and childcare assistance funds as a result. In 2015, Ms Dolezal quit her post at the Spokane, Washington, chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) amid outrage that she had pretended to be African American. Since then, she claimed, she had been unable to find work, according to the Spokesman-Review. Documents show Ms Dolezal said she was \"barely\" getting by, \"with help from friends and gifts\". Investigators discovered that between August 2015 and September 2017, she deposited around $84,000 into her bank account, but only reported $20,000 for a \"one-time job\" for \"speaking and voice overs\" in October 2017. Officials say when Ms Dolezal was interviewed by investigators last month, she said she had \"fully disclosed her information and asked what discrepancies\" were there, according to the Washington Post. When faced with the numbers, she reportedly told authorities \"she did not have to answer\". Ms Dolezal first made headlines in 2015 when her parents outed her as white.

And opposition members defeated the government to call for \"urgent action\" after a debate on Wednesday. Education Secretary John Swinney said a wide range of subjects was available, and that exam passes were on the up. But all four opposition parties united to reject his amendment and pass the Conservative motion for the debate. The Scottish Parliament's education committee is conducting an inquiry into whether teenagers have a wide enough choice of subjects in school, amid claims this may be narrowing. A recent report by the Reform Scotland think-tank said there had been a \"sharp reduction\" in subjects available at National 4 and 5 level. And the committee has now released the results of its own surveys on the subject - although because they were conducted online and were self-selecting, they are not necessarily representative of all pupils and parents across the country. A total of 241 pupils and 375 parents took part in the surveys. Of these, 56% of the pupils who responded said they had not been able to take all of the subjects they wanted to, while 76% of parents said this had been the case with their children. The parents who responded highlighted music as the subject most likely to be missed out on, while pupils complained most frequently about not being able to take modern studies. The most common reasons cited for classes not being available were: 'Useless subjects' One pupil said they were not allowed to take modern studies, so \"had to take art instead, which I hated\", while another said they were \"forced to take Spanish, a course I have no interest in, and miss a class I really enjoy\". Another wrote that the range of choice \"led me to take useless subjects as filler for my timetable, which led to a lot of wasted time\".

The extremist Islamist group came to international prominence in 2014 when it seized large parts of Syria and Iraq. IS imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people, carried out countless atrocities, destroyed cultural heritage, and generated billions of dollars in revenue from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. After five years of fierce and bloody battles, local forces, backed by world powers, have driven IS out of all the territory it once controlled. But the group is by no means defeated. Experts say it will return to its insurgent roots while rebuilding and remains a global threat. What does it want? IS is what is widely known as a jihadist group. Jihadists see violent struggle as necessary to eradicate obstacles to restore God's rule on Earth and defend the Muslim community against what they consider to be infidels and apostates. IS wants a \"caliphate\" - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth (caliph) - that extends across the Islamic world. The group justifies its attacks on Muslims and non-Muslims alike by drawing on extreme interpretations of Islamic texts. What are its origins? IS grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq, which was formed by Sunni Muslim militants after the US-led invasion in 2003. In 2011, the group - by then known as Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) - joined the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, where it found a safe haven. It also took advantage of the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and Sunni anger at the sectarian policies of its Shia-led government. In 2013, ISI began seizing territory in Syria and changed its name to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis\/Isil). The next year Isis overran large parts of Iraq, proclaimed its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as caliph, and became known as \"Islamic State\". How much land did it control? At its peak, IS ruled over 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) stretching across the Iraq-\n\nSummary:","483":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

Mr Khashoggi was murdered on 2 October on a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing on rogue agents but denied claims that the crown prince had knowledge of the operation. US media have reported that the CIA believes Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder. Mr Trump's statement said: \"[It] could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!\" Later on Tuesday, Mr Trump said that the CIA had not made a \"100%\" determination on the killing. In an interview on Sunday, the president told Fox News that he had refused to listen to a recording of Khashoggi's murder provided by Turkey, calling it \"a suffering tape\". A dark shadow for years to come By the BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Riyadh For Saudis, and especially Saudi leaders, there will be a sigh of relief.

He said many of his school's subjects could end up being under threat. Mr Rolfe said: \"The dangers are, and I'm thinking very carefully about this, you end up trying to jump through hoops to claw your way up a league table and the victims are the children, families and the curriculum because it becomes narrowed. \"We've introduced electrical work, we've got children who can wire a whole ringmain, we've got plumbing, we've got carpentry, we've got catering and all of those would have to go.\" Vulnerable children Mr Rolfe said lower grades were to be expected at the four States non-selective secondary schools because of the way the education system works. He said putting pressure on schools to achieve better exam results could leave them reluctant to educate the most vulnerable children, adding that parents should look beyond exam results to the whole ethos of a school. In February concerns were raised that past exam results showed pupils in States secondary schools achieved lower grades than most teenagers in the UK. Jersey's education department released the headline results on Thursday but said it would take up to eight weeks to release individual school performances.

It had previously estimated the the economy would grow by 1.2% in 2015. Russia's reliance on tax revenues from the oil industry makes it particularly sensitive to price movements. Household disposable incomes are also forecast to decline by as much as 2.8%, compared with a previous estimate that they would grow by 0.4%. The sharp revision in Russia's economic forecast is the first admission from the government that the economy will contract. \"The current prognosis is based on a drop in GDP by 0.8% in 2015, against the previous prognosis of growth by 1.2%,\" deputy prime minister Alexi Vedev said. Budget On Monday, the rouble suffered its biggest one-day fall since 1998. The currency slid almost 9% against the dollar before rallying after suspected central bank intervention. The currency has already lost 40% in value this year. The Russian finance ministry has also not ruled out spending more than 500 billion roubles from the budget's Reserve Fund next year. The 2015-2017 budget allows for spending of up to 500bn roubles (\u00a35.9bn) next year from the Reserve Fund, but Maxim Oreshkin, head of the finance ministry's long-term strategic planning department, said it was possible the government could spend more to support the economy. He added that if the average oil price were $80 per barrel in 2015, the finance ministry's forecast for a fall in GDP was in line with the economy ministry's prediction of a 0.8% contraction. He also said that a scenario in which the oil price averaged $60 a barrel in 2015 was pessimistic, and at that price, the Russian economy would contract as forecast in the central bank's \"stress scenario\".

RSPB Scotland's Calum Murray said the charity had to prioritise based on the needs of species and habitats. However, he said it would continue to monitor numbers and support nature-based tourism through other projects. The story of the trail dates back to 2001 when red kites were locally extinct in Dumfries and Galloway. A re-introduction campaign was started which ran until 2005. The kite trail was founded in October 2003 as a wildlife viewing initiative aimed at raising public awareness of the birds and promoting the region as a tourist destination. One of its goals was to help the recovery after the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001 with studies showing it has contributed millions of pounds to the economy. It has also seen numbers thrive with more than 1,000 chicks fledged since the project began and now 130 breeding pairs across the area. RSPB Scotland said that thanks to the initiative - and other successful re-introductions across the UK - the red kite had gone from being a red-listed bird, the highest level of conservation concern, to a green-listed bird, the lowest level. The charity said incidents of illegal persecution against kites were still recorded, but their population was \"stable and growing\". Mr Murray - a community liaison officer for more than 12 years - said that meant the time was right for the charity to step back. \"The Galloway Kite Trail has been a huge part of my life, and it's been a privilege to be involved in something so worthwhile, with so many tangible and knock-on benefits for wildlife and for people,\" he said. \"It's also been a pleasure working with the businesses and landowners involved, who have all contributed to the trail's success as a visitor attraction and will, I'm sure, continue to support it. \"It's definitely sad to be stepping back, but as a conservation charity, the RSPB has to prioritise its efforts based on the needs of spe\n\nSummary:","492":"Read the following article and summarize the key points in 5 to 10 sentences.

A review, by the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Group, questions if this was caused by the way the virus spread. But it warns there is a \"small window to learn\" ahead of any further wave. The report says it is \"critical\" to learn from cases as history shows \"further waves could be more severe\" and it could be years before the impact on Wales and the UK is known. \"There is a small window for us to learn from the terrible loss of life that the virus has brought,\" the Examining Deaths in Wales Associated with Covid-19 report warns. It examines statistics to looks at how the virus has hit different parts of the population in Wales and across the UK. It states the virus seemed to spread into Wales by travelling along \"major routes from England\", \"along the M4 from Bristol\" and from Chester and Liverpool. The report questions whether this extra time to prepare and lock down could be one reason why there were proportionally fewer deaths in Wales than in England. The review examines Office of National Statistic figures which, unlike Public Health Wales' daily figures, include all deaths in care homes and people's own homes. They also include deaths of people suspected by doctors of having coronavirus, not just confirmed cases. It says that between 1 March and 31 May, 2,257 people in Wales died with coronavirus.

The rise, blamed on increased costs, comes just days after British Gas and Npower said they were raising prices. A 9% price rise by SSE - which trades as Scottish Hydro, Swalec and Southern Electric - has just come into effect. Consumer groups have often argued that energy firms raise prices in packs. 'Difficult time' The company said it had to increase prices for customers because the cost of transporting gas and electricity to customers' homes, and of energy efficiency programmes, had risen. \"We work hard to protect our customers and we regret that we have had to announce a price increase,\" said Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of retail and generation at Scottish Power. \"We will be writing to all those affected customers over the coming weeks explaining what the price increase will mean for them. \"We understand that this is a difficult time for many people and we encourage our customers to contact us.\" The company announced a 5% gas price cut in February. The latest changes mean that direct debit customers will see a gas and electricity price increase of 8.7%. Those who pay by cash and cheque every quarter will see prices rise by 1.4%. Meanwhile, those on prepayment meters, which are often those with financial difficulties, will see a price rise of 8.6%. However, these meters have greater running costs for energy firms.

Contempt of court laws exist to ensure people get fair trials. The idea is that juries must not be influenced by anything but the evidence they hear in court. The rules apply to everyone from journalists to people posting comments on social media, and even jurors. If someone interferes with a trial, the defendants can walk free and a new trial might have to be held. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years in prison, but it can also be punished with an unlimited fine. The law is set out in the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Contempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing \"active\" criminal proceedings. Proceedings become \"active\" when a suspect is arrested. Someone could also be in contempt by actions including taking photographs or film, recording what is said in court or talking to a jury member about a case. Why was Tommy Robinson found guilty of contempt? Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, committed contempt of court by broadcasting footage of defendants accused of sexual exploitation. The hour-long broadcast, outside Leeds Crown Court in May 2018, was seen by thousands of people. Lawyers for the Attorney General said reporting restrictions had been put in place. These postponed the publication of any details of the case until the end of a series of linked trials, involving 29 defendants. This was to stop the juries in those cases being influenced. They also said the manner in which Robinson filmed the defendants at court was a problem. The aggressive confrontation could have influenced those on bail not to co-operate with the trial. Judge Dame Victoria Sharp said when explaining the decision, that Mr Robinson encouraged \"vigilante action\" in his Facebook Live. She also said that the video could have \"seriously impeded\" justice over a sexual grooming gang's trial.

The motive for the attack is unclear, though some reports on social media say the woman had a grievance against the government. The woman, whose surname was given as Liu, was arrested at the scene. Video circulating on social media shows injured children being led out the school - some of them appear to have knife wounds to their faces. Other footage appears to show police taking the alleged attacker away. Police have denied media reports that two children died, using social media to urge people not to pass on \"rumours\". Violent crime is relatively rare in China, but it has faced a string of unrelated knife attacks in school and kindergartens in recent years. They have usually been carried out by people seeking revenge against officials or individuals, or who are suffering from mental health problems.

Nottingham Magistrates' Court heard the 37-year-old, of Nottingham Road in Eastwood, had drunk a bottle of whisky on the morning he made the call. Naylor pleaded guilty to one count of sending a threatening message. He was sentenced to four weeks in prison, suspended for a year, and ordered to pay costs of \u00a3207. The court heard the voicemail left by Naylor included swearing and him saying he wanted to \"kill\" Mr Corbyn. When interviewed by police, Naylor said he had no political stance and believed Mr Corbyn was the leader of the Liberal Democrats party. Anthony Cheung, prosecuting, said Naylor told officers he did not know any politicians, but accepted anyone listening to the message would not have known \"what he was capable of and may therefore have believed the threat\". Defending, Paul McLeod said Naylor - who suffers from alcoholism - could not remember making the call, which was made on the anniversary of his mother's death, and was \"absolutely ashamed about it\". \"Leaflets had been dropping through his door,\" he said. \"In his drunken stupor that was paramount in his mind that morning.\" Roger Clay, chief magistrate at the hearing, told Naylor the prison sentence was being suspended \"because you need to get your mental health sorted out\".

Each episode is now broadcast in more than 200 nations and territories and seen by 350 million people. There is though one notable exception. The world's most populous country has managed to hold out against Messrs Clarkson, Hammond and May's quest for complete global domination and remained a Top-Gear-free-zone. Until now. But when the first episode finally made it onto Chinese screens last week, via the state-run Dragon TV network, there was something missing. China has gone for a presenter line-up with - how shall we put this - a little less mileage on the clock. The Top Gear Three, described as many things over the years but never \"youthful\", have been replaced with a far more polished trio. Cheng Lei, the new Clarkson, is a well-manicured Dragon TV host, all suits and sharp waistcoats. As for his two sidekicks, Ren Xianqi is an actor, singer and racing driver and Tian Liang is an Olympic diving gold medallist. There is not an un-tucked shirt or an un-kempt hair-do in sight. But what about the content itself and the some of those key qualities - the irreverence and occasional ability to offend - for which the UK version is so loved and sometimes loathed? Will they too be polished away? Fans of the show will be relieved to know that the same grungy studio is still there, as is the laddish banter and the sense of pure, petrol fuelled fun. There's a Chinese Stig - the mystery, white-helmeted test-track driver - and the Star-in-a-Reasonably-Priced-Car feature remains, allowing the Chinese version, if the first episode is anything to go by, to lean even more heavily on celebrity guests. The point of making local-versions of TV shows is that it allows audiences to connect with them more intimately, without the need for subtitles or voice-overs, and it allows the programme makers to better

The fund has also faced criticism for not taking sufficient action to address the deficit, such as increasing contributions or reducing benefits. The government has also been accused of not taking sufficient action to address the issue, as the pension fund is not subject to the same rules as private sector schemes and is not required to disclose information about its deficit.

The project is called DUNE (Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment). This project will involve the development of the world's most high intensity neutrino stream. The stream of neutrinos will travel 800 miles underground from Fermilab toward a massive detector based in South Dakota. The project is called DUNE and it was formed earlier this year. Among the goals of the project will be to capture neutrino streams coming from a distant supernova. The collaboration is the product of the merging of European and American projects. The meeting that was held at Fermilab in April, 2015, had 700 signatures. The collaboration will involve a new name and commitments from the US, Europe, India, and other regions to go forward with the project. Neutrinos are elementary cosmic building blocks and are nicknamed ghost particles. The property that makes neutrinos so difficult to observe is that they are light and have no electric charge, so they pass harmlessly through other matter.

The researchers calculated that, of 1,000 non-smoking men and 1,000 non-smoking women each who drank one bottle of wine a week, around 10 extra men and 14 extra women could develop cancer during their lifespan. The cancer harms of alcohol intake were that alcohol intake was linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in women, as well as cancer risks of the gastrointestinal tract and liver in men. The overall picture of cancer risk is extremely complex and nuanced, so it's important to keep in mind that this new study is subject to a number of assumptions.

After being assessed by an out-of-hours GP, she was referred to the children's ward at the hospital where a doctor diagnosed tonsillitis and ruled out antibiotics. The doctor's diagnosis was challenged by the family who sought a second opinion, but the doctor said he would check with his boss. However, 45 minutes later the doctor returned and said his superior had said that the family was free to go. The girl's condition deteriorated and she was diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis and was subsequently rushed to a hospital in Liverpool. However, she had already suffered severe brain damage and was not expected to survive. After several months of intensive care, she was released from hospital but required 24-hours care. Tragically, she passed away while on a family holiday to Florida in March 2013. The jury inquest is being held to investigate how she was treated and diagnosed at the Wrexham Maelor hospital in March 2006, rather than the circumstance of her death.","230":"Key Point #1 Key Point #2 Key Point #3 Key Point #4 Key Point #5 Key Point #6 Key Point #7 Key Point #8 Key Point #9 Key Point #10 Key Point #11 Key Point #12 Key Point #13 Key Point #14 Key Point #15 Key Point #16 Key Point #17 Key Point #18 Key Point #15 Key Point #17 Key Point #18 Key Point #19 Key Point #20 Key Point #21 Key Point #23 Key Point #24 Key Point #25 Key Point #26 Key Point #27","231":"The following is a list of the most popular movies and TV shows in the United States.

The researchers found that toddlers who spend more time using touchscreens sleep less at night and more during the day. Specifically, every hour spent using a touchscreen was linked to 15 minutes less sleep. However, it was also noted that toddlers who use touchscreen devices actively, such as by swiping rather than just watching, showed a more accelerated development of fine motor skills. The researchers suggest that parents should limit the amount of time spent in front of the TV as a guideline for the use of touchscreen devices, similar to screen time limits.
